The "Quantum Nexus Protocol" is a sophisticated, decentralized platform designed to foster and fund innovative projects. It moves beyond traditional crowdfunding by integrating advanced concepts like **reputation-weighted governance**, **AI-driven project insights**, **dynamic funding allocation tied to milestones**, **commitment staking**, and **evolving "Catalyst NFTs"**. The goal is to create a self-correcting and adaptive ecosystem where community wisdom, verifiable external data, and aligned incentives drive the success of new ventures.

/**
 * @title QuantumNexusProtocol
 * @dev An innovative, decentralized protocol for fostering and funding groundbreaking projects.
 *      It integrates reputation-weighted governance, verifiable AI insights for project evaluation,
 *      dynamic funding allocation, commitment staking, and evolving 'Catalyst NFTs' to create
 *      a self-sustaining and adaptive ecosystem for innovation.
 *
 * @outline
 * 1.  **Core Protocol Management & Setup:** Initializes the protocol, manages owner functions, fee settings, and emergency pausing.
 * 2.  **Reputation System Interface:** Interacts with an external Reputation Token contract to track and leverage user reputation for governance.
 * 3.  **Project Lifecycle Management:** Handles project proposals, community voting, milestone submissions, and status updates, including deactivation.
 * 4.  **AI Oracle & Adaptive Insights:** Manages integration with a designated AI Oracle for project viability scores and insights, allowing community challenges.
 * 5.  **Funding & Resource Allocation:** Facilitates user deposits, project commitment staking, and controlled distribution of funds based on project progress and community decisions.
 * 6.  **Dispute Resolution & Governance:** Provides a structured mechanism for resolving disputes related to projects or insights, involving reputation-weighted voting.
 * 7.  **Dynamic Assets & Incentives (Catalyst NFTs):** Manages the awarding and dynamic updating of special NFTs that represent project success or significant contributions.
