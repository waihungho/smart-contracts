 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to submit art,
 * curators to manage exhibitions, community members to vote on art and exhibitions,
 * and utilize advanced features like dynamic NFT traits, AI-assisted art evaluation,
 * and decentralized copyright management.

 * **Contract Outline:**
 *  - **Core Art Management:**
 *      - submitArt: Artists submit their artwork with metadata.
 *      - approveArt: Curators approve submitted artwork for the collective.
 *      - rejectArt: Curators reject submitted artwork.
 *      - getArtDetails: Retrieve details of a specific artwork.
 *      - listApprovedArt: List all approved artworks.
 *      - burnArt: Burn an artwork (remove from the collective - governance voted).
 *  - **Exhibition Management:**
 *      - createExhibition: Curators create new art exhibitions.
 *      - addArtToExhibition: Curators add approved artwork to an exhibition.
 *      - removeArtFromExhibition: Curators remove artwork from an exhibition.
 *      - startExhibitionVoting: Start community voting for an exhibition theme/curation.
 *      - voteForExhibitionTheme: Community members vote for exhibition themes.
 *      - finalizeExhibition: Finalize an exhibition based on voting and curator's choice.
 *      - getExhibitionDetails: Retrieve details of an exhibition.
 *      - listActiveExhibitions: List all currently active exhibitions.
 *  - **Dynamic NFT & AI Features:**
 *      - mintArtNFT: Mint an NFT for an approved artwork with dynamic traits.
 *      - updateNFTTraits: Update dynamic NFT traits based on community interaction/events.
 *      - requestAIEvaluation: Request an AI evaluation score for an artwork (off-chain oracle).
 *      - setAIEvaluationScore: Set the AI evaluation score for an artwork (oracle callback).
 *  - **Governance & Community:**
 *      - proposeNewCurator: Community proposes a new curator.
 *      - voteOnCuratorProposal: Community votes on curator proposals.
 *      - setVotingDuration: Owner sets the voting duration for proposals.
 *      - setQuorumPercentage: Owner sets the quorum percentage for proposals.
 *      - donateToCollective: Community members donate to the collective treasury.
 *      - withdrawDonations: Owner/Governance can withdraw donations for collective purposes.

 *  16. `updateNFTTraits(uint256 _tokenId, string _newTraits)`: Updates the dynamic traits of an artwork NFT (governance/event-driven).
 *  17. `requestAIEvaluation(uint256 _artId)`: Requests an AI evaluation score for an artwork from an off-chain oracle.
 *  18. `setAIEvaluationScore(uint256 _artId, uint256 _aiScore, bytes _signature)`: Oracle callback to set the AI evaluation score, verified by signature.
 *  19. `proposeNewCurator(address _newCurator)`: Community members propose a new curator.
 *  20. `voteOnCuratorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Community members vote on curator proposals.
