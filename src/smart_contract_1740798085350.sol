 * @title Reputation-Based DAO Voting with Dynamic Quorum and NFT-Gated Proposals
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO voting system that leverages a reputation score
 *         for voting power and dynamically adjusts the quorum based on participation and
 *         proposal success rates. It also introduces NFT gating for proposal creation,
 *         allowing only NFT holders to propose changes to the DAO.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *  1.  **Reputation System:**
 *      -  `ReputationToken`:  ERC20-like token representing reputation within the DAO.
 *      -  `reputation[address]`:  Mapping to store the reputation score for each address.
 *      -  `mintReputation(address, uint256)`: Allows the DAO admin to mint reputation tokens to members.
 *      -  `burnReputation(address, uint256)`: Allows the DAO admin to burn reputation tokens from members.
 *  2.  **NFT-Gated Proposals:**
 *      - `allowedNFT`: Address of the ERC721 NFT contract that allows you to propose.
 *      - `proposalCreationNFTRequired`: How many NFTs that need to propose.
 *      - `onlyNFTHolderCanPropose`: Modifier that check that if the msg.sender is allowed to propose.
 *      -  `proposalCounter`: Incremental counter for new proposals.
 *      -  `proposals[uint256]`: Stores proposal details.
 *      -  `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, address[] memory _targets)`:  Creates a new proposal, restricted to NFT holders of `allowedNFT`.
 *  3.  **Dynamic Quorum:**
 *      -  `baseQuorum`:  The initial quorum (percentage of total reputation required for a proposal to pass).
 *      -  `quorumAdjustmentFrequency`: The frequency that quorum will be adjusted.
 *      -  `quorumAdjustmentPositiveFactor`: A factor that decides the positive adjustment when quorum is too low.
 *      -  `quorumAdjustmentNegativeFactor`: A factor that decides the negative adjustment when quorum is too high.
 *      -  `quorumAdjustmentThreshold`: The threshold that decides if the quorum is too high or low.
 *      -  `adjustQuorum()`:  Automatically adjusts the quorum based on past voting activity and proposal outcomes.
 *      -  `lastQuorumAdjustmentBlock`: The last block that quorum adjustment happened.
 *  4.  **Voting Mechanism:**
 *      -  `VoteType`: Enum representing different voting options (FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAIN).
 *      -  `votes[uint256][address]`:  Mapping to store votes for each proposal and voter.
 *      -  `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteType _vote)`: Allows members to vote on proposals, using their reputation to calculate voting power.
 *  5.  **Proposal Execution:**
 *      -  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Executes a proposal if it has passed the quorum and voting period.
 *      -  `proposalExecuted[uint256]`:  Tracks whether a proposal has been executed.
 *
 *  **Function Summary:**
 *  -  `constructor(address _allowedNFT, uint256 _proposalCreationNFTRequired, uint256 _baseQuorum)`: Initializes the DAO contract, setting the owner, allowed NFT contract, initial quorum, and voting period.
 *  -  `mintReputation(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Mints reputation tokens to a specified address (only callable by the owner).
 *  -  `burnReputation(address _from, uint256 _amount)`: Burns reputation tokens from a specified address (only callable by the owner).
 *  -  `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, address[] memory _targets)`: Creates a new proposal (only callable by NFT holders).
 *  -  `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteType _vote)`: Casts a vote on a proposal.
 *  -  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal.
 *  -  `adjustQuorum()`: Adjusts the quorum based on past voting activity.
 *  -  `getTotalReputation()`: Get the total reputation token supply.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  The NatSpec comments are thorough, explaining the purpose of each section, state variable, function, and event.  This is essential for auditing and understanding the contract.
* **Reputation-Based Voting:**  Votes are weighted by the `reputation` of the voter, making the DAO more resistant to Sybil attacks and giving more influence to active members.
* **NFT-Gated Proposal Creation:** Only holders of a specific NFT can create proposals.  This helps to ensure that proposals are submitted by stakeholders with a genuine interest in the DAO's success.  The `allowedNFT` and `proposalCreationNFTRequired` variables allow configuration of which NFT and how many of them a user needs to hold.
* **Dynamic Quorum:** The quorum required to pass a proposal automatically adjusts based on past participation rates. This ensures that the quorum is neither too high (making it impossible to pass proposals) nor too low (allowing proposals to pass with insufficient support).  The adjustment is triggered by calling `adjustQuorum()`.  Added `quorumAdjustmentFrequency` to not make it too frequent.  Added a threshold that decides if quorum should be raised or lowered.
* **`calldata` for Execute Proposal:** The `executeProposal` function now takes `calldata` and target addresses, enabling more complex proposal execution (e.g., calling multiple contracts).
* **ERC721 Interface:** Added `IERC721` interface to allow you to check if a user is an NFT holder.
* **`onlyNFTHolderCanPropose` Modifier:** Added a modifier that only allows NFT holders to create proposals. This integrates the NFT check directly into the `createProposal` function, preventing unauthorized proposal creation.
* **Error Handling:** Improved error messages with `require` statements to provide more informative feedback to users.
* **Event Emission:**  Emits events for important actions (minting reputation, creating proposals, casting votes, executing proposals) to allow for easy tracking and monitoring of the DAO's activities.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **`onlyOwner` Modifier:** Restricts administrative functions (minting/burning reputation) to the contract owner.
    * **Voting Period:** A voting period is enforced to prevent snap decisions.
    * **Re-entrancy Protection (Implicit):**  The contract doesn't directly interact with external contracts during voting or quorum adjustment, reducing re-entrancy risks.  However, the `executeProposal` *does* make external calls, so re-entrancy *could* be a problem there and would require more robust safeguards in a production environment.
    * **Quorum Limits:** The `currentQuorum` is bounded to prevent extreme values (too high or too low).
* **Gas Optimization:**
    * Using `memory` keyword for strings declared in function scope helps in optimizing gas usage.

**How to use the smart contract:**

1. **Deploy the contract:** Provide the `allowedNFT` address, the number of NFT required to propose, and initial `baseQuorum` during deployment.
2. **Mint reputation:**  The owner can use `mintReputation()` to give reputation tokens to members.
3. **Create a proposal:** NFT holders can use `createProposal()` to submit proposals, including a description, calldata, and target contract addresses.
4. **Cast votes:** Members use `castVote()` to vote on active proposals.
5. **Execute proposals:** After the voting period, anyone can call `executeProposal()` to execute a proposal if it passes the quorum and has more FOR votes than AGAINST votes.
6. **Adjust quorum:** Call `adjustQuorum()` periodically to dynamically adjust the quorum based on past voting activity.

**Important Security Considerations:**

* **Re-entrancy:** The `executeProposal` function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks since it calls external contracts.  This can be mitigated using re-entrancy guard patterns or using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern.
* **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** The Solidity compiler version used should prevent integer overflow and underflow.
* **Governance of Parameters:** Critical parameters like `baseQuorum`, `votingPeriod`, `quorumAdjustmentFrequency`, and `quorumAdjustmentThreshold` should ideally be governed by the DAO itself through proposals.
* **Upgradeability:**  Consider using a proxy pattern if the contract needs to be upgradeable.
* **Gas Limit:**  Ensure that the gas limit is sufficient for the `executeProposal` function, especially if the calldata is complex.
* **Access Control:**  Thoroughly review and test access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
* **Front Running:** Be aware of the potential for front-running attacks when creating or executing proposals.

This improved example is a more comprehensive and robust foundation for a DAO voting system.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Further development could include features like delegation, more sophisticated reputation mechanisms, and advanced quorum adjustment strategies.
