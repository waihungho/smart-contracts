/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI (Conceptual Example)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * with advanced features for art submission, community voting, dynamic pricing,
 * fractional ownership, AI-powered curation suggestions, and more.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art Management:**
 *    - `submitArt(string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to submit their artwork with metadata URI.
 *    - `approveArt(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to approve submitted artwork for listing.
 *    - `rejectArt(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to reject submitted artwork.
 *    - `setArtPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Curator function to set the initial price of an artwork.
 *    - `getArtDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Public view function to retrieve details of an artwork.
 *    - `withdrawArt(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artist function to withdraw their submitted artwork before approval.
 *
 * **2. Community Voting & Governance:**
 *    - `voteForArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Community members can vote to approve or reject artworks.
 *    - `getArtworkVoteCount(uint256 _artworkId)`: Public view function to get the current vote count for an artwork.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Platform owner function to set the voting duration for artworks.
 *    - `setVotingQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Platform owner function to set the voting quorum for artwork approval.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic Pricing & Auctions:**
 *    - `buyArt(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artwork at the current dynamic price.
 *    - `startAuction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _startingPrice, uint256 _auctionDuration)`: Curator function to start an auction for an artwork.
 *    - `bidOnAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Allows users to bid on an active artwork auction.
 *    - `endAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Function to end an auction, automatically awarding to the highest bidder.
 *
 * **4. Fractional Ownership (NFT Splitting):**
 *    - `fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Curator function to fractionalize an approved artwork into NFT fractions.
 *    - `buyFraction(uint256 _fractionId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to buy fractions of an artwork.
 *    - `redeemFraction(uint256 _fractionId, uint256 _amount)`: (Conceptual) Function for fraction holders to potentially redeem fractions (e.g., for governance rights or future benefits - implementation detail left open).
 *
 * **5. AI-Powered Curation Suggestions (Conceptual & Off-chain Integration - Event Emission):**
 *    - `requestCurationSuggestion(string memory _artistStyle, string memory _theme)`:  Function for curators to request AI-powered artwork suggestions (emits an event for off-chain AI processing).
 *    - `setCurationSuggestion(uint256 _suggestionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to register an AI-suggested artwork (linked to an off-chain AI process).
 *
 * **6. Platform Management & Utility:**
 *    - `setPlatformOwner(address _newOwner)`: Platform owner function to change platform ownership.
 *    - `setGalleryFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Platform owner function to set the gallery commission fee (percentage).
 *    - `withdrawGalleryBalance()`: Platform owner function to withdraw collected gallery fees.
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Platform owner function to pause core contract functionalities.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Platform owner function to unpause contract functionalities.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) Theme:**  The core concept itself is trendy and relevant to the growing NFT and decentralized creator economy. It's more than just a marketplace; it aims to be a community-driven gallery.

2.  **Community Voting & Governance:**  Incorporating community voting for artwork approval adds a layer of decentralization and community involvement in curation, going beyond simple curator-only models.

3.  **Dynamic Pricing & Auctions:**
    *   **`buyArt()` with Dynamic Price:** While not fully dynamic in the sense of algorithmic pricing, the `setArtPrice()` function allows curators to adjust prices based on market conditions or demand, making it more flexible than fixed-price listings.
    *   **Auctions (`startAuction`, `bidOnAuction`, `endAuction`):**  Implementing auction functionality adds a competitive element to art sales and price discovery, catering to higher-value artworks or generating more excitement.

4.  **Fractional Ownership (NFT Splitting) (`fractionalizeArt`, `buyFraction`, `redeemFraction`):**  This is a more advanced concept that allows for democratizing ownership of potentially expensive artworks. Fractionalization can lower the barrier to entry for art investment and create new forms of community engagement around art ownership. The `redeemFraction` is conceptual and left open for further creative implementation (governance, future benefits, etc.).

5.  **AI-Powered Curation Suggestions (`requestCurationSuggestion`, `setCurationSuggestion`):** This is a forward-thinking, trendy feature leveraging AI's potential in the art world. While the actual AI processing is off-chain, the smart contract provides the interface for curators to request and integrate AI-driven suggestions, potentially leading to discovery of new artists and trends.  The event-based approach is key to bridging on-chain and off-chain AI processes.

6.  **Artwork Status Enum & Detailed Artwork Struct:**  Using an `enum` (`ArtworkStatus`) and a detailed `Artwork` struct makes the contract more robust and easier to manage different stages of an artwork's lifecycle within the gallery (Pending, Approved, Listed, Auction, etc.).

7.  **Curator Management:**  Having designated curators with specific roles and permissions adds a layer of moderation and quality control to the gallery.

8.  **Platform Management Functions:**  Functions for platform owner to manage fees, pause/unpause the contract, and change ownership are essential for the long-term administration and security of the platform.

9.  **Events for Transparency:**  Extensive use of events throughout the contract ensures transparency and allows for off-chain monitoring and indexing of important actions within the DAAG.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Conceptual Example:** This is a conceptual example. A production-ready smart contract would require thorough security audits, gas optimization, and more robust error handling.
*   **NFT Integration:**  This contract focuses on the gallery logic. To fully realize an art gallery, it would typically be integrated with an NFT contract to represent the ownership of the artworks. This example abstracts away the NFT part for simplicity and focuses on the gallery's novel features.
*   **Off-chain AI:** The AI curation suggestion feature relies on off-chain processing. A real implementation would require a backend system to listen for `CurationSuggestionRequested` events, interact with an AI model, and then call `setCurationSuggestion` back on the smart contract.
*   **Fraction Redemption Logic:** The `redeemFraction` function is deliberately left conceptual.  The specific logic for redemption (what benefits fraction holders get) would need to be defined based on the desired utility of the fractions. It could involve governance rights, access to exclusive content, or even future revenue sharing mechanisms.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For a production contract, gas optimization would be critical. Techniques like using `calldata` where appropriate, efficient data structures, and careful loop management would be necessary.
*   **Security:** Security is paramount in smart contracts.  This example includes basic modifiers like `onlyOwner` and `onlyCurator`, but a real-world contract would need rigorous security audits to prevent vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and others.
