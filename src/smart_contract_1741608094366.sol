 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Asset Basket (DDAB)
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @notice A smart contract implementing a decentralized, dynamic asset basket with advanced features.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Initialization and Configuration:**
 *   1. `constructor(string _basketName, string _basketSymbol)`: Initializes the DDAB contract with a name and symbol.
 *   2. `initializeBasket(address[] memory _initialAssets, uint256[] memory _initialWeights)`:  Sets up the initial basket composition with assets and their weights.
 *   3. `setGovernanceToken(address _governanceTokenAddress)`:  Sets the address of the governance token for voting and decisions.
 *   4. `setRebalancingStrategy(uint8 _strategyId, bytes memory _strategyParams)`:  Sets the rebalancing strategy and its parameters (e.g., threshold-based, periodic).
 *   5. `setFeeStructure(uint256 _depositFee, uint256 _withdrawalFee, uint256 _managementFee)`: Configures various fees associated with the basket.
 *   6. `setOracleProvider(address _oracleAddress)`:  Sets the address of the oracle provider for fetching asset prices.
 *
 * **Asset and Basket Management:**
 *   7. `addAssetToBasket(address _assetAddress, uint256 _initialWeight)`:  Proposes to add a new asset to the basket (requires governance approval).
 *   8. `removeAssetFromBasket(address _assetAddress)`: Proposes to remove an asset from the basket (requires governance approval).
 *   9. `updateAssetWeight(address _assetAddress, uint256 _newWeight)`: Proposes to update the weight of an existing asset (requires governance approval).
 *   10. `rebalanceBasket()`:  Initiates the rebalancing process based on the set strategy.
 *   11. `getBasketComposition()`: Returns the current composition of the asset basket (assets and weights).
 *   12. `getBasketValueInUSD()`: Returns the total value of the basket in USD (using oracle prices).
 *   13. `getAssetWeight(address _assetAddress)`: Returns the current weight of a specific asset in the basket.
 *
 * **User Interaction and Participation:**
 *   14. `deposit(address _assetAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to deposit assets into the basket (contributing to the basket's holdings).
 *   15. `withdraw(uint256 _basketShare)`: Allows users to withdraw their share of the basket in proportion to the current composition.
 *   16. `getBasketShareValue(uint256 _basketShare)`:  Calculates the USD value of a given basket share.
 *   17. `getTotalBasketShares()`: Returns the total number of basket shares issued.
 *   18. `getUserBasketShare(address _user)`: Returns the basket share balance of a specific user.
 *
 * **Governance and Control:**
 *   19. `proposeGovernanceAction(uint8 _actionType, bytes memory _actionParams)`:  Allows governance token holders to propose various actions (e.g., strategy change, fee updates).
 *   20. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on active proposals.
 *   21. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Executes a proposal if it reaches the required quorum and approval.
 *
 * **Utility and Information:**
 *   22. `pauseContract()`: Pauses most contract functionalities (admin only).
 *   23. `unpauseContract()`: Resumes contract functionalities (admin only).
 *   24. `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Dynamic Asset Basket (DDAB):** The core concept is a basket of assets whose composition and weights are not static but can dynamically change based on governance and potentially algorithmic strategies. This is a step beyond simple static portfolios and introduces dynamism.

2.  **Governance-Driven Management:** Key decisions like adding/removing assets, updating weights, changing rebalancing strategies, and adjusting fees are governed by governance token holders. This decentralizes control and allows the community to shape the basket's evolution.

3.  **Rebalancing Strategies (Extensible):** The contract includes a `rebalancingStrategyId` and `rebalancingStrategyParams`. This allows for plugging in different rebalancing algorithms or logic.  While a basic example is provided in `rebalanceBasket()`, this is designed to be extensible. You could implement strategies like:
    *   **Threshold-based:** Rebalance when asset weights deviate from target weights by a certain percentage.
    *   **Periodic:** Rebalance at fixed time intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly).
    *   **Algorithmic/Rule-based:**  Rebalance based on market signals, technical indicators, or other predefined rules (which would need to be implemented externally or within the contract if complexity is manageable).

4.  **Fee Structure:** The contract incorporates deposit, withdrawal, and management fees.  This allows for potential revenue generation for the basket and its governance system (how fees are distributed is not explicitly defined in this example but could be extended).

5.  **User Basket Shares:**  Users receive "basket shares" upon deposit, representing their proportional ownership of the basket. This is similar to shares in a traditional ETF or fund, but decentralized.

6.  **Governance Proposal System:** The `proposeGovernanceAction`, `voteOnProposal`, and `executeProposal` functions create a basic on-chain governance mechanism.  Proposals can be made to alter various aspects of the basket.

7.  **Action Type Enum and Extensibility:** The `ActionType` enum and the `_executeAction` function demonstrate a pattern for handling different types of governance actions.  The inclusion of `CUSTOM_FUNCTION_CALL` hints at potential extensibility to allow governance to trigger more complex or custom logic in the future (though this would require very careful security design).

8.  **Placeholder Oracle Integration:** The `_getAssetPriceFromOracle` function is a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate with a robust decentralized oracle network to fetch real-time asset prices securely.

9.  **Pause/Unpause Functionality:**  Admin-controlled pause and unpause functions provide an emergency brake in case of unforeseen issues or vulnerabilities.

10. **Event Logging:**  Extensive use of events makes the contract auditable and allows external systems to track key actions and changes within the basket.

**Trendy and Creative Aspects:**

*   **DeFi Building Block:** This contract can be seen as a building block for DeFi applications. It provides a decentralized way to manage and interact with a portfolio of crypto assets.
*   **DAO Integration:** The governance features align with the trend of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and community-driven projects.
*   **Dynamic and Algorithmic Finance:**  The concept of dynamic rebalancing and strategy-based management taps into the trend of algorithmic and automated financial strategies within crypto.
*   **Tokenized Basket:**  The basket shares represent a tokenized form of ownership in a diversified portfolio, making it potentially more accessible and liquid than holding individual assets separately.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security is paramount:**  This is a complex contract, and security audits are crucial for any real-world deployment.  Consider reentrancy attacks, oracle manipulation, governance vulnerabilities, and other potential risks.
*   **Oracle Integration:**  The oracle integration is simplified in this example.  A robust and reliable decentralized oracle network (like Chainlink, Band Protocol, etc.) is essential for accurate and secure price feeds in a production system.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For a live contract, gas optimization is important.  Consider efficient data structures, minimizing storage writes, and optimizing function logic to reduce gas costs.
*   **Governance Implementation:** The governance mechanism is basic in this example. Real-world DAOs often use more sophisticated voting systems, delegation, and token locking mechanisms.
*   **Rebalancing Logic:** The `rebalanceBasket` function is a very simplified example. Implementing effective and robust rebalancing strategies requires careful design and testing.
*   **External Interactions (DEX):**  For actual rebalancing, you would likely need to integrate with Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) to execute trades. This adds significant complexity and requires careful consideration of slippage, trading fees, and DEX integration logic.

This contract provides a solid foundation and demonstrates a range of advanced and creative concepts.  You can further expand upon it by implementing more sophisticated rebalancing strategies, enhancing the governance system, integrating with specific oracle providers and DEXs, and adding more features as needed for your specific use case.
