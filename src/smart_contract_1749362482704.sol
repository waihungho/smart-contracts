Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a sophisticated, multi-faceted Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

This DAO, which we'll call `MultiAspectDAO`, will allow members to have varying levels of influence across different "aspects" of the DAO's operations. Voting power will be a dynamic calculation based on a member's influence in the proposal's target aspects and potentially delegated influence. It will support multiple, complex proposal types including external contract calls and internal configuration changes. It also includes features like proposal sponsoring and emergency pause mechanisms.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Members:** Addresses recognized by the DAO.
2.  **Aspects:** Defined areas of governance or operation (e.g., "Treasury Management", "Technical Development", "Community Grants"). Each aspect has a configurable weight and potentially a lead member.
3.  **Aspect Influence:** Each member can have a different influence score within each aspect. This is a core determinant of their voting weight.
4.  **Weighted Voting:** Vote weight on a proposal is calculated dynamically based on the voter's combined influence in the aspects targeted by the proposal, weighted by the importance of those aspects.
5.  **Liquid Democracy:** Members can delegate their voting power (and thus their aspect-based influence calculation) to another member.
6.  **Complex Proposal Types:** Proposals aren't just simple Yes/No votes on a boolean; they encode specific actions, including calling other smart contracts, changing DAO configuration, managing members, or managing aspects.
7.  **Proposal Sponsoring:** Members can "sponsor" a proposal, potentially giving it more visibility or initial consideration.
8.  **Emergency Pause:** A mechanism for the DAO members (via a specific, perhaps high-threshold, proposal type) to temporarily halt certain critical operations.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Functions:**

1.  **Multi-Aspect Influence (`memberAspectInfluence`, `Aspect`, `votingWeight`):**
    *   Members don't just have one level of influence; it varies per aspect.
    *   Aspects have a `votingWeight` multiplier, allowing some areas of governance to be globally more impactful than others.
    *   The `getMemberVoteWeight` function dynamically calculates the vote weight *for a specific proposal* by summing the member's influence in the `targetAspects` of that proposal, each multiplied by the aspect's global `votingWeight`.

2.  **Liquid Democracy with Aspect Awareness (`delegations`, `delegateVote`, `revokeDelegation`, `delegateeTotalInfluence`):**
    *   Standard delegation allows transferring voting *power*.
    *   Here, a member delegates their *aspect influence*. The delegatee's total calculated weight for a proposal includes the sum of their own influence *plus* the influence of everyone who delegated to them, all weighted by the proposal's target aspects.
    *   `delegateeTotalInfluence` is a crucial mapping to efficiently track the *sum* of influence delegated *to* an address for *each aspect*, allowing faster weight calculation without iterating through all delegators each time. This mapping is updated whenever delegation or aspect influence changes.

3.  **Complex, Executable Proposal Types (`ProposalType`, `data`, `executeProposal`, `executeProposalAction`):**
    *   The `data` field is a generic `bytes` payload.
    *   The `ProposalType` enum dictates *how* that `bytes` data is decoded and *which* internal or external action is performed during `executeProposal`.
    *   This makes the DAO highly extensible. It can govern:
        *   Its own configuration (`ConfigChange`).
        *   Its membership (`MemberManagement`).
        *   Its aspects (`AspectManagement`).
        *   Interactions with *any* other smart contract (`ExternalCall`) - this is powerful, allowing the DAO to manage external protocols, upgrade contracts, etc.
        *   Its treasury (`TreasuryWithdrawal`).
        *   Critical state (`EmergencyPause`, `EmergencyUnpause`).
    *   The `executeProposalAction` helper, called via `address(this).call`, is a common pattern to ensure that permission checks in the main `executeProposal` function apply, even though the internal execution logic is separated.

4.  **Proposal Sponsoring (`sponsorProposal`):**
    *   While basic in this implementation (just emits an event), this function introduces the idea that members can signal support or allocate resources (like a small ETH/token stake) to proposals they want to see gain traction or visibility.

5.  **Emergency Pause (`paused`, `emergencyPause`, `emergencyUnpause`):**
    *   Includes a mechanism to halt certain critical operations (`whenNotPaused` modifier).
    *   The pause itself must be triggered by a special proposal type (`EmergencyPause`, `EmergencyUnpause`). In a real-world scenario, these proposal types might have different quorum requirements or voting weights (e.g., requiring a supermajority across all aspects) to prevent malicious or hasty pausing/unpausing. Here, they are standard proposal types for simplicity.

6.  **Modular Internal Actions:**
    *   Functions like `addMember`, `removeMember`, `setMemberAspectInfluence`, `createAspect`, `updateAspect`, `setAspectLead` are written as internal-like helpers. While they have `onlyAdmin` checks for initial setup, they are designed to be called by the `executeProposalAction` function when a relevant proposal passes, making the *DAO* itself the effective "admin" for these operations governed by member votes.

**Function Count Check:**

Let's list the public/external functions and key internal functions that represent distinct callable actions or complex logic:

1.  `constructor`
2.  `addMember` (Callable by admin, but designed for proposal execution)
3.  `removeMember` (Callable by admin, but designed for proposal execution)
4.  `setMemberAspectInfluence` (Callable by admin/lead, but designed for proposal execution)
5.  `createAspect` (Callable by admin, but designed for proposal execution)
6.  `updateAspect` (Callable by admin/lead, but designed for proposal execution)
7.  `setAspectLead` (Callable by admin, but designed for proposal execution)
8.  `delegateVote`
9.  `revokeDelegation`
10. `createProposal`
11. `vote`
12. `sponsorProposal` (Payable)
13. `executeProposal`
14. `cancelProposal`
15. `proposeConfigChange` (Convenience wrapper)
16. `proposeMemberManagement` (Convenience wrapper)
17. `proposeAspectManagement` (Convenience wrapper)
18. `proposeExternalCall` (Convenience wrapper)
19. `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal` (Convenience wrapper)
20. `proposeEmergencyPause` (Convenience wrapper)
21. `proposeEmergencyUnpause` (Convenience wrapper)
22. `receive()` (Payable, implicit function for ETH deposit)
23. `executeProposalAction` (Internal, but represents significant callable logic within the contract)

Adding the essential public view functions that expose complex computed state:
24. `getMemberVoteWeight` (Complex calculation)
25. `getProposalState` (Includes conditional logic based on block number)
26. `getProposalVoteResult` (Returns aggregated complex data)

This easily exceeds the 20+ function requirement, covering setup, core governance loop (create, vote, execute), delegation, specialized actions, treasury, emergency controls, and complex state queries. The implementation details like multi-aspect weighting, liquid democracy tracking (`delegateeTotalInfluence`), and diversified proposal execution make it non-trivial and distinct from basic DAO implementations.
