Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that combines elements of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), simulated AI interactions (via oracles or designated roles), integrated utility/governance token, and staking. We'll call it `DAOAI`.

This contract allows token holders to:
1.  Propose and vote on actions (standard DAO).
2.  Specifically, propose and vote on "AI Work Requests" - tasks for an off-chain AI.
3.  Designate "AI Oracle Providers" who fulfill these requests off-chain.
4.  Evaluate the results submitted by AI Oracles.
5.  Use the treasury to pay approved AI Oracles.
6.  Stake their tokens to earn rewards, potentially tied to successful AI outcomes or proposal execution.
7.  Delegate their voting power (Liquid Democracy).

The token is integrated directly into the contract logic (not a standard ERC-20 inheritance) to make it unique, used for governance weight, staking, and rewards.

## `DAOAI` Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary

**Concept:** A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (`DAOAI`) governing the interaction with and funding of off-chain AI work providers (Oracles). Features integrated token, staking, and liquid democracy.

**Key Components:**
*   **Integrated Token:** Basic token functionality managed within the contract for governance and staking.
*   **Governance:** Proposal creation, voting, execution, cancellation. Includes liquid democracy for vote delegation.
*   **Treasury:** Manages native currency (ETH) and potentially other tokens to fund operations (like paying AI providers).
*   **AI Interaction Layer:** System for requesting AI work, submitting results (by Oracles), evaluating results (by DAO vote), and paying providers.
*   **AI Oracles:** Whitelisted addresses responsible for fulfilling AI requests off-chain.
*   **Staking:** Users can stake tokens to participate more actively and potentially earn rewards.

**Function Summary (Target >= 20):**

**I. Token & Balance Management (Integrated)**

**II. Governance (Proposals, Voting, Execution)**
5.  `propose(bytes memory proposalData, address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory values, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory description)`: Create a new governance proposal.
6.  `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Cast a vote on a proposal.
7.  `execute(uint256 proposalId)`: Execute an approved proposal.
8.  `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancel a proposal (Proposer or Admin).
9.  `delegateVotes(address delegatee)`: Delegate voting power to another address.

18. `evaluateAIResult(uint256 requestId, bool approved)`: DAO members vote/approve the submitted AI result (could be a separate proposal type). *Simplification: Let's make evaluation a separate DAO proposal.* -> This adds more functions.
    *   `proposeAIResultEvaluation(uint256 requestId)`: Create a specific proposal type to evaluate an AI result.
    *   `voteOnAIResultEvaluation(uint256 evaluationProposalId, bool approved)`: Vote on the evaluation proposal.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **DAO Governing AI Interaction:** The core unique concept. The DAO doesn't run AI on-chain (impossible/impractical) but governs the *process* of interacting with off-chain AI via designated oracles, including funding decisions based on perceived value/accuracy of results.
2.  **Integrated Token Logic:** Instead of inheriting a standard ERC20, the basic token `_balances`, `_totalSupply`, `_mint`, `_burn`, `_transfer` logic is handled internally. This allows for custom token mechanics tied directly to DAO/AI/Staking events without relying on standard external calls (except for other tokens in the treasury).
3.  **AI Request Lifecycle:** A defined flow for AI tasks: Proposed (often via DAO proposal) -> Requested -> Submitted (by Oracle) -> Evaluated (via a specific DAO proposal) -> Paid/Rejected.
4.  **AI Oracle Role:** Introduces a specific role (`AIOracle`) managed by the DAO, simulating interaction with external AI providers.
5.  **Evaluation Proposals:** A distinct proposal type specifically for evaluating the quality/suitability of AI results submitted by Oracles. This requires a DAO vote *after* the AI work is done.
6.  **Payment Triggered by Execution:** AI Oracle payments are not automatic upon submission but are executed *only* if the corresponding evaluation proposal passes DAO governance.
7.  **Staking Tied to Activity/Time:** The staking reward calculation is a simple time-based model (`STAKING_REWARD_RATE_PER_BLOCK`) but is designed to be `_updateActivityBlock` triggered. This could be expanded to tie rewards to successful proposal executions, AI result approvals, etc., creating more complex incentive alignment.
8.  **Liquid Democracy (Basic):** The `delegateVotes` function allows users to assign their voting power conceptually. While the `getVotes` implementation here is simplified (returning own balance+stake, implying the delegate calls `vote` on behalf of), the function itself lays the groundwork for more sophisticated liquid democracy models using vote checkpoints (which would add significant complexity and function count).
9.  **Treasury Management via Governance:** Withdrawal of funds (ETH or other tokens) from the contract treasury is strictly controlled and can only happen as part of a successful proposal execution.
10. **Specific Proposal Data Handling:** The `propose` function is designed to accept a generic `proposalData` byte array, allowing for different proposal *types* (like AI Requests) to encode their specific parameters within this data, which is then decoded and acted upon by the contract logic.

This contract structure provides a foundation for a novel DAO where the core purpose revolves around leveraging and compensating external AI capabilities under decentralized governance, using a custom-integrated token for participation and incentives, including staking rewards.
