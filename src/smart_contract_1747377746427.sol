Okay, let's design a smart contract that acts as a "Decentralized Autonomous Syndicate" (DAS). This syndicate will focus on pooling resources, managing projects, and making decisions based on member reputation and influence, rather than just token holdings. It will incorporate concepts like dynamic reputation, influence delegation, and a flexible project lifecycle governed by proposals.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Reputation (Influence):** A non-transferable score earned by members through contributions, successful project participation, and positive actions within the syndicate. This reputation directly translates to voting power and influence.
2.  **Membership:** A governed process for joining and leaving. Members have a status (e.g., Active, Resigned).
3.  **Syndicate Treasury:** A shared pool of funds (primarily ETH for this example, but expandable) managed collectively.
4.  **Projects:** Initiatives proposed, funded, assigned, worked on, and completed (or failed) through the syndicate's governance.
5.  **Proposals:** The central mechanism for decision-making (membership, funding, projects, rule changes, operational actions). Proposals are voted on using reputation weight.
6.  **Influence Delegation:** Members can delegate their voting power (reputation) to other members.
7.  **Configurable Rules:** Key parameters of the syndicate can be changed via governance proposals.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Decisions are based on accrued reputation (`reputation`) rather than static token balances. This incentivizes active participation and positive contributions over simply holding tokens.
2.  **Influence Delegation:** A member can delegate their voting power (reputation) to another. This allows members who are less available to participate in governance indirectly or signal support for delegates they trust.
3.  **Flexible, Generic Proposals (`ProposalType`, `bytes data`):** The `Proposal` struct and `executeProposal` function are designed to handle various types of actions (`ProposalType`). The `bytes data` field allows encoding specific parameters for each action type, making the governance system extensible without changing the core proposal logic. The `executeProposal` function acts as a router, decoding the data and calling internal helper functions (`_onboardNewMember`, `_executeFundAllocation`, etc.). This is a powerful pattern for decentralized upgrades and actions.
4.  **Configurable Rules (`mapping(string => uint256) uintRules`, etc.):** Key parameters like voting periods, quorum percentages, and minimum reputation thresholds are stored in mappings and can be changed via `SyndicateRuleChange` proposals. This allows the syndicate to adapt its own constitution over time through governance, making it more autonomous and resilient.
5.  **Project Lifecycle:** The contract includes states and proposals specifically for managing projects from ideation (`proposeProject`) through execution (`ProjectStatusUpdate`, `AssignProjectLead`, `submitProjectDeliverable`) and potentially completion or failure.
6.  **On-chain Action Execution:** Sensitive actions like transferring funds (`_executeFundAllocation`), updating member status (`_onboardNewMember`), or changing rules (`_changeSyndicateRule`) are gated behind successful governance proposals and executed internally by the `executeProposal` function.
7.  **Decentralized Reputation Management:** Reputation can be explicitly awarded or deducted via `RecordContribution` and `PenalizeMember` proposals, subject to syndicate governance. This moves away from purely algorithmic or off-chain reputation systems.

This contract provides a framework for a highly dynamic and self-governing organization centered around contribution and reputation, offering more complex interactions than standard token-based DAOs. Note that implementing the full complexity of reputation delegation (summing delegated reputation) and ensuring efficient lookups for things like `totalReputationDelegatedTo` and `activeMembersList` in a gas-conscious way requires more advanced data structures or state management patterns than shown in this basic example (e.g., using iterable mappings or separate accumulator variables updated on state changes). The `executeProposal` also needs careful auditing, especially the `OperationalAction` type, to prevent malicious calls if not properly restricted to internal helper functions.
