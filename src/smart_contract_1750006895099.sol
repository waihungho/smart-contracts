Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Property Nexus (DAPN). This contract focuses on the fractional ownership and decentralized management of unique real-world assets (RWAs) represented as NFTs, combining elements of DAOs, fractionalization, reputation, oracles, and dispute resolution.

It avoids duplicating standard ERC20/ERC721 contracts directly by using internal mapping-based accounting for fractions and managing the "master" asset NFT representation within the contract itself, governed by the DAO. It also integrates concepts like stake-based governance, fractional voting, a simple reputation system, and mechanisms for revenue distribution and dispute resolution.

**Decentralized Autonomous Property Nexus (DAPN)**

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Introduction:** Purpose and core concepts.
2.  **Structs:** Data structures for Assets, Proposals, Disputes.
3.  **Enums:** States and types for Proposals and Disputes.
4.  **Events:** To log significant actions.
5.  **State Variables:** Mappings and variables to store contract data (Assets, Fractions, Governance Stakes, Reputation, Proposals, Disputes, Votes, Revenue Claims, Delegates, Roles).
6.  **Roles:** Using OpenZeppelin AccessControl for managing specific privileged actions (Registrar, Oracle, RevenuePusher, Arbiter).
7.  **Modifiers:** Custom modifiers for access control and state checks. (Or inline checks for clarity with many functions).
8.  **Constructor:** Initialize roles.
9.  **Core Logic Functions:**
    *   Asset Registration and Management.
    *   Fractional Ownership (internal accounting).
    *   Governance (Staking, Proposals, Voting, Delegation, Execution).
    *   Revenue Distribution and Claiming.
    *   Reputation System (Internal/Triggered).
    *   Oracle Interactions (Asset Value, Yield).
    *   Dispute Resolution.
    *   Role Management (Inherited).
10. **View Functions:** Read-only functions to query contract state.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor()`: Initializes the contract and grants the default admin role.
*   `grantRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Grants a specific role to an address (requires admin).
*   `revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Revokes a specific role from an address (requires admin).
*   `renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Renounces a role (requires holder).
*   `hasRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Checks if an address has a role (view).
*   `_setupRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Internal function to grant initial roles.
*   `stakeForGovernance(uint256 amount)`: Users stake tokens (e.g., WETH, or a separate protocol token) to gain general governance voting power and reputation.
*   `unstakeFromGovernance(uint256 amount)`: Users withdraw staked tokens.
*   `proposeAction(uint256 assetId, ProposalActionType actionType, bytes calldata proposalData)`: Create a new governance proposal for an asset or the protocol.
*   `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 voteType)`: Vote on an active proposal (For=1, Against=2, Abstain=3). Voting power depends on proposal type (fractional ownership for asset proposals, general stake+reputation for protocol proposals).
*   `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Execute a proposal that has passed and is within its execution window.
*   `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Delegate general governance voting power to another address.
*   `claimRevenue(uint256 assetId)`: Users claim their accumulated revenue share for a specific asset based on fractional ownership.
*   `raiseDispute(uint256 assetId, uint256 relatedProposalId, string memory description, uint256 bondAmount)`: Users stake a bond to raise a dispute related to an asset or a proposal.
*   `voteOnDispute(uint256 disputeId, uint8 voteType)`: Arbiters vote on a dispute (ForRaiser=1, AgainstRaiser=2).
*   `resolveDispute(uint256 disputeId)`: Execute the outcome of a dispute vote, potentially slashing bonds or triggering actions.
*   `registerNewAsset(string memory uri, uint256 initialFractionSupply)`: (Requires REGISTRAR_ROLE) Registers a new real-world asset representation as an internal NFT and defines its initial fractional supply.
*   `mintAssetFractions(uint256 assetId, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: (Internal/Callable by specific logic or Role) Mints fractional tokens for an asset.
*   `burnAssetFractions(uint256 assetId, address account, uint256 amount)`: (Internal/Callable by specific logic) Burns fractional tokens.
*   `transferFractions(uint256 assetId, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer internal fractional tokens for a specific asset. Mimics ERC20 transfer.
*   `distributeRevenue(uint256 assetId, uint256 amount)`: (Requires REVENUE_PUSHER_ROLE) Distributes revenue proportionally to current fraction holders of an asset.
*   `updateAssetValue(uint256 assetId, uint256 newValue)`: (Requires ORACLE_ROLE) Updates the estimated value of an asset based on oracle data.
*   `updateRentalYield(uint256 assetId, uint256 newYield)`: (Requires ORACLE_ROLE) Updates the estimated rental yield of an asset based on oracle data.
*   `_calculateVotingPower(address _voter, uint256 _assetId, bool useFractionalPower)`: Internal helper to calculate voting power based on fractions or stake+reputation.
*   `_updateReputationScore(address account, int256 scoreChange)`: Internal helper to adjust reputation based on actions.
*   `balanceOfFractions(uint256 assetId, address account)`: Get the fraction balance for an account and asset (view).

*   `getDisputeDetails(uint256 disputeId)`: Get details about a dispute (view).
*   `getStakeAmount(address account)`: Get the governance stake of an account (view).
*   `getRevenueClaimable(uint256 assetId, address account)`: Get the claimable revenue for an account and asset (view).
*   `getReputationScore(address account)`: Get the reputation score of an account (view).
*   `getDelegatee(address account)`: Get the delegatee of an account for general governance (view).
*   `getProposalVoteCount(uint256 proposalId)`: Get current vote counts for a proposal (view).
*   `getDisputeVoteCount(uint256 disputeId)`: Get current vote counts for a dispute (view).
