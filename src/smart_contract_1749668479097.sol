Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced and creative concepts beyond typical open-source patterns. We'll create an `OmniFund` contract â€“ a decentralized, participant-governed fund with dynamic features, reputation mechanics, non-transferable participation units, and flexible distribution rules.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Non-Transferable Participation:** Participants don't hold fungible tokens representing shares. Instead, they earn non-transferable "Participation Units" and "Reputation Points". This encourages long-term commitment and prevents speculative trading of fund shares.
2.  **Dynamic Funding Rounds:** The fund can operate in distinct funding rounds, each with configurable rules (min/max contribution, duration).
3.  **Weighted Governance:** Voting power on investment proposals or fund parameters is a combination of a participant's Participation Units and Reputation Points, allowing reputation (earned through contributions, activity, or admin grants) to influence decisions.
4.  **Flexible Distribution Logic:** Profits or distributed assets are allocated based on a configurable formula combining Participation Units, Reputation Points, and potentially time-based factors or vesting schedules (simulated).
5.  **Timed Withdrawal/Leaving:** Participants cannot instantly cash out. Initiating a withdrawal may subject their claimable amount to a vesting period or penalty, encouraging stability.
6.  **Asset Agnostic (ERC-20):** Can hold and distribute various ERC-20 tokens.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

**Contract: OmniFund**

A decentralized, dynamic investment fund managing multiple ERC-20 assets. Participation is non-transferable, based on earned units and reputation. Governance and distribution are weighted by these factors.

**State Variables:**

*   `owner`: Address of the contract owner.
*   `admins`: Mapping of addresses to boolean, indicating administrator status. Admins have elevated control over parameters and emergency actions.
*   `paused`: Boolean indicating if the contract is paused (emergency state).
*   `allowedAssets`: Mapping of ERC20 token addresses to boolean, indicating which tokens are accepted for contribution and distribution.
*   `participants`: Mapping of participant addresses to `Participant` structs. Stores individual participant data (units, reputation, withdrawal status, claimed amounts).
*   `totalParticipationUnits`: Total units ever issued across all participants.
*   `totalReputationPoints`: Total reputation points across all participants.
*   `fundBalances`: Mapping of ERC20 token addresses to the contract's balance of that token.
*   `currentRound`: Stores the state of the active funding round.
*   `nextRoundConfig`: Stores the configuration for the *next* funding round, set by admins.
*   `proposalCounter`: Counter for unique investment proposal IDs.
*   `proposals`: Mapping of proposal IDs to `InvestmentProposal` structs. Stores details and voting results for governance proposals.
*   `distributionParameters`: Stores the weights and rules currently used for calculating asset distributions.
*   `participantClaimedAmounts`: Mapping of participant address -> token address -> amount claimed. Tracks how much each participant has already claimed for each token.

**Structs:**

*   `Participant`: Details for each participant (units, reputation, join round, withdrawal initiation time, cancelled withdrawal count).
*   `FundingRoundConfig`: Configuration for a funding round (start time, end time, min/max contribution, target amount, unit issuance rate).
*   `FundingRoundState`: State of the current funding round (round number, config, total raised).
*   `InvestmentProposal`: Details for a proposal (proposer, target asset, amount, description, voting end time, state, votes for/against).
*   `DistributionParameters`: Weights for calculating distribution shares (e.g., how much units vs reputation influence payout).

**Events:**

*   `AdminAdded`, `AdminRemoved`, `AdminRoleTransferred`
*   `Paused`, `Unpaused`
*   `AllowedAssetSet`

*   `whenNotPaused`: Function can only be called when the contract is not paused.
*   `whenPaused`: Function can only be called when the contract is paused.
*   `onlyParticipant`: Only registered participants can call.
*   `isActiveRound`: Function requires an active funding round.
*   `isProposalActive`: Function requires the proposal to be in the voting phase.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Implementation:**

1.  **Non-Transferable Participation Units & Reputation:**
    *   The `Participant` struct stores `participationUnits` and `reputationPoints`.
    *   These are incremented/decremented via specific internal or admin functions (`contribute`, `addReputation`, `slashReputation`, `burnUnits`).
    *   There are no functions for `transferUnits` or `transferReputation`, making them soulbound to the participant's address within this contract.

2.  **Dynamic Funding Rounds:**
    *   `FundingRoundConfig` and `FundingRoundState` structs manage round parameters and state.
    *   `configureFundingRound` allows admins to set the rules for the *next* round.
    *   `startFundingRound` activates the configured round.
    *   `endFundingRound` manually ends the current round.
    *   `contribute` is restricted to be called only during an `isActiveRound` and checks round-specific min/max contribution and target asset.

3.  **Weighted Governance:**
    *   `voteOnProposal` calculates voting power using `(participants[voter].participationUnits * distributionParameters.unitWeight) + (participants[voter].reputationPoints * distributionParameters.reputationWeight)`.
    *   Votes are tallied separately for units and reputation, allowing the `distributionParameters` to control the weight of each.
    *   Delegation (`delegateVotingPower`, `revokeVotingPower`) allows participants to assign their combined voting power to another address.
    *   `_updateProposalState` calculates the outcome based on these weighted votes.

4.  **Flexible Distribution Logic:**
    *   `DistributionParameters` stores `unitWeight` and `reputationWeight`.
    *   `calculateClaimableAssets` computes a participant's share based on `(participantBasis / totalCurrentBasis) * totalDistributedEarnings`.
    *   `totalCurrentBasis` is a simplified calculation based on *global* totals (`totalParticipationUnits`, `totalReputationPoints`). A more robust system would need more complex tracking of total basis that contributed to specific earning events.
    *   `updateDistributionParameters` allows admins to change the weights, influencing future claims.
    *   `totalDistributedEarnings` tracks total funds received for a token, acting as the pool for distribution.
    *   `participantClaimedAmounts` prevents claiming more than calculated.

5.  **Timed Withdrawal/Leaving:**
    *   `initiateParticipantWithdrawal` records a timestamp.
    *   `cancelParticipantWithdrawal` resets the timestamp and increments a counter (could be used for penalties in a more complex version).
    *   `calculateClaimableAssets` checks `withdrawalInitiatedTime` and `distributionParameters.withdrawalVestingPeriod` to reduce the claimable amount if the vesting period hasn't passed.

6.  **Asset Agnostic (ERC-20):**
    *   `allowedAssets` mapping controls which tokens are permitted.
    *   `fundBalances` tracks balances for each token.
    *   Functions like `contribute`, `setAllowedAsset`, `receiveInvestmentReturns`, `executeInvestmentProposal`, `calculateClaimableAssets`, and `claimAssets` take a token address as a parameter, allowing interaction with different ERC-20s.

**Key Considerations and Potential Improvements:**

*   **Efficiency:** Iterating through all participants or tracking global basis on-chain for perfect distribution calculation (`calculateClaimableAssets`) is highly inefficient and costly. A production system would likely use off-chain computation and on-chain proofs, or a more sophisticated on-chain snapshotting mechanism. The current `calculateClaimableAssets` is simplified for demonstration.
*   **Quorum:** The current proposal voting lacks a quorum mechanism (minimum number of votes cast for a proposal to be valid). This is a standard DAO feature that could be added.
*   **Proposal Execution:** The `executeInvestmentProposal` currently transfers funds to the *proposer*. In a real investment scenario, it should interact with another investment contract or protocol.
*   **Error Handling/Edge Cases:** More robust checks could be added (e.g., what happens if `unitIssuanceRate` results in 0 units for a contribution?).
*   **Admin Power:** Admins have significant power (pause, change distribution rules, add/slash reputation, burn units). A real-world DAO might decentralize some of these powers via further governance votes.
*   **Complexity:** This contract is already quite complex. Adding features like NFT-based badges, multiple simultaneous funding rounds, or more intricate vesting schedules would increase complexity significantly.
*   **External Calls:** Interacting with `IERC20` involves external calls. While common, reentrancy guards (`nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin) would be crucial if `claimAssets` or `executeInvestmentProposal` involved sending tokens and then immediately calling back into the contract. In this design, tokens are sent *out* at the end, reducing reentrancy risk, but it's good practice to be mindful.

This contract provides a solid framework demonstrating how multiple advanced concepts can be combined into a unique decentralized application logic, going beyond simple token transfers or standard governance models.
