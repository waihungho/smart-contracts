/**
 * @title Decentralized Social Reputation & Task Management (DSRTM)
 * @author Bard (AI Assisted)
 * @notice A novel smart contract leveraging dynamic reputation scoring and decentralized task assignments, incorporating advanced concepts like verifiable random functions (VRFs) for fairness and tokenized reputation rewards.
 *
 * @dev This contract aims to build a decentralized platform for social reputation and task management. Users earn reputation and tokens by completing tasks and maintaining positive community standing.
 *  Key Features:
 *      - Dynamic Reputation: Reputation scores change based on task performance, community votes, and other factors.
 *      - Decentralized Tasks:  Users can create, bid on, and complete tasks, fostering collaboration.
 *      - VRF-Based Task Assignment:  Utilizes Chainlink VRF to randomly assign tasks to qualified bidders, promoting fairness.
 *      - Reputation-Based Rewards: Task creators can set rewards that increase based on the reputation of the task completer.
 *      - Community Governance:  A simple governance mechanism for adjusting contract parameters and resolving disputes.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *      - Structures & Enums: Define data structures for users, tasks, bids, and reputation events.
 *      - State Variables:  Store user data, task data, reputation information, and contract parameters.
 *      - Modifiers:  Implement access control and data validation modifiers.
 *      - Functions:
 *          - registerUser(): Registers a new user.
 *          - createTask(): Creates a new task with specific requirements and rewards.
 *          - bidOnTask(): Allows users to bid on tasks, submitting a proposed solution.
 *          - fulfillTask():  Allows a task creator to mark a task as fulfilled and reward the completer.
 *          - voteOnSolution(): Allows community members to vote on the quality of a task solution.
 *          - updateReputation():  Updates a user's reputation score based on various factors.
 *          - withdrawRewards(): Allows users to withdraw earned tokens.
 *          - requestRandomWords(): Requests random words from Chainlink VRF for task assignment.
 *          - fulfillRandomWords(): Callback function to fulfill the VRF request.
 *          - proposeParameterChange(): Allows users to propose changes to contract parameters.
 *          - voteOnProposal(): Allows users to vote on proposed parameter changes.

Key improvements and advanced concepts in this contract:

*   **Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) for Fair Task Assignment:**  Uses Chainlink VRF to introduce verifiable randomness in the task assignment process.  This ensures a fair and unbiased selection of a qualified bidder.  This is a significant advancement beyond simple first-come, first-served or reputation-based assignment, especially crucial for high-value or contentious tasks.  The VRF usage includes all necessary components:  request, callback (fulfillRandomWords), and request ID mapping.
*   **Dynamic Reputation-Based Rewards:**  Task rewards are not fixed but scale based on the reputation of the task completer. This incentivizes users to build and maintain a high reputation, as it directly translates to higher earning potential.
*   **ERC20 Token Integration:** Rewards are distributed in the form of an ERC20 token managed within the contract.  This allows for a more flexible and potentially tradeable reward system than simple ETH transfers.
*   **Decentralized Governance:**  Includes a rudimentary governance mechanism that allows the community to propose and vote on changes to contract parameters (e.g., reputation gains/losses, reward multipliers, voting durations).
*   **Detailed Events:** Emits detailed events for every significant action, providing a transparent and auditable record of activity on the platform.
*   **Bid System:** Implements a bidding system, where multiple users can propose solutions and a bid amount, adding a layer of competition and allowing for better task completion quality.
*   **Reputation decay mitigation:**  The `voteOnSolution` function prevents reputation scores from dropping below zero.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Carefully considers gas costs, particularly within the VRF fulfillment callback.  Mappings are cleaned up after use.
*   **Clear Error Messages:** Uses descriptive error messages in `require` statements to aid in debugging and user understanding.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Includes thorough NatSpec documentation for all functions and variables, explaining their purpose and usage.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a decentralized social reputation and task management platform, incorporating several advanced concepts to ensure fairness, incentivization, and community governance.  It also shows a creative use of a VRF not just for randomness, but to enable the core functionality (fair task distribution). Remember this contract utilizes Chainlink VRF and requires setting up a Chainlink subscription, funding it, and configuring the contract parameters appropriately.  The governance component is simplified and would likely require further development in a real-world deployment (e.g., quadratic voting, timelocks).
