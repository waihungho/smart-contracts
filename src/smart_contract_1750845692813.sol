Okay, here is a smart contract concept for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Guild (DAAG). This contract combines elements of NFTs (for membership), DAO governance (proposals, voting), treasury management, dynamic traits, curation, and a nod towards generative art/IP management.

It aims for complexity and non-standard functions by integrating these ideas:

1.  **NFT Membership (Guild Passes):**ERC721 tokens represent membership.
2.  **Dynamic Traits:** Guild Pass traits can evolve based on member activity and reputation.
3.  **Staking for Governance Power:** Members can stake their Guild Pass NFTs to boost their voting power.
4.  **Multi-faceted Governance:** Voting on funding proposals, configuration changes, *and* art curation.
5.  **Treasury Management:** For funding approved projects.
6.  **Reputation System:** Internal score tracking member contributions.
7.  **Curation Mechanism:** Guild members collectively decide which submitted artworks are featured.
8.  **Generative Art Registry:** A way for members to register generative art models.

// --- FUNCTION SUMMARY ---

// --- Guild Pass (ERC721) ---
// 1. constructor(): Initializes contract, deploys ERC721.
// 2. mintGuildPass(string memory tokenURI_): Mints a new Guild Pass NFT to the caller after payment. Sets initial traits.
// 3. burnGuildPass(uint256 tokenId): Burns a Guild Pass NFT, revoking membership. Requires unstaking first if staked.
// 4. updateGuildPassTraits(uint256 tokenId): Internal/triggered function to recalculate and update a Guild Pass NFT's dynamic traits based on activity/reputation.
// 5. tokenURI(uint256 tokenId): ERC721 standard. Returns URI including dynamic traits.
// 6. getGuildPassDetails(uint256 tokenId): View. Returns the custom GuildPassTraits struct for a token.

// --- Treasury ---
// 7. depositTreasury(): Payable function to receive Ether into the guild treasury.
// 8. getTreasuryBalance(): View. Returns the current Ether balance of the contract.

// --- Proposals & Governance ---
// 9. submitFundingProposal(uint256 amount, string memory description, uint64 votingPeriodEnds): Submits a proposal to withdraw funds from the treasury for a project.
// 10. submitConfigurationProposal(string memory description, bytes memory calldata): Submits a proposal to change contract configuration (requires execution logic for the calldata).
// 11. voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support): Casts a vote (yes/no) on an open proposal. Voting power based on staking + reputation.
// 12. executeProposal(uint256 proposalId): Executes a proposal if the voting period is over and the threshold/quorum is met.
// 13. getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId): View. Returns details of a specific proposal.
// 14. getVoteStatus(uint256 proposalId, address voter): View. Checks if a specific address has voted on a proposal.
// 15. delegateVotingPower(address delegatee): Delegates voting power to another address.
// 16. getVotingDelegatee(address delegator): View. Returns the address the delegator has delegated to.
// 17. getVotingPower(address account): View. Calculates the current effective voting power of an address.

// --- Reputation System ---
// 18. updateMemberReputation(address member): Internal/triggered function to recalculate and update a member's reputation score based on their activity (voting on successful proposals, submitting successful proposals, staking duration).
// 19. getMemberReputation(address member): View. Returns the reputation score of an address.

// --- Art Curation ---
// 20. submitArtworkForCuration(string memory artworkURI, string memory description): Submits an artwork reference for guild curation voting.
// 21. voteOnArtworkCuration(uint256 submissionId, bool support): Casts a vote (yes/no) on an artwork curation submission.
// 22. featureCuratedArtwork(uint256 submissionId): Marks an artwork submission as 'featured' if it passes curation voting thresholds.
// 23. getArtworkSubmissionDetails(uint256 submissionId): View. Returns details of an artwork submission.

// --- Generative Art & IP ---

// 25. getGenerativeModelDetails(uint256 modelId): View. Returns details of a registered generative model.
// 26. distributeRevenueShare(uint256 amount, uint256 modelId): Placeholder for distributing potential revenue earned *via* a registered model back to relevant parties (complex, depends on off-chain agreements/logic, but included as a concept).

// --- Staking ---
// 27. stakeGuildPassForVotingBoost(uint256 tokenId): Stakes a Guild Pass NFT, increasing the owner's voting power. Token is held by the contract.
// 28. unstakeGuildPass(uint256 tokenId): Unstakes a Guild Pass NFT. Token is returned to the owner.
// 29. isPassStaked(uint256 tokenId): View. Checks if a specific Guild Pass is currently staked.
// 30. getTotalStakedPasses(): View. Returns the total count of staked passes.

// --- Configuration & Utility ---
// 31. signalIntentToParticipate(): Simple function for members to signal activity, potentially boosting future reputation calculation.
// 32. updateMemberProfileURI(string memory profileURI): Allows a member to link an off-chain profile/portfolio URI to their address.
// 33. getMemberProfileURI(address member): View. Returns the profile URI for an address.
// 34. setGuildURI(string memory guildURI_): Owner/Governance sets a metadata URI for the guild itself.

        // This requires a way to get all tokens owned by effectiveAccount efficiently (e.g., via an index, which is not standard ERC721).
        // Alternative simpler approach: Sum up the `reputation` and `participationScore` of ALL passes owned and staked by the effectiveAccount.
        // This is still hard without an index.

        // Power = (Count of *staked* passes owned by effectiveAccount) * STAKING_BOOST + Reputation Score.
        // STAKING_BOOST is some multiplier.
        // This requires iterating through all staked passes to see which ones belong to the effectiveAccount. Inefficient for large numbers.

        // Power = BasePower (e.g., 1 per member) + PowerFromStakedPasses (e.g., 1 per staked pass owned by the original account, not delegatee) + ReputationBonus.
        // This is still flawed with delegation.

        // Let's use a different model:
        // An account's power is the SUM of power from all *their own* Guild Passes.
        // A pass's power is 1 + (if staked, some boost) + (some function of its traits/reputation).
        // When delegated, the delegatee gets the sum of power from their own passes PLUS the sum of power from all passes delegated to them.

        // Simplified Model for this contract: Voting power comes from:
        // 1. A base amount per *unstaked* pass owned by the account.
        // 2. A higher amount per *staked* pass owned by the account.
        // 3. A bonus based on the account's overall reputation.
        // Delegation sums up the power of delegated passes to the delegatee.

        // Need a list/mapping of tokens owned by an address for efficiency... ERC721 doesn't provide this standardly.
        // We'll have to loop through all minted tokens and check ownership/staking status. INEFFICIENT on chain!
        // This is a common limitation addressed by off-chain indexing or ERC721 extensions.

        // For demonstration, let's just use Reputation as the SOLE determinant of voting power, updated based on staked passes.
        // This makes getVotingPower efficient and pushes complexity into updateMemberReputation.
        // Simplified power = Reputation Score + (Count of *staked* passes owned by effectiveAccount * STAKE_REP_BONUS)
        // Still needs iteration or index for staked passes owned by the effective account.

        // Okay, simplest feasible on-chain model without iterating tokens or requiring indexes:
        // Voting Power = Reputation Score of the EFFECTIVE account (delegatee)
        // Reputation is updated by:
        // 1. Staking a pass (gives a boost to reputation calculation).
        // 2. Participation signals.
        // 3. (Ideally) Voting on successful proposals, submitting successful proposals.

        // So, let's make Voting Power = _memberReputation[effectiveAccount].
        // And `updateMemberReputation` needs to factor in staked passes.

        // Recalculate reputation just-in-time? No, too slow.
        // Rely on `updateMemberReputation` being called periodically or by trigger.

        // Final Simplified Voting Power:
        // If account has delegated, power = _memberReputation[delegatee]

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic NFT Traits (`updateGuildPassTraits`, `tokenURI`)**: The `GuildPassTraits` struct holds on-chain data (reputation, participation, staking status). The `updateGuildPassTraits` function is designed to modify these based on activity. The `tokenURI` function is overridden to include this on-chain data, allowing off-chain platforms (like marketplaces or the guild's frontend) to display dynamic metadata reflecting the member's engagement. *This goes beyond static metadata common in many NFTs.*
2.  **NFT Staking for Governance Power (`stakeGuildPassForVotingBoost`, `unstakeGuildPass`, `getVotingPower`)**: Members lock their membership NFTs in the contract (`stakeGuildPassForVotingBoost`). While staked, the NFT owner changes to the contract, but the contract tracks the original staker. The `getVotingPower` function calculates voting weight based on the staker's reputation score, which is boosted by having passes staked. *This links NFT ownership and locking to governance participation in a dynamic way.*
3.  **Reputation System (`updateMemberReputation`, `getMemberReputation`, `signalIntentToParticipate`)**: An internal score (`_memberReputation`) tracks member standing. While simplified in the code (mainly boosted by staking and signaling), a real system would tie this to successful votes, proposals, curation efforts, etc. `signalIntentToParticipate` is a simple mechanism for members to proactively boost their activity score, influencing reputation. *This moves beyond simple 1-token-1-vote or 1-NFT-1-vote towards a more nuanced influence model.*
4.  **Multi-Type Governance (`submitFundingProposal`, `submitConfigurationProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, `executeProposal`)**: The DAO can vote on different types of proposals (funding, configuration changes). The `executeProposal` function includes logic to handle these different types, including potentially executing arbitrary `calldata` for config changes (with significant security implications needing careful design in production). *This allows the DAO to govern various aspects of the guild, not just treasury.*
5.  **Art Curation Mechanism (`submitArtworkForCuration`, `voteOnArtworkCuration`, `featureCuratedArtwork`)**: A separate voting mechanism for artwork submissions allows the community to collectively decide which pieces are endorsed or featured by the guild, decoupled from treasury spending proposals. *This is a creative use of a DAO structure specifically for cultural/artistic decisions.*
6.  **Generative Art Registry (`registerGenerativeModel`, `distributeRevenueShare`)**: Provides a way to formally register generative models within the guild's context. The `distributeRevenueShare` function is a conceptual placeholder acknowledging the complex IP/revenue models associated with generative art outputs, suggesting the guild could potentially manage or facilitate this via governance or off-chain coordination. *This incorporates a trendy area of art/tech into the guild's potential scope.*
7.  **Voting Power Delegation (`delegateVotingPower`, `getVotingDelegatee`, `getVotingPower`)**: Standard DAO concept, but integrated with the reputation-based voting power calculation. *Allows members who are less available to participate directly to still have their influence represented.*
8.  **Member Profile Linking (`updateMemberProfileURI`, `getMemberProfileURI`)**: Allows members to link off-chain identities or portfolios, fostering a sense of community and discoverability within the guild context, stored immutably on-chain. *A simple, but useful social/utility feature.*

This contract is a conceptual framework. A production system would require more robust handling of the `calldata` execution in configuration proposals, more gas-efficient methods for iterating tokens (requiring ERC721 extensions or off-chain indexing), a more sophisticated reputation calculation logic, and potentially a separate governance or timelock contract for security-critical operations. The `distributeRevenueShare` would need a clearly defined trigger and mechanism.

It meets the requirement of having more than 20 functions and introduces several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts relevant to the current blockchain space focusing on NFTs, DAOs, and digital art.
