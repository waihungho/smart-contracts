Okay, let's design a creative and advanced smart contract concept that isn't a direct copy of common open-source protocols.

We'll create a `QuantumFluxVault` - a vault that holds assets but has dynamic rules, release conditions based on external data and an internal "flux score" (reputation/trust), and advanced features like delegated access and a pseudo-atomic "flash execution" within the vault's context. It incorporates ideas of dynamic state, conditional logic, and oracle interaction without building a full DeFi primitive like an AMM or lending protocol.

It's important to note that "Quantum" and "Flux" here are metaphorical, representing complex, potentially non-linear, and dynamic state changes influenced by various factors, rather than actual quantum computing principles.

**QuantumFluxVault: Outline and Function Summary**

**Concept:** A dynamic asset vault (`ETH` and `ERC20`) where withdrawal conditions, fees, and state (`VaultState`) change based on time, oracle data, and a user's internal "flux score". It includes features like conditional release based on external triggers, delegated withdrawal rights, and a limited form of atomic "flash" execution within the vault.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Dynamic State (`VaultState`):** The vault can be in different states (e.g., Normal, Restricted, HighFlux) affecting deposit/withdrawal rules and fees. State updates are triggered by external data or time.
2.  **Flux Score:** An internal, non-transferable score assigned to users, affecting their withdrawal requirements and potential fees. Can be adjusted based on interactions or admin decisions.
3.  **Conditional Withdrawals:** Withdrawals require meeting multiple criteria: sufficient flux score, correct vault state, potentially elapsed time, and confirmation from an oracle or external trigger.
4.  **Dynamic Fees:** Deposit/withdrawal fees vary based on the current `VaultState` or other configurable parameters.
5.  **Oracle Integration:** Relies on oracle data (simulated via external calls) to potentially trigger state changes or verify withdrawal conditions.
6.  **Delegated Access:** Users can delegate the right to *execute* a withdrawal on their behalf (but not request it) to another address.
7.  **Flash Execution Tunnel:** Allows a user to propose a sequence of actions *within* the vault (e.g., transfer between their own sub-balances, update internal state if conditions met) that must succeed atomically, or the entire transaction reverts. Not a capital-based flash loan, but a state-based atomic execution.
8.  **Supported Assets:** Configurable list of supported ERC20 tokens alongside native ETH.

**Outline:**
1.  **License & Imports**
2.  **Interfaces** (`IERC20`, `IOracle`)
3.  **Errors**
4.  **Enums** (`VaultState`, `ConditionType`)
5.  **Structs** (`AssetConfig`, `UserDeposit`, `WithdrawalRequest`, `DelegatedPermission`)
6.  **State Variables**
7.  **Events**
8.  **Modifiers**
9.  **Functions:**
    *   Constructor
    *   Admin/Configuration (Pause, Setters for parameters, Add/Remove assets, Set Oracle)
    *   Deposit (ETH, ERC20)
    *   Withdrawal (Request, Execute, Cancel Request)
    *   State Management (Update State, Trigger Updates)
    *   Flux Score Management (Adjust Score, Get Score)
    *   Delegated Access (Grant, Revoke, Execute)
    *   Flash Execution Tunnel
    *   Information Retrieval (Get Balances, User Details, Config)
    *   Helper/Internal Functions (Check Conditions, Calculate Fee)
    *   Emergency Functions

**Function Summary (External/Public Functions):**

1.  `constructor(address payable initialOwner, address[] supportedTokens, address priceOracle, address customConditionOracle)`: Initializes the vault with owner, initial supported tokens, and oracle addresses.
2.  `pause()`: Pauses the contract, preventing most operations (Owner only).
3.  `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract (Owner only).
4.  `addSupportedAsset(address assetAddress, bool isERC20)`: Adds a new asset (ETH or ERC20) that can be deposited/withdrawn (Owner only).
5.  `removeSupportedAsset(address assetAddress)`: Removes a supported asset (Owner only). Requires asset balance to be zero.
6.  `setFluxParameters(uint256 minFluxScore, uint256 highFluxThreshold, uint256 normalFeeRate, uint256 restrictedFeeRate, uint256 highFluxFeeRate)`: Sets parameters for flux score thresholds and dynamic fees (Owner only).
7.  `setOracleAddress(address priceOracle, address customConditionOracle)`: Updates the addresses of the configured oracles (Owner only).
8.  `deposit(address assetAddress)`: Deposits `msg.value` (if assetAddress is zero/ETH) or `ERC20` tokens (requires prior approval) into the vault. Updates user's deposit record and potentially flux score.
9.  `requestConditionalWithdrawal(address assetAddress, uint256 amount, ConditionType conditionType, bytes conditionData)`: Initiates a withdrawal request for a specific asset and amount, specifying the type of external condition needed for execution.
10. `cancelWithdrawalRequest(address assetAddress)`: Cancels a pending withdrawal request for a specific asset.
11. `executeConditionalWithdrawal(address user, address assetAddress)`: Attempts to finalize a withdrawal request for `user` and `assetAddress`. Checks if all conditions (flux score, state, time, oracle data) are met. Only callable if a request exists and conditions pass. Pays dynamic fee.
12. `triggerFluxStateUpdate()`: Callable by anyone (or a Keeper bot) to attempt to update the `VaultState` based on current time and oracle data. Uses cached oracle data if fresh data isn't needed/available.
13. `adjustFluxScore(address user, int256 scoreDelta)`: Adjusts a user's flux score by a signed delta (Admin/Owner only, or potentially via internal logic in future versions).
14. `delegateAccessPermission(address delegatee, address assetAddress, uint48 expirationTimestamp)`: Grants `delegatee` the right to execute a withdrawal request for `msg.sender` for a specific asset, up to a certain time.
15. `revokeAccessPermission(address delegatee, address assetAddress)`: Revokes a previously granted delegation.
16. `executeDelegatedAction(address delegator, address delegatee, bytes data)`: Allows `delegatee` to execute a pre-defined action (currently only `executeConditionalWithdrawal`) on behalf of `delegator`, provided delegation exists and conditions are met. `data` likely encodes the asset address and potentially proof data.
17. `flashExecutionTunnel(bytes actionsData)`: Executes a sequence of internal vault actions defined by `actionsData` atomically. If any action fails, the entire transaction reverts. *Note: This requires careful implementation and definition of internal actions.*
18. `getVaultState()`: Returns the current operational state of the vault.
19. `getUserFluxScore(address user)`: Returns the current flux score of a user.
20. `getAssetBalance(address assetAddress)`: Returns the total balance of a specific asset held by the vault.
21. `getUserDepositAmount(address user, address assetAddress)`: Returns the amount of a specific asset a user has deposited.
22. `getWithdrawalRequest(address user, address assetAddress)`: Returns details of a user's pending withdrawal request for an asset.
23. `getDelegatedPermission(address delegator, address delegatee, address assetAddress)`: Returns details of a specific delegated permission.
24. `getSupportedAssets()`: Returns the list of addresses of all supported assets.
25. `getAssetConfig(address assetAddress)`: Returns configuration details for a supported asset.
26. `getCurrentDynamicFee(address assetAddress)`: Returns the current fee rate (%) for operations on a specific asset based on the current `VaultState`. *Note: This might be internal or public view depending on complexity.* Let's make it public view.
27. `checkCurrentWithdrawalConditions(address user, address assetAddress)`: Public view function to check if the conditions for a pending withdrawal request are *currently* met, without executing the withdrawal. (Useful for frontends).

This gives us 27 functions, well over the required 20, covering a range of standard and advanced concepts.
