 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAArt Gallery)
 * @author Bard (Generated AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like dynamic pricing,
 *      artist reputation, curated exhibitions, community voting, and decentralized governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Artist Management:**
 *    - `applyForArtist()`: Artists can apply to be part of the gallery.
 *    - `approveArtistApplication(address _artist)`: Gallery owner/curators can approve artist applications.
 *    - `revokeArtistStatus(address _artist)`: Gallery owner/curators can revoke artist status.
 *    - `isApprovedArtist(address _artist)`: Check if an address is an approved artist.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Management:**
 *    - `createArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Artists can create and list their artwork.
 *    - `updateArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Artists can update the price of their artwork.
 *    - `delistArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists can delist their artwork from the gallery.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieve details of a specific artwork.
 *    - `getAllArtworks()`: Get a list of all artworks currently listed in the gallery.
 *    - `getArtistArtworks(address _artist)`: Get a list of artworks created by a specific artist.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic Pricing & Reputation:**
 *    - `viewArtworkPopularity(uint256 _artworkId)`: View a calculated popularity score for an artwork (based on views, likes, etc.).
 *    - `likeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Users can like artworks, influencing popularity and potentially pricing.
 *    - `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reason)`: Users can report artworks for policy violations.
 *    - `adjustPriceBasedOnPopularity(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal/Automated) Adjust artwork price based on popularity metrics.
 *    - `getArtistReputation(address _artist)`: Retrieve an artist's reputation score (based on sales, community feedback, etc.).
 *
 * **4. Curated Exhibitions:**
 *    - `proposeExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256[] memory _artworkIds)`: Curators can propose exhibitions.
 *    - `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Gallery members can vote on exhibition proposals.
 *    - `finalizeExhibition(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gallery owner/curators can finalize an exhibition after successful voting.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Get a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Get details of a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **5. Sales and Transactions:**
 *    - `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Users can buy artworks listed in the gallery.
 *    - `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their earnings from sales.
 *    - `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Gallery owner can set the gallery fee percentage.
 *    - `getGalleryBalance()`: View the gallery's accumulated fees.
 *    - `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Gallery owner can withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 *
 * **6. Decentralized Governance & Community:**
 *    - `proposeGalleryPolicyChange(string memory _policyProposal)`: Community members can propose changes to gallery policies.
 *    - `voteOnPolicyChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Gallery members can vote on policy change proposals.
 *    - `finalizePolicyChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gallery owner/curators can finalize policy changes after successful voting.
 *    - `setCurator(address _curator, bool _isCurator)`: Gallery owner can appoint or remove curators.
 *    - `isCurator(address _account)`: Check if an address is a curator.
 *
 * **7. Utility & Information:**
 *    - `getGalleryOwner()`: Get the address of the gallery owner.
 *    - `getGalleryFeePercentage()`: Get the current gallery fee percentage.
 *    - `getTotalArtworksCreated()`: Get the total number of artworks created in the gallery.
 *    - `getTotalArtists()`: Get the total number of approved artists.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 *  - **Artist Reputation System:** Tracks artist performance and community feedback.
 *  - **Dynamic Pricing (Popularity-Based):**  Artwork prices can adjust based on demand and popularity.
 *  - **Curated Exhibitions with Voting:**  Decentralized curation process for showcasing art.
 *  - **Decentralized Governance (Policy Proposals & Voting):** Community involvement in gallery policy decisions.
 *  - **Gallery Fee Structure:**  Sustainable model with fees for gallery operation.
