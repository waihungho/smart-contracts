/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author AI Solidity Mastermind
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling collaborative art creation, ownership, governance, and exhibitions.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Collective Functions:**
 *    - `joinCollective(string _artistName)`: Allows artists to join the collective by registering their name.
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Allows artists to leave the collective.
 *    - `getCollectiveMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of collective members.
 *    - `isCollectiveMember(address _artist)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `getArtistName(address _artist)`: Retrieves the registered name of an artist.
 *
 * **2. Collaborative Art Proposal & Creation:**
 *    - `proposeArtProject(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to propose new art projects with title, description, and IPFS hash of details.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on proposed art projects (simple majority).
 *    - `executeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved art proposal (creates the art piece).
 *    - `getArtProjectDetails(uint256 _projectId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art project.
 *    - `getArtProjectVoteCount(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns the vote count for a project.
 *    - `isArtProjectApproved(uint256 _projectId)`: Checks if an art project has been approved.
 *
 * **3. Decentralized Art Ownership & NFTs:**
 *    - `mintArtNFT(uint256 _projectId)`: Mints an NFT representing an approved art project, owned by the collective.
 *    - `transferArtNFT(uint256 _projectId, address _recipient)`: Transfers ownership of an art NFT (governed by collective vote).
 *    - `burnArtNFT(uint256 _projectId)`: Burns/destroys an art NFT (governed by collective vote).
 *    - `getArtNFTOwner(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns the current owner of an art NFT.
 *    - `getArtNFTContractAddress(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns the address of the NFT contract for a given project.
 *
 * **4. Art Exhibition & Revenue Sharing:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256[] _projectIds)`: Creates a new art exhibition featuring selected art projects.
 *    - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts an exhibition, making it active.
 *    - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends an exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of an exhibition.
 *    - `isExhibitionActive(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Checks if an exhibition is currently active.
 *    - `purchaseExhibitionTicket(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Allows users to purchase tickets to an active exhibition.
 *    - `claimExhibitionRevenueShare(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Allows collective members to claim their share of exhibition ticket revenue.
 *
 * **5. Advanced Collective Governance & Features:**
 *    - `setProposalQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Allows the collective to change the quorum required for proposal approval (governed vote needed).
 *    - `depositToCollective()`: Allows anyone to deposit funds to the collective's treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromCollective(uint256 _amount)`: Allows collective members to propose withdrawals from the treasury (governed vote needed).
 *    - `setPlatformFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows the collective to set a platform fee percentage on exhibition ticket sales.
 *
 * **Note:** This contract is a conceptual example and requires further development, security audits, and considerations for gas optimization and real-world deployment. It showcases advanced concepts like DAO governance, NFT integration, and revenue sharing in a creative art collective context.
