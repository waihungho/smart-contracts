/**
 * @title NFT Aggregator & Fractionalizer with Dynamic Governance
 * @author Bard (An AI Language Model)
 * @notice This contract allows users to deposit NFTs, fractionalize them into ERC20 tokens, and participate in dynamic governance related to the NFT's future (e.g., selling, renting, metaverse integration).  It incorporates a unique time-weighted voting system to minimize influence from sudden bursts of token holdings.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **NFT Deposit & Fractionalization:** Users deposit ERC721 NFTs. The contract mints ERC20 tokens representing fractional ownership.
 * 2. **Dynamic Governance (Proposals):**
 *    - Proposal creation:  Token holders can propose actions related to the underlying NFT.
 *    - Time-weighted voting: Votes are weighted based on how long the voter has held the governance tokens.
 *    - Proposal execution:  If a proposal passes, the contract executes the proposed action.
 * 3. **NFT Management:**  The contract manages the deposited NFT, enabling actions like selling, renting, or integrating into other platforms, as determined by governance.
 * 4. **Emergency Brake:** A multi-sig (or DAO) can pause critical functions in case of unforeseen issues.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `depositNFT(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol, uint256 _decimals, uint256 _fractionalUnits)`: Deposits an NFT, mints ERC20 tokens.
 * - `withdrawNFT(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Withdraws an NFT after a successful proposal to do so.
 * - `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _data)`: Creates a governance proposal.
 * - `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _supports)`: Casts a vote on a proposal.
 * - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes.
 * - `getProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns proposal details.
 * - `getTokenBalance(address _tokenContract, address _account)`: Returns an account's balance of a specific token.
 * - `getTimeWeightedVotePower(address _voter)`: Calculates the time-weighted vote power of an address.
 * - `pause()`, `unpause()`: Pauses and unpauses critical contract functions (multi-sig/DAO controlled).
 *
 * **ERC20 Implementation (Simplified):**  The contract includes a simplified ERC20 implementation for the fractionalized tokens to avoid external dependencies.  A full ERC20 implementation should be used in production.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Outline and Summary:**  The top of the code provides a clear outline and function summary, essential for understanding the contract's purpose and functionality.
* **NFT Deposit and Fractionalization:** Allows users to deposit ERC721 NFTs.  It mints ERC20 tokens representing fractional ownership. Crucially, it *transfers ownership* of the NFT to the contract.
* **Dynamic Governance (Proposals):**
    * **Proposal Creation:** Token holders can propose actions related to the underlying NFT.
    * **Time-Weighted Voting:**  Votes are weighted based on how long the voter has held the governance tokens.  This helps prevent manipulation by large holders who acquire tokens just before a vote.  **IMPORTANT:** The provided implementation of `getTimeWeightedVotePower` is intentionally simplified and *requires a much more sophisticated implementation in a production environment*.  I've included comments highlighting this. A real implementation would need to track token acquisition times, likely using events and a separate data structure.
    * **Proposal Execution:** If a proposal passes, the contract executes the proposed action using `call`.  This makes the contract very flexible. The `data` field of the `Proposal` struct stores the ABI-encoded function call data.
* **NFT Management:** The contract manages the deposited NFT, enabling actions like selling, renting, or integrating into other platforms, *as determined by governance*.
* **Emergency Brake:**  A multi-sig (or DAO) can pause critical functions in case of unforeseen issues.  This is crucial for security.  Uses OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` contract.
* **ERC20 Implementation (Simplified):**  Includes a very basic ERC20 implementation. **CRITICAL:**  A real-world contract *must* use a battle-tested ERC20 library like OpenZeppelin's.  I've added prominent comments about this.  The simplified version is only for demonstration purposes.
* **Events:**  Events are emitted to track key actions, making the contract auditable.
* **Modifiers:**  Modifiers are used to enforce access control and preconditions.  `onlyMultiSig`, `onlyIfNFTDeposited`, and `onlyDuringVotingPeriod` increase code readability and security.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `require` statements to check for invalid conditions and revert transactions with informative error messages.
* **Clear Comments:**  The code is heavily commented to explain each step.
* **OpenZeppelin Imports:**  Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC721 interface, Pausability, and Ownable (access control), improving security and code quality.
* **Deterministic Token Contract Address:** Generates token contract address using keccak256 to prevent collision
* **Proposal State:** The `ProposalState` enum is removed to simplify the logic but keep most of the functionality.  The `executed` boolean tracks whether a proposal has been executed.  This is combined with `startTime` and `endTime` to determine the proposal's state in practice.
* **`Ownable`:** The contract now inherits from `Ownable` to provide a simple owner-based access control mechanism, although the multi-sig is still crucial for the emergency pause functionality.
* **Quorum:**  The Quorum is now calculated correctly, and is required for execution.
* **Correct TransferFrom:** Added a standard compliant `transferFrom` function.
* **TotalSupply:** Added `totalSupply` calculation.

**How to use the contract:**

1. **Deploy the contract:** Deploy `NFTAggregator`, providing the address of your multi-sig wallet (or DAO) to the constructor.
2. **Deposit an NFT:**  Call `depositNFT`, providing the NFT contract address, token ID, and desired token name/symbol. You (the depositor) must *approve* the `NFTAggregator` contract to transfer the NFT before calling `depositNFT`. The NFT will be transferred to the `NFTAggregator` contract.
3. **Create a proposal:** Call `createProposal` to create a new governance proposal.  The `_data` field is critical.  It must be the *ABI-encoded* call data for the function you want to execute on this contract (or another contract).  For example, if you want to propose selling the NFT, the `_data` might be `abi.encodeWithSignature("sellNFT(address,uint256,uint256)", nftContractAddress, tokenId, salePrice);`
4. **Cast votes:**  Token holders call `castVote` to vote on proposals.
5. **Execute a proposal:**  After the voting period, call `executeProposal` to execute a successful proposal. The contract will use `call` to execute the data provided in the proposal.

**Important Security Considerations:**

* **Time-Weighted Voting:** Implement a *robust* time-weighted voting system to prevent manipulation.
* **ERC20 Token:** Use a proper ERC20 token library.  The simplified implementation is *not* secure.
* **Reentrancy:**  Be extremely careful about reentrancy attacks, especially when executing proposals using `call`. Consider using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` if necessary. The current design tries to avoid reentrancy issues by executing proposals with `address(this).call()`, but thorough auditing is essential.
* **Call Data Validation:**  When executing proposals, carefully validate the `_data` to prevent unintended actions.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed functions or contracts.
* **Multi-Sig Security:** Ensure the multi-sig wallet is properly secured.
* **Auditing:**  Have the contract thoroughly audited by security professionals before deploying it to production.
* **Upgradeability:**  Consider using an upgradeable contract pattern to allow for future bug fixes and feature enhancements. This adds complexity but can be worthwhile.

This is a sophisticated contract with many moving parts. Thorough testing and auditing are essential before deploying it to a live environment. Remember to replace the simplified components (ERC20, time-weighted voting) with robust, well-tested implementations.
