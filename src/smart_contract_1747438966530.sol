Okay, here is a smart contract concept called `TimeSculptor`. It focuses on managing time-bound, decaying rights and value through unique "Chronon Slices." It incorporates concepts like time-decaying power, fragmentation, merging, delegation, and integrated governance based on this dynamic power. It aims to be creative by treating time itself as a sculptable, ownable, and dynamic resource within the contract.

This contract is for educational purposes and demonstrates advanced concepts. It is *not* audited or production-ready.

/// @author YourName (Placeholder)
/// @notice A novel contract managing time-bound, decaying rights and value via unique "Chronon Slices".
/// It allows users to mint, fragment, merge, delegate, and utilize time-based power for governance and rewards.
/// This contract treats time itself as a sculptable resource tied to ETH value, enabling dynamic, ephemeral rights.

/// @dev Outline:
/// 1. Core State & Configuration: Owner, counters, costs, reward tracking.
/// 2. Structs: Definition of ChrononSlice and Proposal objects.
/// 3. Events: Signalling key actions (minting, fragmenting, voting, etc.).
/// 4. Modifiers: Access control and state checks.
/// 5. Slice Management: Minting, getting details, ownership, checking activity.
/// 6. Advanced Slice Operations: Fragmentation, Merging, Transfer, Burning, Data Attachment.
/// 7. Power & Delegation: Calculating decay power, delegation mechanisms.
/// 8. Rewards: Accumulating and claiming rewards based on dynamic slice power.
/// 9. Governance: Creating proposals, voting using time-decaying power, executing proposals.
/// 10. Utility & Admin: Time retrieval, cost calculation, withdrawals.

/// @dev Function Summary:
/// - Configuration:
///     - constructor: Initializes the contract with the deployer as owner.
///     - updateMintCostPerSecond: Allows owner to adjust the cost of minting time.
/// - Slice Management (Core):

///     - getSliceData: Retrieves the data attached to a slice.
///     - fragmentSlice: Splits an active slice into two new slices with shorter durations (owner only).
///     - mergeSlices: Combines multiple active slices owned by the same user into a single new slice (owner only).
///     - transferSlice: Transfers ownership of a slice (if transferable, or owner transfer).
///     - burnSlice: Destroys an active slice, forfeiting remaining time and power (owner only).
/// - Power & Delegation:
///     - getSliceCurrentPower: Calculates the dynamic power of a slice based on its remaining active time.

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Chronon Slices:** These are the core "assets". They are unique NFTs (though not using the ERC-721 interface directly to avoid duplicating a standard library) representing a specific segment of time.
2.  **Time-Based Dynamics:** Each slice has a start and end time. Crucially, its "power" (used for governance and rewards) decays linearly from its `initialPower` (based on duration) at the `startTime` to zero at the `endTime`. This introduces an inherent time-sensitivity and decay mechanic.
3.  **Value from Time:** Minting slices requires ETH payment, tying value directly to the concept of owning a segment of time with associated rights/power. This ETH can be directed into a reward pool.
4.  **Sculpting Time (Fragment & Merge):** Users can fragment a longer slice into multiple shorter ones or merge multiple slices into a single longer one. This adds a layer of manipulability to the time assets, allowing users to adjust their time portfolio.
5.  **Data Attachment:** Slices can carry arbitrary data (`bytes`), allowing them to function as time-stamped records or containers for other information linked to that specific time period.
6.  **Decaying Power:** The `getSliceCurrentPower` function implements the linear decay. This dynamic power is the basis for participation in the protocol (voting, rewards).
7.  **Delegation:** Slice owners can delegate the power of their *active* slices to another address for a limited duration. This allows for liquid power or representation without transferring ownership of the slice NFT itself.
8.  **Rewards:** A simplified reward system uses an accumulator pattern (`accruedRewardsPerPower`, `userRewardDebt`) to distribute ETH from a pool proportionally to the historical power held by users. This incentivizes holding and using active slices.
9.  **Integrated Governance:** The contract includes a simple proposal and voting system. Voting power is directly tied to the user's `getUserTotalActivePower` (including owned and delegated slices), making governance participation dependent on actively managing or holding Chronon Slices. Proposals can trigger arbitrary contract calls if executed.
10. **Non-Duplication Focus:** While concepts like NFTs (ChrononSlices), DAOs (Proposals), and yield farming (Rewards) exist in open source, this contract implements a custom, interconnected system of these concepts centered around the unique idea of time-bound, decaying, fragmentable power units, without directly inheriting or copying standard interfaces like ERC721 or common DAO/reward structures from libraries like OpenZeppelin. The implementation details for fragmentation, merging, decaying power calculation, and coupled delegation/voting/rewards based on this specific power decay model are designed to be distinct.

This contract provides a rich environment for exploring dynamic asset management, time-based mechanics, and novel governance structures on-chain.
