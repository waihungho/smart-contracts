Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept I've designed, focusing on a combination of time-based mechanics (epochs), conditional releases, delegated access, and multi-entry user vaults. It's called `ChronoBankVault`.

It's not a standard ERC-20/NFT vault, staking contract, or simple time lock. It allows users to deposit funds into specific "vault entries," each with its own unlock conditions (based on time *or* external triggers) and potentially allowing for delegated management. The state of the vault also influences available actions.

This design incorporates several advanced concepts:

1.  **Epoch-based Time:** Rather than just Unix timestamps, time is divided into discrete epochs, useful for calculating yields, penalties, or activating conditions periodically.
2.  **Conditional Release:** Funds can be locked until a specific external or internal condition is marked as met.
3.  **Multi-Entry Vaults:** A single user can have multiple distinct deposit entries, each with different parameters (token, amount, lock duration, condition).
4.  **Delegated Access:** Users can grant limited permission to others to manage specific vault entries (e.g., initiate withdrawal).
5.  **Vault State Machine:** The contract operates in different states (`Active`, `Paused`, `Emergency`, `Settling`), restricting or enabling certain actions.
6.  **Keeper Role:** A specific role (or anyone, incentivized) can trigger epoch transitions or condition checks.
7.  **Simulated Oracle/Condition Manager:** A designated role can update the status of external conditions.
8.  **Batch Operations:** Functions for depositing or withdrawing multiple entries in one transaction (gas optimization).
9.  **Penalty/Reward System:** Built-in hooks for calculating penalties on early exit or potential rewards based on epoch completion (though the exact reward logic is a placeholder).

/**
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * Admin/Owner Functions:
 * - constructor(): Initializes contract, sets owner, initial epoch.
 * - setEpochDuration(uint256 _duration): Sets the length of each epoch in seconds.
 * - setAllowedToken(address _token, bool _isAllowed): Adds or removes a token from the allowed list.
 * - defineCondition(bytes32 _conditionId, ConditionType _type, bytes memory _data): Defines a new unlock condition.
 * - updateConditionMetStatus(bytes32 _conditionId, bool _metStatus): Updates the 'met' status of a specific condition (requires CONDITION_MANAGER_ROLE).

 *
 * Epoch & Time Functions:
 * - startNextEpoch(): Transitions the vault to the next epoch if the current one is over (callable by anyone, potential keeper function).
 * - getCurrentEpoch(): Returns the current epoch number.
 * - getEpochEndTime(): Returns the timestamp when the current epoch ends.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Design Choices:**

1.  **Epoch System:** Instead of relying solely on timestamps for vesting or lockups, epochs provide discrete periods. This simplifies calculations (e.g., "locked for 10 epochs") and allows for epoch-based events like reward distribution or state changes. `startNextEpoch` can be called by anyone after the duration passes, potentially enabling a keeper network model where keepers are incentivized (though not implemented with explicit incentives here) to advance epochs.
2.  **Conditional Release:** The `Condition` struct and `releaseConditionId` introduce a powerful mechanism. Funds aren't just time-locked; they can require external triggers (`ExternalTrigger`), oracle data (`OraclePriceBelow`), or other custom logic (`EpochReached`). The `ConditionType` enum allows for extensibility. The `updateConditionMetStatus` function acts as a simulated oracle or condition manager interface.
3.  **Multi-Entry Vaults (`UserVault[]`)**: A user isn't limited to a single deposit. They can create multiple `UserVault` entries, each with its own token, amount, lock duration, and condition. This adds flexibility for users to manage different tranches of assets with varied terms. The `entryIndex` helps reference these specific deposits.
4.  **Vault State Machine (`VaultState`)**: The contract isn't just "on" or "off" (paused). `Active`, `Paused`, `Emergency`, and `Settling` states (Settling is conceptualized but not fully implemented logic for transition) allow the contract to react to different scenarios, restricting certain operations (deposits only in `Active`, emergency withdrawals only in `Emergency`, etc.).
5.  **Delegated Access (`Delegation`)**: The owner of a specific `UserVault` entry can delegate the *right to initiate or complete withdrawal* for *that specific entry* to another address for a limited time. This is useful for account management, custodial services, or multi-sig controlled entries. `_checkEntryAuthorization` handles this logic.
6.  **Batch Operations (`batchDeposit`, `batchInitiateWithdrawal`, `batchCompleteWithdrawal`)**: Grouping multiple operations into one transaction saves gas costs for users interacting with several entries.
7.  **Early Exit with Penalty (`earlyExit`, `calculateEarlyExitPenalty`)**: Users aren't strictly forbidden from withdrawing early but face a penalty, which could be dynamic based on time remaining or epochs skipped. This provides flexibility while discouraging breaking terms.
8.  **Keeper Trigger (`triggerTimeBasedConditionCheck`)**: While simplified here, this function represents a pattern where off-chain keepers or automated bots can call functions to advance the contract's state or trigger checks based on time or other public data.
9.  **Modular Condition Types**: The `ConditionType` enum and the `defineCondition` / `updateConditionMetStatus` pattern allow for defining and managing various conditions without modifying core deposit/withdrawal logic significantly (beyond checking `isVaultEntryUnlocked`).

This contract provides a flexible framework for managing token deposits under complex, time-and-condition-dependent rules, going beyond the features typically found in simple open-source vault examples. Note that features like yield calculation logic within the contract (`_calculateEpochRewards`) are left as placeholders as the specific economic model was not defined. A production contract would require significantly more robust error handling, gas optimization, and potentially formal verification.
