/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Pricing Oracle (DDPO)
 * @author AI Assistant & Example User
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized dynamic pricing oracle that allows users to query prices 
 *         for assets determined by a time-weighted average of user-submitted price reports.  It leverages
 *         a reputation system for reporters to mitigate malicious price submissions and incentivize accurate reporting.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *   - **Data Structures:** `Report`, `Reporter`, `Asset`
 *   - **Storage:** Mapping of asset to `Asset` data, mapping of reporter address to `Reporter` data, global parameters
 *   - **Events:** `ReportSubmitted`, `PriceUpdated`, `ReporterRegistered`, `ReporterDeactivated`, `ReputationAdjusted`
 *   - **Functions:**
 *     - `registerReporter()`: Allows users to register as price reporters.
 *     - `submitReport(assetId, price)`:  Allows registered reporters to submit a price report for a specific asset.
 *     - `getPrice(assetId)`:  Returns the current price for a given asset, calculated as a weighted average.
 *     - `getReporterReputation(reporter)`: Returns the reputation score of a reporter.
 *     - `reportInaccurateReport(assetId, reportingRound, reporter)`:  Allows users to report potentially inaccurate reports.  This initiates a voting period where token holders stake for or against the report's accuracy.
 *     - `resolveInaccurateReport(assetId, reportingRound)`:  Resolves an inaccurate report after the voting period, adjusting reporter reputation based on the outcome.
 *     - `deactivateReporter(reporter)`: Allows the owner (or a designated governance contract) to deactivate a reporter.
 *
 *  **Advanced Concepts Used:**
 *   - **Time-Weighted Average Price:**  Prices decay over time, giving more weight to recent reports.
 *   - **Reputation System:**  Reporters gain or lose reputation based on the accuracy of their reports, influencing their weight in the price calculation.
 *   - **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:**  Users can report inaccurate reports, triggering a voting mechanism to determine the report's validity.  This uses a simplified staking and voting mechanism for illustrative purposes (in a real-world scenario, integration with a dedicated governance token and voting system is recommended).
 *   - **Reporting Rounds:** Each report submission defines a 'round' indexed by the asset and number of reports received for that asset, to resolve inaccurate reports in parallel.

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Clear Documentation:**  Each function and the overall contract has detailed NatSpec documentation, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.  This is crucial for maintainability and understanding.
* **Bytes32 Asset IDs:** Using `bytes32` for `assetId` provides greater flexibility and avoids unnecessary string manipulation within the contract.
* **Reporting Rounds and Disputes:** The `reportInaccurateReport` and `resolveInaccurateReport` functions provide the ability to dispute price reports.  This is a critical feature for a decentralized oracle, allowing for verification of data integrity.  The rounds solve issues for parallel reporting and verification of submission.
* **Voting Mechanism:**  A simple voting mechanism (using token staking) is included to determine the outcome of disputes. *Important:* This is a simplified example.  A real-world oracle would integrate with a dedicated governance token and voting system, allowing token holders to participate in the dispute resolution process.
* **Time-Weighted Average:** The `_updatePrice` function calculates the price as a time-weighted average.  This gives more weight to recent reports, making the oracle more responsive to changes in the market.
* **Reputation System:** Reporters gain or lose reputation based on the accuracy of their reports. The `reportInaccurateReport` can penalize reporters that reports incorrectly.  The higher reputation is directly used to compute weight on price for higher quality.
* **Reporting Validity Window:**  Reports are only considered valid for a limited time. This prevents stale data from affecting the price.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:** This version focuses on clarity and functionality. Further optimizations (e.g., using libraries for arithmetic operations, optimizing storage access patterns) would be necessary for a production environment.
* **Error Handling:**  The contract includes appropriate `require` statements to prevent invalid operations and ensure data integrity.
* **Event Emission:**  Events are emitted for all key actions, allowing external systems to monitor the contract's state.
* **`onlyReporter` Modifier:** The `onlyReporter` modifier simplifies the code and makes it more readable.
* **Clear State Management:** The code clearly manages the state of the contract (e.g., asset prices, reporter reputations).
* **Dispute Logic:** The contract includes logic for resolving disputes, increasing or decreasing reporter reputation based on the outcome.
* **Reentrancy Prevention:** While this contract doesn't have obvious reentrancy vulnerabilities in its current form, *always* consider reentrancy attacks when developing Solidity contracts, especially when external calls are involved.  Use techniques like the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern or reentrancy guard libraries to mitigate this risk.

**How to Test:**

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the `DecentralizedDynamicPricingOracle` contract to a local blockchain environment like Ganache or a test network like Goerli or Sepolia.
2.  **Register Reporters:** Call the `registerReporter()` function from multiple accounts to register them as reporters.
3.  **Submit Reports:** Have the registered reporters call the `submitReport()` function for the same `assetId` with different prices.
4.  **Get the Price:** Call the `getPrice()` function to retrieve the current price.  The price should be a weighted average of the submitted prices.
5.  **Report Inaccurate Report:** Call `reportInaccurateReport` and set a round of reporting for dispute.
6.  **Vote on a Report:**  Have multiple accounts vote on the accuracy of the report using `voteOnReport`.
7.  **Resolve Inaccurate Report:** After the voting period, call the `resolveInaccurateReport` function.
8.  **Verify Reputation:** Check the reporters' reputations using `getReporterReputation()` after resolving the inaccurate reports.  Reporters who submitted inaccurate reports should have their reputations decreased.
9.  **Deactivate Reporter:**  Call `deactivateReporter` to deactivate a reporter, and then try submitting a report from that reporter's account. It should fail.
10. **Test edge cases** Test with different validity windows, large price differences in the reports, and different levels of voting participation.

This significantly expanded explanation provides a more robust and secure foundation for a decentralized dynamic pricing oracle. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment.
