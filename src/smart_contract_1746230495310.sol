Okay, here is a smart contract concept called `QuantumFusionVault`. It's designed to be a multi-asset vault (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) where users can deposit assets, and then combine *specific* sets of deposited assets ("Fusion") to potentially trigger a probabilistic "Measurement" that changes the vault's operational "Superposition Mode" and unlocks global "Vault Features".

This concept incorporates:
1.  **Multi-Asset Management:** Handling three standard token types.
2.  **Complex State:** The vault has distinct `SuperpositionMode`s.
3.  **Dynamic Features:** Vault features can be globally active or inactive, affecting all users.
4.  **Recipe-Based Interaction:** Users combine specific inputs.
5.  **Probabilistic Outcome:** The result of 'Measurement' is weighted, potentially influenced by an oracle.
6.  **Separation of Input/Output:** 'Fusion' consumes assets but 'Measurement' triggers the state change.
7.  **Advanced Access Control:** Different roles for owner, recipe curator, and oracle caller.

It aims to be creative by moving beyond simple staking/farming into a more game-like or experimental state-changing mechanic.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFusionVault`

**Concept:**
A multi-asset vault (`ERC-20`, `ERC-721`, `ERC-1155`) where users deposit tokens and NFTs. Deposited assets can be consumed in "Fusion" rituals based on predefined recipes. Fusion attempts contribute to a pool of potential energy for a "Measurement" event. When `measureVaultState` is triggered (potentially periodically or by a privileged role), a probabilistic outcome is determined based on the fusion attempts and potentially external data (via an oracle). This outcome changes the vault's global `SuperpositionMode` and activates or deactivates specific `VaultFeature`s, which can affect vault parameters (e.g., withdrawal fees, yield multipliers - *simulation shown here as the vault doesn't generate yield itself*).

**Asset Types Handled:**
*   **Catalysts:** ERC-20 tokens. Required in specific amounts for fusion recipes.
*   **Artifacts:** ERC-721 NFTs. Required as specific token IDs for fusion recipes (or perhaps a count of a specific token type). *Handling specific IDs is more complex, let's use counts per type in recipes for simplicity, but track ownership of individual IDs for withdrawal.*
*   **Essences:** ERC-1155 tokens. Required as specific token IDs and amounts for fusion recipes.

**Core Mechanisms:**
*   **Deposit:** Users transfer assets into the vault, recording their internal balance/ownership.
*   **Withdraw:** Users withdraw their deposited assets.
*   **Fusion:** Users consume required deposited assets based on a recipe. This *registers* a fusion attempt for the next Measurement phase.
*   **Measurement:** A privileged action that processes registered fusion attempts, consults an oracle (simulated), determines a probabilistic outcome based on recipe weights and attempts, updates the vault's global state (`SuperpositionMode`, `VaultFeature`s), and resets attempt counters.
*   **State/Feature Management:** Querying current modes and active features.
*   **Recipe Management:** Adding, removing, and viewing fusion recipes (managed by a Curator role).
*   **Access Control:** Owner, Recipe Curator, Oracle Caller roles.

    // --- Manual updates based on Refactored Struct and Total Tracking ---
    // 1. Add `vaultArtifactTotals` and `vaultEssenceTotals` to state variables. (Done)
    // 2. Update `depositArtifact`, `withdrawArtifact` to modify `vaultArtifactTotals`. (Done)
    // 3. Update `depositEssence`, `withdrawEssence` to modify `vaultEssenceTotals`. (Done)
    // 4. Update `getVaultArtifactCount`, `getVaultEssenceBalance` to return the tracked totals. (Done)
    // 5. Update `FusionRecipe` struct definition. (Done)
    // 6. Update `addFusionRecipe` calldata parameter and internal logic to use the new struct. (Done)
    // 7. Update `getFusionRecipeDetails` return type and logic. (Done)
    // 8. Update `canInitiateFusion` to use the array fields of the recipe. (Done)
    // 9. Update `initiateFusion` to use the array fields for requirement checks and consumption. (Done)
    // 10. Update `measureVaultState` to use the new struct fields for outcome application (`featuresToSetAsActive`). (Done)

    // The code provided above *already incorporates* these manual updates based on the refined struct and total tracking.
    // The initial text description might lag behind the final code structure slightly due to the iterative process.


    // --- Remaining potential functions (could add if needed) ---
    // - `getUserArtifactTokenIds(address user, address token)`: Query specific token IDs owned by a user for a type (hard without iterating, likely needs offchain).
    // - Functions to define effects of features (e.g., `getWithdrawalFee()`, `getYieldMultiplier()`). These would be view functions that check `isFeatureActive()`.
    // - Functions to trigger ExternalIntegration feature effects.
    // - Functions to manage allowed ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155 tokens.
    // - More complex oracle interaction logic (e.g., different oracle data influencing different recipes/features).
    // - Time-based restrictions on `measureVaultState`.
    // - User-specific unlocked features (instead of global).
    // - Tiered fusion outcomes based on attempt count or oracle data.


    // Fallback/Receive functions (optional but good practice if receiving native ETH)
