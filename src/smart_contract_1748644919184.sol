Okay, let's design a smart contract that represents a dynamic, evolving, and reputation-bound digital entity. We'll call it a "Symbiotic State Entity" (SSE). It's not a standard token or NFT, but a unique asset type with internal state variables that change based on time, interactions, and the collective "reputation" of its holders.

**Concept:**

The Symbiotic State Entity (SSE) is a unique, non-fungible core asset that also issues fractional, semi-fungible "Shards". The SSE has internal state parameters (Energy, Growth Stage, Complexity) that decay over time but can be boosted by holder contributions. Holders of Shards gain Reputation within the SSE ecosystem by interacting positively. Contribution ability and rewards might be tied to Reputation. The SSE can undergo "Evolution" or "Adaptation" events if certain state conditions are met, potentially changing its parameters or distributing rewards/new shards.

**Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Dynamic State:** The entity's parameters change over time (`currentEnergy` decays) and based on interactions.
2.  **Reputation-Bound Interaction:** User ability to interact (contribute, trigger evolution) is gated by their internal reputation score within the SSE.
3.  **Custom Fractionalization:** Shards are not standard ERC-1155, but a custom balance tracking system tied to the unique SSE core.
4.  **Evolution & Adaptation:** Discrete events (`evolveState`, `triggerAdaptation`) that change the entity's fundamental state or parameters based on internal conditions and history, adding a gamified/unpredictable element.
5.  **State Simulation:** A view function (`simulateFutureState`) that allows users to project the entity's state forward in time without changing the state.
6.  **Symbiotic Economy:** Shard holders contribute resources (ETH/tokens) to the SSE; the SSE's growth/health benefits the shard holders (potential rewards, new shards).
