Okay, here's a comprehensive and advanced Solidity smart contract, following all your requirements. I've designed it around a concept I'm calling "CognitiveDAO," which aims to integrate AI-driven insights with decentralized human governance for a self-improving, community-driven platform.

The core idea is a DAO that manages contributions to AI model development (data, feedback, auditing), incentivizes participation with a native token and reputation, and allows an off-chain AI oracle to propose initiatives or suggest resource allocations, which are then subject to community voting. It also includes an interesting prediction market for the success of AI initiatives.

I've made sure to avoid direct duplication of existing major open-source projects by focusing on the unique *combination* and *application* of these concepts within a single, cohesive system. OpenZeppelin libraries are used for standard functionalities like ERC20 and access control, which is common practice and not considered "duplication" of core logic.

/*
*   Contract Name: CognitiveDAO
*
*   Outline and Function Summary:
*
*   Theme:
*   A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to facilitate the collaborative training and curation
*   of AI models, leveraging AI insights for governance and resource allocation. It integrates a unique
*   reputation system, a proof-of-contribution mechanism, and a dynamic governance model, with a simulated
*   oracle for AI interaction and a novel AI outcome prediction market.
*
*   Core Concepts:
*   - AI-Assisted Governance: An off-chain AI (via a simulated oracle) can propose initiatives, suggest
*     treasury allocations, and provide insights, which the DAO members then vote on.
*   - Proof-of-Cognition (PoC): Rewards members for tangible, verifiable contributions to AI model development
*     (e.g., data curation, model fine-tuning feedback, AI auditing).
*   - Adaptive Governance: DAO parameters (like proposal thresholds, voting duration, quorum) can dynamically
*     adjust based on community engagement and the perceived performance of the AI.
*   - Reputation System: Builds trust and influence for members based on their constructive participation,
*     successful contributions, and voting history.
*   - AI Outcome Prediction Markets: Allows members to stake tokens on the success or failure of specific
*     AI-driven initiatives or proposals, fostering collective intelligence and incentivizing accurate predictions.
*
*   Function List (25 Functions):
*
*   I. Core DAO & Token Management:
*   1.  constructor: Deploys the DAO token ($COGNITO), initializes roles (owner, oracle, contribution committee),
*       and sets initial DAO parameters.
*   2.  registerMember: Allows new users to register as a DAO member, optionally requiring an initial stake
*       to join the governance.
*   3.  stakeTokens: Users stake their $COGNITO tokens to acquire voting power and begin accumulating reputation.
*   4.  unstakeTokens: Allows users to unstake their tokens after a predefined cool-down period, reducing their voting power.
*   5.  getVotingPower: Returns a member's current effective voting power, considering their stake, reputation,
*       and any delegations to or from them.
*
*   II. Governance & Proposal System:
*   6.  submitProposal: Enables members with sufficient voting power to submit various types of governance proposals
*       (e.g., smart contract upgrades, parameter changes, treasury spending).
*   7.  voteOnProposal: Allows members to cast their vote (Yes/No/Abstain) on any active and open proposal.
*   8.  executeProposal: Executes a proposal that has successfully passed the voting phase and meets all required
*       quorum and majority conditions.
*   9.  delegateVote: Allows a member to delegate their voting power to another trusted member, fostering a
*       representative governance model.
*   10. revokeDelegation: Revokes a previously set vote delegation, returning voting power to the original member.
*
*   III. AI Integration (Simulated Oracle Interaction):
*   11. requestAIIdea: Triggers an event indicating a request for the off-chain AI oracle to generate a new
*       proposal, insight, or strategic suggestion.
*   12. submitAIGeneratedProposal: Callable exclusively by the designated AI Oracle, this function introduces
*       an AI-generated proposal directly into the DAO's voting system.
*   13. updateAIPerformanceMetric: A governance-controlled function (intended to be called via a DAO proposal)
*       to update a metric representing the AI's perceived performance or efficacy, which can influence its
*       future suggestions' weight or priority.
*
*   IV. Proof-of-Cognition (PoC) & Rewards:
*   14. submitCognitionProof: Members submit a hashed proof of their off-chain contribution (e.g., validated AI
*       dataset entries, successful model fine-tuning feedback, bug reports in AI models).
*   15. verifyAndRewardContribution: Callable by a designated 'Contribution Committee' multi-sig, this function
*       verifies submitted proofs and distributes $COGNITO rewards and reputation based on the contribution's value.
*   16. claimContributionReward: (Conceptual) Allows the verified contributor to claim their earned $COGNITO tokens.
*       (Note: In this specific implementation, rewards are transferred directly upon verification for simplicity).
*
*   V. Reputation & Adaptive Governance:
*   17. getMemberReputation: Retrieves the current reputation score of a specific member, reflecting their
*       overall positive engagement and impact within the DAO.
*   18. updateGovernanceParameter: A critical function, executed via a successful governance proposal, allowing
*       the DAO to dynamically adjust core parameters such as proposal threshold, voting duration, or quorum requirements.
*
*   VI. AI Outcome Prediction Market:
*   19. createAIOutcomeMarket: Enables any member to create a prediction market on the success or failure of a
*       specific AI-driven initiative or the outcome of a significant AI model milestone.
*   20. placeBet: Allows members to place a bet by staking tokens on a specific outcome (e.g., 'AI Proposal X will
*       increase engagement by Y%', 'Model performance will reach Z accuracy').
*   21. resolveAIOutcomeMarket: Callable by a designated 'Outcome Oracle' or specific governance vote, this
*       function resolves the market based on the actual outcome, determining winners and losers.
*   22. claimMarketWinnings: Allows participants to claim their proportionate winnings from a resolved prediction market.
*
*   VII. Treasury & Emergency Management:
*   23. requestAITreasurySuggestion: Triggers an event requesting the AI Oracle to provide suggestions on
*       optimal treasury fund allocation for community growth or AI development initiatives.
*   24. proposeTreasuryAllocation: Submits a proposal for spending DAO treasury funds, potentially informed
*       by AI suggestions or direct community needs.
*   25. emergencyPause: Allows a designated emergency multi-sig or highly privileged role to pause critical
*       functions of the contract in case of detected vulnerabilities or severe threats.
*   26. emergencyUnpause: Allows the designated emergency pauser to unpause the contract.
