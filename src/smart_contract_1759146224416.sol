This smart contract, named `AdaptiveYieldStrategist`, introduces an autonomous protocol for adaptive staking and AI-driven asset management. It aims to dynamically allocate user-deposited assets across various DeFi "strategy modules" (e.g., lending protocols, LP farms) to optimize yield and manage risk. The contract integrates with an external AI Oracle to receive intelligent allocation recommendations, supports Flash Loan-assisted rebalancing for capital efficiency, and incorporates NFT-based access and yield boosts for premium features.

The goal is to provide a self-optimizing and adaptable yield strategy that can respond to changing market conditions through a combination of on-chain logic, oracle data, and potential AI insights, while offering advanced user and governance features.

## Contract: `AdaptiveYieldStrategist`

### Description
An Autonomous Protocol for Adaptive Staking & AI-Driven Asset Management. This contract dynamically allocates user-deposited assets across various registered DeFi "strategy modules" (e.g., lending protocols, LP farms) to optimize yield and manage risk. It integrates with an external AI Oracle to receive intelligent allocation recommendations and supports advanced features like Flash Loan-assisted rebalancing and NFT-based access/boosts. The protocol aims to be self-optimizing and adaptable to changing market conditions.

### Core Features
*   **Dynamic Strategy Modules:** Integrates with various external DeFi protocols as interchangeable modules.
*   **AI Oracle Integration:** Receives and processes intelligent allocation recommendations from a trusted AI oracle.
*   **Adaptive Rebalancing Engine:** Automatically or semi-automatically adjusts asset distribution across modules based on parameters, including AI recommendations.
*   **Flash Loan Optimization:** Leverages flash loans for capital-efficient rebalancing operations.
*   **NFT Strategy Keys:** NFTs provide tiered access, yield boosts, or special permissions within the protocol.
*   **Decentralized Strategist Role:** Designated strategists can propose and execute rebalance strategies.
*   **Pausable & Ownable:** Standard security and administrative controls.

### Outline

**I. Core Protocol Management**
    *   Initialization and basic administrative functions.
**II. Strategy Module Management**
    *   Functions to add, remove, and manage external DeFi strategy modules.
**III. User Interaction (Deposits, Withdrawals, Claims)**
    *   Functions for users to interact with their funds and rewards.
**IV. Rebalancing & Optimization Engine**
    *   Logic for proposing, executing, and optimizing asset allocations across modules, including flash loan support.
**V. AI Oracle Integration**
    *   Functions for interacting with and receiving data from an AI oracle.
**VI. Governance & Access Control**
    *   Manages roles like 'Strategist' for rebalance proposals.
**VII. NFT Strategy Keys**
    *   Functions for managing NFTs that grant special protocol access or benefits.
**VIII. Emergency & Security**
    *   Functions for critical emergency actions and token recovery.

### Function Summary

**I. Core Protocol Management**
1.  `constructor(address initialAIOracle, address initialTreasury, address _flashLoanProvider)`: Initializes the contract with an owner, AI oracle, treasury, and flash loan provider address.
2.  `setProtocolOwner(address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of the contract.
3.  `pauseProtocol()`: Pauses all critical operations, preventing deposits, withdrawals, and rebalances.
4.  `unpauseProtocol()`: Unpauses the protocol, re-enabling operations.
5.  `setTreasuryAddress(address newTreasury)`: Sets the address where protocol fees are collected.
6.  `setProtocolFeeRate(uint256 newRate)`: Sets the protocol fee rate in basis points.
7.  `collectProtocolFees(address token)`: Transfers accrued protocol fees of a specific token to the treasury. (Conceptual; real implementation is complex.)

**II. Strategy Module Management**
8.  `addStrategyModule(address moduleAddress, address[] calldata managedTokens, string calldata name)`: Registers a new external DeFi strategy module with its managed tokens and a name.
9.  `removeStrategyModule(address moduleAddress)`: Deregisters an existing strategy module (requires the module to be empty).
10. `updateModuleParameters(address moduleAddress, uint256 newYieldRate, uint256 newRiskScore)`: Manually updates yield rate and risk score for a module (can be overridden by AI).
11. `getAvailableModules()`: Returns a list of all currently active strategy module addresses.
12. `getModuleTotalAssets(address moduleAddress, address token)`: Returns the total amount of a specific token held by a module.

**III. User Interaction (Deposits, Withdrawals, Claims)**
13. `deposit(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit supported tokens into the strategist pool.
14. `withdraw(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to withdraw their deposited tokens.
15. `claimRewards(address token)`: Allows users to claim accumulated rewards for a specific token. (Conceptual; real implementation is complex.)
16. `getUserTotalDeposits(address user, address token)`: Returns the total amount of a specific token deposited by a user.
17. `getPendingRewards(address user, address token)`: Returns the estimated pending rewards for a user for a specific token. (Conceptual; real implementation is complex.)

**IV. Rebalancing & Optimization Engine**
18. `proposeRebalance(address token, address[] calldata moduleAddresses, uint256[] calldata allocationPercentages)`: Allows an authorized strategist to propose new asset allocations across modules for a given token.
19. `executeRebalance(address token)`: Executes the most recently proposed rebalance for a given token, adjusting asset distribution.
20. `getProposedAllocation(address token)`: Returns the current pending proposed allocation percentages for a token.
21. `getCurrentAllocation(address token)`: Returns the currently active asset allocation percentages across modules for a token.
22. `rebalanceWithFlashLoan(bytes calldata userData)`: Initiates a flash loan-assisted rebalance.
23. `receiveFlashLoan(address _initiator, address[] calldata _tokens, uint256[] calldata _amounts, uint256[] calldata _premiums, bytes calldata _userData)`: Callback function for a flash loan, where the actual rebalancing using borrowed funds takes place.

**V. AI Oracle Integration**
24. `setAIOracleAddress(address newAIOracle)`: Sets the address of the trusted AI Oracle.
25. `receiveAIRecommendation(IAIOracle.AIRecommendation calldata recommendation)`: Callback function for the AI Oracle to push new allocation recommendations.
26. `getLatestAIRecommendation()`: Returns the last received recommendation from the AI Oracle.
27. `triggerAIRecommendationRequest()`: Allows authorized entities to signal the AI Oracle to compute a new recommendation.

**VI. Governance & Access Control**
28. `addStrategist(address strategistAddress)`: Grants an address the role of a 'strategist' (can propose rebalances).
29. `removeStrategist(address strategistAddress)`: Revokes the 'strategist' role from an address.
30. `isStrategist(address account)`: Checks if an address holds the 'strategist' role.

**VII. NFT Strategy Keys**
