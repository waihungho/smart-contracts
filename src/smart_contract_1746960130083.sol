Okay, let's design an interesting, advanced smart contract concept focusing on conditional and multi-faceted access control to stored assets, which we'll call the "Quantum Vault". The "quantum" aspect hints at states and requirements that aren't always simply true/false but might depend on a combination of internal state, external factors (simulated), and user-submitted proofs.

This contract manages deposits and allows withdrawals only if a user can prove they meet a dynamically configured set of "Attunement Requirements" which can vary based on the vault's internal "State".

**Disclaimer:** This is a conceptual design to fulfill the prompt's requirements for complexity and function count. Implementing true external data feeds securely (oracles), complex proof verification, or integrating with real-world systems requires significant additional considerations and often off-chain components, which are simulated here for demonstration. This contract should *not* be used in a production environment without rigorous security audits and potentially integrating with robust oracle networks or ZK-proof systems.

**Quantum Vault Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **Version Pragma & Imports:** Specify Solidity version.
2.  **Enums & Constants:** Define possible Vault States and Requirement Types.
3.  **Structs:** Define structures for Attunement Requirements, User Attunement Status, and Withdrawal Requests.
4.  **State Variables:** Store contract owner, supported tokens, vault balances, requirement definitions, current vault state, user attunement proofs, pending withdrawal requests, dynamic fee parameters, temporal user locks, etc.
5.  **Events:** Log significant actions (deposits, withdrawals, state changes, requirement updates, proof submissions, withdrawal requests).
6.  **Modifiers:** Define access control (`ownerOnly`).
7.  **Internal Helper Functions:** Logic for checking individual requirements, calculating fees, checking overall attunement.
8.  **Core Functions:**
    *   **Deployment:** Constructor.
    *   **Asset Management:** Deposit ETH/Tokens, Receive ETH (fallback).
    *   **Admin/Owner Functions:**
        *   Manage Attunement Requirements (add, update, remove).
        *   Manage Vault States (set current state, link requirements to states).
        *   Set Dynamic Fee Parameters.
        *   Set User Temporal Locks.
        *   Manage Supported Tokens.
        *   Emergency functions (e.g., pause - omitted for brevity to focus on core concept functions).
        *   Ownership transfer.
    *   **User Interaction Functions:**
        *   Submit Attunement Proofs.
        *   Request Withdrawal.
        *   Process Eligible Pending Withdrawals (callable by anyone, or specific role).
        *   Cancel Pending Withdrawal Request.
    *   **View Functions:**
        *   Check Vault Balance (ETH/Tokens).
        *   Get Current Vault State.
        *   Get Requirement Details.
        *   Get Active Requirements for Current State.
        *   Check User's Overall Attunement Status.
        *   Get User's Specific Attunement Proof Status.
        *   Get User's Temporal Lock Expiry.

2.  `receive()`: Allows direct ETH deposits to the vault.
3.  `depositETH()`: Explicit function for depositing ETH (alternative to `receive`).
4.  `depositTokens(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows depositing supported tokens.
5.  `addAttunementRequirement(bytes32 reqId, uint256 reqType, bytes data, uint256 requiredValue, uint256 gracePeriod)`: Owner adds a new attunement requirement definition.
6.  `updateAttunementRequirement(bytes32 reqId, uint256 reqType, bytes data, uint256 requiredValue, uint256 gracePeriod)`: Owner updates an existing requirement definition.
7.  `removeAttunementRequirement(bytes32 reqId)`: Owner removes a requirement definition.
8.  `setVaultState(VaultState newState)`: Owner sets the vault's current operating state.
9.  `linkRequirementToState(bytes32 reqId, VaultState state, bool requiredInState)`: Owner links or unlinks a requirement to a specific vault state.
10. `submitAttunementProof(bytes32 reqId, bytes proofData)`: User submits proof data for a specific requirement.
11. `requestWithdrawal(uint256 amount, address token)`: User requests to withdraw a specific amount of ETH or token. Checks current attunement, state, and temporal locks. Creates a pending request.
12. `processEligiblePendingWithdrawals(uint256[] withdrawalIds)`: Can be called to process a list of pending withdrawal requests that meet eligibility criteria (attunement, state, temporal lock expiry).
13. `cancelPendingWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawalId)`: User cancels their own pending withdrawal request.
14. `setDynamicFeeParameters(uint256 baseFeeBps, uint256 stateFeeMultiplierBps)`: Owner sets parameters influencing the withdrawal fee calculation.
15. `setTemporalLock(address user, uint256 unlockTimestamp)`: Owner sets or updates a temporal lock for a specific user, preventing withdrawals before the timestamp.
