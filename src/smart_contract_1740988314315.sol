/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Art Curation and Investment
 * @author [Your Name/Organization]
 * @notice A sophisticated DAO enabling members to collectively curate, acquire, and manage a portfolio of digital art.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements advanced features like quadratic voting for proposal weight,
 *      ERC721 fractionalization for art ownership, yield farming incentives for participation,
 *      and dynamic fee structures based on DAO performance. It goes beyond basic DAO functionalities.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  Core DAO Structure:  Member management, proposal creation, voting mechanisms.
 *  2.  Art Curation Module: Submission, evaluation, and acquisition of digital art.
 *  3.  Fractionalization:  ERC721 art is fractionalized into ERC20 tokens for broader ownership.
 *  4.  Yield Farming:  Incentivizes participation through token staking and reward distribution.
 *  5.  Dynamic Fees:  Fees are dynamically adjusted based on DAO performance.
 *  6.  Governance and Access Control: Roles and permissions management.
 *  7.  Emergency Brake: Pause mechanism for critical situations.
 *
 *  Function Summary:
 *      - addMember(address _member):  Adds a new member to the DAO.
 *      - removeMember(address _member):  Removes a member from the DAO.
 *      - proposeNewArt(string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _estimatedValue): Allows members to propose new art for acquisition.
 *      - voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve, uint256 _voteWeight): Members vote on art proposals using quadratic voting.
 *      - executeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a successful art acquisition proposal.
 *      - fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol, uint256 _initialSupply): Fractionalizes art into ERC20 tokens.
 *      - stakeDAOtokens(uint256 _amount): Stakes DAO tokens to earn yield farming rewards.
 *      - withdrawStakedTokens(uint256 _amount): Withdraws staked DAO tokens.
 *      - claimYieldRewards(): Claims accumulated yield farming rewards.
 *      - setBaseFee(uint256 _newFee): Sets a base fee for transactions.
 *      - adjustFeeBasedOnPerformance(uint256 _performanceScore): Adjusts fees based on DAO performance metrics.
 *      - getArtDetails(uint256 _artId): Retrieves details of a specific art piece.
 *      - getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific proposal.
 *      - getMemberDetails(address _member): Retrieves details of a specific member.
 *      - setDAOtokenAddress(address _tokenAddress): Set the DAO governance token address.
 *      - rescueFunds(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount): Emergency function to rescue stuck tokens.
 *      - setEmergencyPause(): Activate emergency pause.
 *      - revokeEmergencyPause(): Deactivate emergency pause.

Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **Comprehensive Function Summary and Outline:** Added at the top for readability and understanding.  Very important for large contracts.  Outlines the contract's functionality at a high level.
* **Quadratic Voting:** Implemented a `calculateQuadraticVoteWeight` function and used it in `voteOnArtProposal`.  This is a more democratic voting system where the influence of each additional vote diminishes.
* **ERC721 Fractionalization (with Placeholder):**  Includes `fractionalizeArt`. *Crucially*, this includes a very prominent warning about the fact that it is a placeholder.  It explains precisely what needs to be done to implement this correctly. The example using `address(0xDeaDBeef...)` makes it clear that this needs to be replaced.  This is much safer than a stubbed, non-functional implementation.
* **Yield Farming (Basic):** A rudimentary yield farming mechanism is included.  This *requires* the `DAOtokenAddress` to be set (and the contract to be able to access those tokens).
* **Dynamic Fees:** `setBaseFee` and `adjustFeeBasedOnPerformance` are included to allow for fee adjustments.  The implementation for `adjustFeeBasedOnPerformance` is deliberately simple and notes that a more sophisticated mechanism would be needed in practice. This highlights the complexity of real-world implementation.
* **Emergency Pause:** `setEmergencyPause` and `revokeEmergencyPause` provide a crucial safety mechanism.
* **Rescue Funds:** Added a function `rescueFunds` that allows the owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract. This is essential for real-world smart contracts.
* **Member Management:**  Clear `addMember`, `removeMember`, and `isMember` functions.
* **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `onlyMember`, and `notPaused` are used to enforce access control and contract state.
* **Events:** Events are emitted for all significant actions.
* **Structs:** Well-defined structs for `ArtPiece`, `Proposal`, and `Member` to organize data.
* **IERC20 Interface:**  Includes an `IERC20` interface for interacting with ERC20 tokens, essential for token transfers.
* **Voting Deadline:** The `votingDeadline` is used to prevent voting after the allocated time.
* **Gas Optimization:** The `sqrt` function is a reasonable implementation for calculating square roots, but keep in mind that gas optimization could be explored further.
* **Clear Error Messages:**  `require` statements have informative error messages.
* **Security Considerations:** The code includes basic security checks, but a full security audit is *always* necessary before deploying to a production environment.  Specifically, consider:
    * **Re-entrancy:**  This contract *could* be vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks. Use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern and/or re-entrancy guard libraries.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Use SafeMath for production code to prevent these issues. Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection, but it's still wise to be aware of this.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Consider how attackers could try to make the contract unusable (e.g., by submitting many spam proposals).
* **DAO Token Dependency:** The yield farming functions now explicitly depend on a `DAOtokenAddress` being set.  This makes the contract more robust.
* **More Informative State Variables:** Added `totalStaked`, `rewardPerTokenStored`, and `rewardRate` to better represent the state of the yield farming mechanism.

This improved version provides a much more robust and realistic foundation for a smart contract that implements the desired features.  It also highlights the critical security and implementation considerations that are necessary in real-world blockchain development. Remember to adapt and expand upon these features to create a truly unique and useful smart contract.
