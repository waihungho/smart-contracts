The `AegisProtocol` smart contract introduces a novel approach to digital asset management on the blockchain, focusing on programmable, adaptive asset guardianship. It blends concepts from decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and simulates AI integration via an oracle pattern, alongside a unique SBT-like reputation system.

---

### **Contract Name:** `AegisProtocol`

### **Purpose:**
A decentralized, adaptive protocol for autonomous asset guardianship. Users can entrust ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets to the protocol under programmable, adaptive, and DAO-governed release conditions. The system integrates AI-driven insights via Oracles and features a unique reputation system influencing governance and system dynamics.

### **Key Concepts:**
*   **Programmable Guardianship:** Assets are held by the protocol until complex, multi-factor conditions (time, AI verification, multi-signature, reputation thresholds) are met.
*   **AI Oracle Integration (Simulated):** Conditions can be verified or influenced by insights from registered AI Oracles, providing a bridge between off-chain intelligence and on-chain logic.
*   **SBT-like Reputation System:** Participants earn non-transferable reputation scores that impact their influence in governance, eligibility for roles, and access to features. Reputation can be delegated.
*   **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** Governs protocol parameters, approves AI Oracles, manages the reputation system, and allows for collective decision-making on protocol evolution.
*   **Adaptive Dynamics:** Features like protocol fees can dynamically adjust based on network state, AI-driven economic insights, or DAO decisions.

### **Outline & Function Summary:**

**I. State Variables & Constants:**
*   `i_owner`: Immutable address of the contract deployer, serves as a fallback for emergency and initial DAO functions.
*   `paused`: Boolean flag for emergency pause mechanism.
*   `guardianships`: Mapping storing details of each entrusted asset.
*   `releaseConditions`: Mapping storing the complex conditions for asset release.
*   `aiOracles`: Mapping to track registered AI oracles and their trust scores.

*   `IAegisOracle`: A conceptual interface for external AI Oracle contracts.

**VI. Functions (Total: 25 functions):**

---

**A. Asset Guardianship (Core deposit & release logic):**

1.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount, address beneficiary, uint256 releaseConditionId)`: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the protocol, specifying the amount, target beneficiary, and a predefined release condition.
2.  `depositERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId, address beneficiary, uint256 releaseConditionId)`: Allows users to deposit ERC721 NFTs into the protocol, specifying the NFT's address, ID, target beneficiary, and a predefined release condition.
3.  `requestAssetRelease(uint256 guardianshipId)`: Initiates the process to check if the conditions for a specific guardianship are met. If so, it sets the guardianship status to `Released`.
4.  `cancelGuardianship(uint256 guardianshipId)`: Allows the original asset owner to unilaterally cancel an active guardianship and reclaim their assets, *only if* the release conditions have not yet been met.
5.  `withdrawReleasedAssets(uint256 guardianshipId)`: Allows the designated beneficiary to withdraw assets from a guardianship once its status has been set to `Released` (i.e., conditions met).
6.  `addApprovedBeneficiary(address owner, address beneficiary)`: Allows an owner to pre-approve a beneficiary for simplified, direct transfers or inheritance scenarios, outside of specific guardianship conditions.

---

**B. Release Conditions & Oracle Integration (Defining and verifying conditions):**

7.  `setReleaseCondition(uint8 conditionType, bytes calldata data)`: Defines a new, flexible release condition. The `conditionType` (e.g., Time, AI-verified, Multi-signature, Reputation Threshold) dictates how the `data` bytes are interpreted. Returns the ID of the new condition.
8.  `addAIOracle(address oracleAddress, string calldata description)`: Registers a new AI oracle contract with the protocol. This action requires DAO approval (`onlyDAO`).
9.  `removeAIOracle(address oracleAddress)`: Deregisters an existing AI oracle. This action requires DAO approval (`onlyDAO`).
10. `updateAIOracleTrustScore(uint256 oracleId, uint256 newScore)`: Adjusts the trust score of a registered AI oracle. Higher trust scores might give more weight to oracle verifications. This function requires DAO approval (`onlyDAO`).
11. `submitOracleVerification(uint256 guardianshipId, bool verificationResult, bytes calldata proof)`: Allows a registered AI Oracle to submit a boolean verification result for a specific guardianship's AI-dependent condition. A `proof` hash can be included for off-chain verification.
12. `_evaluateReleaseCondition(uint256 guardianshipId)`: An internal helper function triggered by `requestAssetRelease` and `submitOracleVerification` to check if a given guardianship's release conditions are met based on its type and data.

---

**C. Reputation (SBT-like) & Incentives (Managing user reputation and rewards):**

13. `mintAegisReputationSBT(address holder, uint256 initialScore)`: Mints a new, non-transferable reputation score for a specific user. Intended for initial assignment by the DAO or trusted parties (`onlyDAO`).
14. `updateReputationScore(address holder, uint256 newScore)`: Adjusts a user's reputation score. This can be used for positive reinforcement (e.g., successful contributions) or penalties. Requires DAO approval (`onlyDAO`).
15. `delegateReputation(address delegatee, uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to temporarily delegate a portion of their reputation influence to another address, primarily for voting in governance. The delegator retains their base score, but their voting power for relevant actions is reduced.
16. `slashReputation(address holder, uint256 amount)`: Reduces a user's reputation score as a penalty for misconduct or poor performance. Requires DAO approval (`onlyDAO`).
17. `getReputationScore(address holder)`: Returns the current base reputation score of a user. (Note: For voting power, delegated reputation would also be factored in during the `voteOnProposal` calculation, though not directly reflected in this simple getter).
18. `claimAegisRewards()`: Allows eligible participants (e.g., active voters, successful oracle reporters) to claim their accrued protocol rewards based on their positive contributions. (Actual reward calculation and token distribution logic is a placeholder).

---

**D. DAO & Governance (Protocol evolution and decision-making):**

19. `proposeAegisRuleChange(string calldata proposalURI, uint256 duration)`: Allows users with a minimum reputation score to propose changes to protocol parameters, new strategies, or other rule adjustments. The proposal is linked to an external URI (e.g., IPFS).
20. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Allows reputation holders to cast their vote on an active proposal. Voting power is weighted by the voter's (and potentially delegated) reputation score.
21. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on proposal after its voting period has ended and quorum requirements are met. The specific execution logic would depend on the proposal's content (placeholder).
22. `setDAOParameter(bytes32 parameterName, uint256 value)`: A generic function allowing the DAO to set various core protocol parameters (e.g., minimum reputation for proposals, voting durations, quorum percentages).

---

**E. Protocol Management & Emergency (Administrative and safety features):**

23. `setEmergencyPause()`: Initiates an emergency pause of critical protocol operations (e.g., asset deposits/releases). Callable by the contract owner, or via a DAO emergency proposal.
24. `releaseEmergencyPause()`: Resumes protocol operations after an emergency pause. Callable by the contract owner, or via a DAO emergency proposal.
25. `setDynamicFeeTier(uint256 tierId)`: Adjusts the current fee tier of the protocol. This mechanism allows for adaptive fees based on network conditions, AI-driven economic insights, or DAO decisions.
