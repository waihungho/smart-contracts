/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Dynamic Governance and Reputation System
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a DAO with advanced features including dynamic governance parameters,
 *      a reputation system, role-based access control, and various proposal types. It aims to be a creative
 *      and trendy example, avoiding duplication of common open-source DAO patterns by focusing on
 *      dynamic elements and reputation-driven influence.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. DAO Setup and Configuration:**
 *    - `initializeDAO(string _name, address _initialOwner)`: Initializes the DAO with a name and owner.
 *    - `updateGovernanceParameters(uint256 _quorumThreshold, uint256 _votingPeriod, uint256 _proposalThreshold)`: Updates core governance parameters.
 *
 * **2. Membership Management:**
 *    - `requestMembership()`: Allows an address to request membership.
 *    - `approveMembership(address _member)`: Allows the DAO owner or designated role to approve membership requests.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows the DAO owner or designated role to revoke membership.
 *    - `assignRole(address _member, Role _role)`: Assigns a specific role to a member.
 *    - `revokeRole(address _member, Role _role)`: Revokes a role from a member.
 *    - `getMemberDetails(address _member)`: Retrieves details of a DAO member (roles, reputation).
 *    - `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *    - `hasRole(address _account, Role _role)`: Checks if an address has a specific role.
 *
 * **3. Proposal Management & Voting:**
 *    - `createProposal(ProposalType _proposalType, string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, address _target)`: Creates a new proposal.
 *    - `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _voteOption)`: Allows members to cast votes on proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal after the voting period.
 *    - `queueProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Queues a proposal for execution (can add timelock logic later).
 *    - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the DAO owner or designated role to cancel a proposal before voting ends.
 *    - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific proposal.
 *    - `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the current state of a proposal.
 *    - `proposalThreshold()`: Returns the minimum reputation required to create a proposal.
 *
 * **4. Reputation System:**
 *    - `earnReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the DAO owner or designated role to grant reputation to a member.
 *    - `burnReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the DAO owner or designated role to remove reputation from a member.
 *    - `delegateReputation(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a member to delegate reputation to another member for voting purposes.
 *    - `withdrawDelegatedReputation(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a member to withdraw delegated reputation.
 *    - `getReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves the reputation of a member.
 *    - `getVotingPower(address _member)`: Calculates the voting power of a member based on reputation and delegation.
 *
 * **5. Treasury Management (Basic Example):**
 *    - `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit Ether into the DAO treasury.
 *    - `createTreasuryProposal(string memory _description, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Creates a proposal to spend funds from the treasury.
 *
 * **6. Utility/Helper Functions:**
 *    - `getDAOName()`: Returns the name of the DAO.
 *    - `getOwner()`: Returns the address of the DAO owner.
