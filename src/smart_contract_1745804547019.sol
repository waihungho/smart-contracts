Okay, here is a smart contract concept called the "Decentralized Autonomous Synergy Engine" (DASE). It aims to combine elements of a DAO, a dynamic parameter system, a reputation-based weighting mechanism, and collaborative "Synergy Goals" that participants can contribute to and benefit from.

The design focuses on:
1.  **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Voting power isn't just proportional to stake, but also influenced by accumulated "Reputation".
2.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Key contract variables can be adjusted *by successful proposals* themselves, making the system adaptable.
3.  **Synergy Goals:** A mechanism for defining collaborative targets (like funding specific initiatives, completing tasks) that users contribute towards and are rewarded upon completion.
4.  **Delegation:** Standard DAO feature for users to delegate their voting power.

This combination aims for a more nuanced, adaptive, and collaborative decentralized system. It avoids direct duplication of standard ERC-20/NFT or simple DAO templates by integrating these distinct mechanics.

## Decentralized Autonomous Synergy Engine (DASE)

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with dynamic parameters, reputation-weighted voting, and collaborative synergy goals.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Participants:** Users who stake `SYNERGY` tokens to join and gain influence.
*   **Reputation:** An internal score reflecting a participant's positive engagement (earned through successful proposals, goal contributions, etc.).
*   **Voting Power:** A combination of staked tokens and Reputation, determining influence in proposals.
*   **Dynamic Parameters:** Configuration variables of the contract (like proposal thresholds, voting periods) that can be changed via governance.
*   **Proposals:** Formal requests to change parameters, create goals, or trigger actions, voted on by participants.
*   **Synergy Goals:** Collaborative targets that participants contribute tokens/resources to, aiming for collective achievement and shared rewards.
*   **Delegation:** Participants can delegate their voting power to another address.

**State Variables:**

*   `synergyToken`: Address of the SYNERGY ERC20 token.
*   `participants`: Mapping of addresses to `User` structs.
*   `proposals`: Mapping of proposal IDs to `Proposal` structs.
*   `goals`: Mapping of goal IDs to `Goal` structs.
*   `parameters`: Mapping of parameter names (bytes32) to `uint256` values.
*   `delegates`: Mapping of delegator addresses to delegatee addresses.
*   Counters for proposal and goal IDs.
*   Timelock variables for unstaking and proposal execution.

**Structs:**

*   `User`: Stores staked amount, reputation, and timestamp of last unstake request.
*   `Proposal`: Stores proposal details (proposer, target function, call data, state, vote counts, etc.).
*   `Goal`: Stores goal details (creator, target contribution, current contribution, status, reward details, etc.).

**Function Summary (â‰¥ 20 functions):**

1.  **`constructor(address _synergyTokenAddress, uint256 initialMinStake, uint256 initialVotingPeriod, uint256 initialProposalThresholdStake, uint256 initialExecutionDelay, uint256 initialUnstakeDelay)`:**
    *   Initializes the contract with the SYNERGY token address and initial dynamic parameters.
2.  **`stake(uint256 amount)`:**
    *   Allows a user to stake `SYNERGY` tokens to become or increase stake as a participant. Increases staked amount and potentially voting power.
3.  **`unstakeRequest(uint256 amount)`:**
    *   Initiates an unstaking process for a specified amount. Sets an unstake timer for the user.
4.  **`processUnstake()`:**
    *   Allows a user to finalize their unstaking request *after* the unstake delay has passed. Transfers tokens back to the user.
5.  **`updateStakedAmount(uint256 newAmount)`:**
    *   Allows a participant to adjust their total staked amount (increase or decrease, respecting unstake requests).
6.  **`getUserStake(address user)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current staked amount for a user.
7.  **`getUserReputation(address user)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current reputation score for a user.
8.  **`calculateUserVotingPower(address user)`:** (View)
    *   Calculates the combined voting power (stake + reputation weighted) for a user or their delegatee.
9.  **`delegateVotingPower(address delegatee)`:**
    *   Allows a participant to delegate their voting and proposal power to another address.
10. **`undelegateVotingPower()`:**
    *   Removes the delegation setup for the calling participant.
11. **`getDelegatee(address delegator)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the address the delegator has delegated to.
12. **`getDelegator(address delegatee, uint256 index)`:** (View Helper, might be complex to list all, maybe count is better)
    *   *Alternative:* `getDelegatorCount(address delegatee)` (View) - Returns the count of users who delegated to this address. (Let's go with this for simplicity in state).
13. **`setParameter(bytes32 paramName, uint256 newValue)`:**
    *   *Internal function*, callable *only* via `executeProposal`. Allows changing a parameter value.
14. **`getParameter(bytes32 paramName)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current value of a dynamic parameter.
15. **`createProposal(bytes memory callData, string memory description)`:**
    *   Allows a participant (with sufficient stake/reputation) to create a new proposal. `callData` specifies the target function call for execution if the proposal passes (e.g., calling `setParameter`, `createGoal`, `evaluateGoalCompletion`).
16. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support)`:**
    *   Allows a participant (or their delegatee) to vote on an active proposal (support: For=1, Against=0, Abstain=2). Voting power is determined by `calculateUserVotingPower`.
17. **`queueProposal(uint256 proposalId)`:**
    *   Allows anyone to queue a successful proposal after its voting period ends. Marks the proposal for execution after a timelock.
18. **`executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`:**
    *   Allows anyone to execute a queued proposal after its timelock has passed. Executes the `callData` payload.
19. **`cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`:**
    *   Allows the proposer or potentially others under specific conditions (e.g., failed quorum) to cancel a proposal.
20. **`getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Queued, Executed).
21. **`getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`:** (View)
    *   Returns detailed information about a proposal.
22. **`getProposalVoteCount(uint256 proposalId)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current vote counts (For, Against, Abstain) for a proposal.
23. **`createGoal(uint256 targetContribution, uint256 duration, bytes memory rewardsData)`:**
    *   *Internal function*, callable *only* via `executeProposal`. Creates a new Synergy Goal with a funding target, duration, and data describing potential rewards.
24. **`contributeToGoal(uint256 goalId, uint256 amount)`:**
    *   Allows any user (participant or not) to contribute `SYNERGY` tokens towards a specific active goal's target contribution.
25. **`evaluateGoalCompletion(uint256 goalId, bool completed)`:**
    *   *Internal function*, callable *only* via `executeProposal` (triggered by a governance proposal). Marks a goal as completed or failed based on evaluation outcome (which itself could be determined by another proposal or external data fed via governance).
26. **`claimGoalRewards(uint256 goalId)`:**
    *   Allows a contributor to claim their proportional share of rewards from a successfully completed goal. Reward distribution logic depends on `rewardsData`.
27. **`getGoalDetails(uint256 goalId)`:** (View)
    *   Returns detailed information about a Synergy Goal.
28. **`getUserGoalContribution(uint256 goalId, address user)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the amount a specific user has contributed to a goal.
29. **`getGoalStatus(uint256 goalId)`:** (View)
    *   Returns the current status of a goal (Active, Completed, Failed).
30. **`getTotalStaked()`:** (View)
    *   Returns the total amount of `SYNERGY` tokens currently staked in the contract.
31. **`getParticipantCount()`:** (View)
    *   Returns the number of active participants (users with non-zero stake).
32. **`getLatestProposalId()`:** (View)
    *   Returns the ID of the most recently created proposal.
33. **`getLatestGoalId()`:** (View)
    *   Returns the ID of the most recently created goal.
