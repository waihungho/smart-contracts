 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG).
 *      This contract incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic NFT metadata, decentralized governance,
 *      artist reputation system, curated exhibitions with voting, and community-driven development fund.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Gallery Initialization & Governance:**
 *    - `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _governanceToken, uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Initializes the gallery with name, governance token address, and quorum for proposals. (Admin Only - Initial Setup)
 *    - `setGalleryGovernor(address _newGovernor)`:  Changes the gallery governor (DAO controlled). (Governor Only)
 *    - `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`:  Changes the quorum percentage for governance proposals. (Governor Only)
 *    - `setDevelopmentFundAddress(address _newFundAddress)`: Sets the address for the community development fund. (Governor Only)
 *
 * **2. Artist & Artwork Management:**
 *    - `registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistDescription, string _artistWebsite)`: Allows artists to register with the gallery. (Anyone)
 *    - `listArtwork(uint256 _artistId, string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Artists can list their artworks for sale. (Registered Artist Only)
 *    - `updateArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Artists can update the price of their listed artworks. (Artwork Owner Only)
 *    - `delistArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists can delist their artworks from the gallery. (Artwork Owner Only)
 *    - `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string _reportReason)`: Allows users to report potentially inappropriate or infringing artworks. (Anyone)
 *    - `reviewArtworkReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _isApproved)`: Gallery governors review artwork reports and take action. (Governor Only)
 *
 * **3. Dynamic NFT Metadata & Provenance:**
 *    - `getArtworkMetadataURI(uint256 _artworkId)`: Dynamically generates and returns the metadata URI for an artwork, including current ownership and gallery status. (Anyone - View)
 *    - `getArtworkProvenance(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the provenance history of an artwork (transactions, ownership changes). (Anyone - View)
 *
 * **4. Decentralized Exhibition & Curation:**
 *    - `createExhibitionProposal(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`:  Propose a new art exhibition. (Governance Token Holders)
 *    - `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Vote for or against an exhibition proposal. (Governance Token Holders)
 *    - `executeExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved exhibition proposal, creating the exhibition. (Governor Only after voting period)
 *    - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Add artworks to a specific exhibition. (Curator of the exhibition - Initially Governor, can be delegated via governance)
 *    - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Remove artworks from an exhibition. (Curator of the exhibition)
 *    - `setExhibitionCurator(uint256 _exhibitionId, address _newCurator)`: Set a specific address as the curator for an exhibition (governed by proposals). (Governor Only)
 *
 * **5. Purchasing & Revenue Sharing:**
 *    - `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase listed artworks. (Anyone)
 *    - `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their earnings from artwork sales. (Registered Artist Only)
 *    - `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Gallery governors can withdraw collected gallery fees to the development fund. (Governor Only)
 *
 * **6. Artist Reputation & Ranking (Conceptual - Can be expanded):**
 *    - `upvoteArtist(uint256 _artistId)`: Users can upvote artists to improve their reputation (Conceptual, can be expanded with voting weight, etc.). (Anyone - can be rate-limited)
 *    - `downvoteArtist(uint256 _artistId)`: Users can downvote artists (Conceptual, can be expanded with voting weight, etc.). (Anyone - can be rate-limited and require reason)
 *
 * **Events:**
 *    - `GalleryInitialized(string galleryName, address governor, address governanceToken)`
 *    - `GovernorChanged(address oldGovernor, address newGovernor)`
 *    - `QuorumPercentageChanged(uint256 oldQuorumPercentage, uint256 newQuorumPercentage)`
 *    - `DevelopmentFundAddressChanged(address oldFundAddress, address newFundAddress)`
 *    - `ArtistRegistered(uint256 artistId, address artistAddress, string artistName)`
 *    - `ArtworkListed(uint256 artworkId, uint256 artistId, string artworkTitle, uint256 initialPrice)`
 *    - `ArtworkPriceUpdated(uint256 artworkId, uint256 newPrice)`
 *    - `ArtworkDelisted(uint256 artworkId)`
 *    - `ArtworkReported(uint256 reportId, uint256 artworkId, address reporter, string reason)`
 *    - `ArtworkReportReviewed(uint256 reportId, bool isApproved, address reviewer)`
 *    - `ExhibitionProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, string title, address proposer)`
 *    - `ExhibitionProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool vote)`
 *    - `ExhibitionProposalExecuted(uint256 exhibitionId, uint256 proposalId, string title)`
 *    - `ArtworkAddedToExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId, uint256 artworkId, address curator)`
 *    - `ArtworkRemovedFromExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId, uint256 artworkId, address curator)`
 *    - `ExhibitionCuratorChanged(uint256 exhibitionId, address oldCurator, address newCurator)`
 *    - `ArtworkPurchased(uint256 artworkId, address buyer, uint256 price)`
