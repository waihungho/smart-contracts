Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several interesting, advanced, and somewhat abstract concepts, inspired by decentralized identity, complex state transitions, reputation systems, and perhaps even a touch of abstract physics metaphor (like quantum states or entanglement) applied to social/governance interactions.

We'll create a contract called `QuantumQuorum` â€“ a decentralized entity where participants (Members) have evolving traits like `ReputationIndex` and `QuantumEntanglementScore`, proposals can exist in a sort of "superposition" before collapsing to a final state, and interactions between members can create "entanglement". It will also manage a dynamic "Fluctuation Pool" of funds distributed based on these complex interactions and states.

This concept aims to be distinct from standard DAOs or token contracts.

**Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumQuorum`

**Core Concept:** A decentralized system managing member reputation, inter-member entanglement, complex proposal state transitions ("superposition" and "collapse"), and a dynamic fund distribution pool based on member traits and proposal outcomes.

**Outline:**
1.  **Pragma & Imports:** Specify Solidity version.
2.  **Errors:** Custom error definitions.
3.  **Enums:** Define states for proposals.
4.  **Structs:** Define `Member` and `Proposal` data structures.
5.  **State Variables:** Mappings and variables to store members, proposals, entanglement data, configuration, and the fluctuation pool balance.
6.  **Events:** Log important actions and state changes.
7.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state check modifiers.
8.  **Constructor:** Initialize contract with basic configuration and potentially an initial administrator/observer.
9.  **Member Management:** Functions for registering members, updating profiles, querying member data.
10. **Reputation & Entanglement:** Internal functions to update scores, external functions to trigger decay or specific interactions.
11. **Observer Role Management:** Functions to add/remove privileged "Observer" addresses (those who can trigger state transitions).
12. **Configuration:** Functions to update contract parameters.
13. **Proposal System:** Functions to create, vote on proposals.
14. **State Transition (Superposition & Collapse):** Functions to start the observation period and trigger the final "collapse" (resolution) of a proposal.
15. **Proposal Execution:** Function to execute the outcome of an approved proposal.
16. **Fluctuation Pool Management:** Functions to receive funds and distribute them based on complex logic.
17. **Query/View Functions:** Functions to read contract state.
18. **Emergency Function:** A function for drastic state reset by Observers.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address[] initialObservers)`: Initializes the contract, sets initial observers.
2.  `registerMember()`: Allows an address to register as a member, initializing their scores.
3.  `addObserver(address _observer)`: Grants the observer role (restricted).
4.  `removeObserver(address _observer)`: Revokes the observer role (restricted).
5.  `updateConfig(uint256 _observationPeriod, uint256 _decayRatePermille, uint256 _minQESForProposal, uint256 _minReputationToVote)`: Updates core configuration parameters (restricted).
6.  `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _outcomeData, uint256 _requiredQESThreshold, uint256 _requiredReputationThreshold)`: Creates a new proposal. Requires minimum QES and Reputation. Enters `SuperpositionPending`.
7.  `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote on a proposal. Vote weight is influenced by member's current Reputation and QES. Affects proposal's potential outcome probabilities.
8.  `delegateQuantumVote(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount)`: Delegates a portion of one's potential future vote weight (abstract, linked to QES/Reputation) to another member, increasing their entanglement score.
9.  `revokeQuantumVoteDelegation(address _delegatee)`: Revokes previously delegated vote weight.
10. `startObservationPeriod(uint256 _proposalId)`: An observer triggers the observation phase for a proposal. Transitions from `SuperpositionPending` to `MeasuringVotes`.
11. `observeAndCollapse(uint256 _proposalId)`: Triggers the final resolution of a proposal after the observation period. Aggregates weighted votes, determines final state (`CollapseApproved` or `CollapseRejected`), updates member scores based on outcome alignment, and potentially triggers a mini-distribution from the Fluctuation Pool.
12. `executeCollapsedProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes the `outcomeData` of a proposal if it reached the `CollapseApproved` state.
13. `contributeToFluctuationPool()`: Allows anyone to send Ether (or native currency) to the contract's fluctuation pool.
14. `distributeFluctuationPool(uint256 _amount)`: Distributes a specified amount from the fluctuation pool based on a formula involving member's recent activity, Reputation, QES, and successful proposal participation (restricted, e.g., to Observers or automated).
15. `decayDecoherence()`: A function that can be called by anyone (perhaps incentivized) to trigger the decay of Reputation and QES for inactive members, and reduce general entanglement scores.
16. `triggerEntanglementBoost(address _member1, address _member2)`: A function requiring both members to consent (e.g., via separate calls within a time window or signature verification - simplified here to require calls by both within tolerance) to mutually increase their entanglement score.
17. `getMemberProfile(address _member)`: Views a member's isActive status, ReputationIndex, and QuantumEntanglementScore.
18. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Views the current state and key details of a proposal.
19. `getEntanglementScore(address _member1, address _member2)`: Views the entanglement score between two specific members.
20. `calculateProjectedOutcome(uint256 _proposalId)`: A view function that estimates the likely outcome of a proposal based on current vote weights, before it's collapsed.
21. `emergencyDecoherenceCascade()`: A drastic measure callable by observers to significantly reduce all Reputation, QES, and entanglement scores across the board in an emergency.
22. `getFluctuationPoolBalance()`: Views the current balance of the fluctuation pool.
23. `getActiveProposals()`: Views a list of proposals that are currently in `SuperpositionPending` or `MeasuringVotes` state.
