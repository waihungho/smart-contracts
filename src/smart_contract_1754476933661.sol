This smart contract, named "Elysium Nexus," is designed as an advanced, adaptive, and reputation-weighted decentralized capital allocation and strategic optimization platform. It aims to create a self-improving financial ecosystem where capital is dynamically re-allocated based on aggregated market insights, risk assessments, and performance metrics, all while being governed by participants whose influence is weighted by their on-chain reputation and verified off-chain contributions.

It introduces concepts like:
*   **Adaptive Capital Allocation:** Funds are not statically held but dynamically moved between whitelisted "strategies" (which could represent internal sub-pools or external DeFi protocols) based on real-time data and governance.
*   **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Voting power and access to features are directly tied to a user's on-chain reputation score, which can be earned through various positive interactions and participation, and can decay over time.
*   **Proof of Contribution (PoC) Mechanism (Simulated):** Users can submit "proofs" (e.g., market sentiment analysis, risk assessments) that, if validated (simulated for on-chain cost), contribute to their reputation and influence adaptive parameters.
*   **Dynamic Fee Structures & Interest Rates:** Parameters can adjust based on the system's health, utilization, and aggregated insights.
*   **Sybil Resistance Integration (Conceptual):** A conceptual link for integrating external Sybil resistance proofs to further enhance reputation integrity.
*   **Emergency Circuit Breakers:** Mechanisms for the DAO or a trusted multi-sig to pause critical operations in case of an attack or exploit.

### **Function Summary:**

#### **Core Infrastructure:**
1.  **`constructor(address _initialToken, address _initialOracle)`**: Initializes the contract with the primary ERC20 token and a conceptual oracle address.
2.  **`setGovernor(address _newGovernor)`**: Sets a new address for the DAO Governor, who has elevated control over critical parameters.

#### **Capital Management Module:**
3.  **`depositFunds(uint256 amount)`**: Allows users to deposit the primary ERC20 token into the Elysium Nexus pool.
4.  **`withdrawFunds(uint256 amount)`**: Allows users to withdraw their deposited funds, subject to pool liquidity and any lockups.
5.  **`registerExternalStrategy(address _strategyAddress, uint256 _riskScore, uint256 _performanceScore)`**: Whitelists a new external strategy (e.g., another DeFi protocol, a vault) that Elysium Nexus can allocate capital to, along with initial risk and performance scores.
6.  **`deregisterExternalStrategy(address _strategyAddress)`**: Removes an external strategy from the whitelist, preventing further allocations to it.
7.  **`getStrategyAllocation(address _strategyAddress)`**: Returns the current amount of funds allocated to a specific external strategy.

#### **Adaptive Allocation & Optimization Module:**
8.  **`initiateDynamicAllocationOptimization()`**: Triggered by the Governor or a governance vote, this function re-evaluates and initiates a re-allocation of funds among registered strategies based on current risk/performance scores and market insights.
9.  **`executeAllocationTransfer(address _fromStrategy, address _toStrategy, uint256 _amount)`**: Executes the actual transfer of funds between internal pools or external strategies based on the optimization outcome. (Assumes _fromStrategy 0x0 for initial allocation).

#### **Reputation System Module:**
10. **`stakeForReputationBoost(uint256 amount)`**: Allows users to stake primary tokens to temporarily boost their reputation score.
11. **`unstakeReputationBoost()`**: Allows users to unstake their tokens and remove the reputation boost.
12. **`getReputationScore(address _user)`**: Returns the current reputation score of a specific user.
13. **`penalizeReputation(address _user, uint256 _penaltyAmount)`**: Allows the Governor to manually penalize a user's reputation for malicious behavior (e.g., failed PoC submissions, governance attacks).
14. **`decayReputation(address _user)`**: (Internal/Periodically Called) Decays a user's reputation over time if they are inactive or to encourage continuous engagement.

#### **Proof of Contribution (PoC) & Oracle Integration Module:**
15. **`submitOffChainDataProof(string memory _dataType, bytes32 _proofHash, bytes memory _additionalData)`**: Allows users to submit a cryptographic proof (e.g., ZKP hash) of an off-chain data contribution (e.g., market sentiment, risk assessment).
16. **`verifyAndIntegrateData(string memory _dataType, bytes32 _proofHash, address _contributor)`**: (Internal) Simulates the verification of an off-chain data proof and integrates it into the system's aggregated insights, rewarding the contributor with reputation.
17. **`getAggregatedMarketSentiment()`**: Returns the current aggregated market sentiment score derived from validated off-chain data proofs.
18. **`updateDynamicInterestRate()`**: Adjusts the dynamic interest rate for depositors based on pool utilization and aggregated market insights.

#### **Reputation-Weighted Governance Module:**
19. **`proposeParameterChange(string memory _description, uint256 _proposalType, uint256 _newValue, address _targetAddress)`**: Allows users with sufficient reputation to propose changes to system parameters (e.g., risk thresholds, allocation weights).
20. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _voteFor)`**: Allows users to cast their reputation-weighted vote on an active proposal.
21. **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes a proposal if it has passed and its voting period has ended.
22. **`delegateReputation(address _delegatee)`**: Allows users to delegate their reputation-weighted voting power to another address.

#### **Risk Management & Emergency Module:**
23. **`triggerEmergencyPause()`**: Allows the Governor or a pre-defined multi-sig to pause critical contract functions in an emergency.
24. **`liftEmergencyPause()`**: Lifts the emergency pause.
25. **`liquidateUnderperformingStrategy(address _strategyAddress, address _redeemToStrategy)`**: Allows the Governor or a governance vote to withdraw funds from an underperforming strategy and re-allocate them to a more secure or performing one.

#### **Incentive & Reward Module:**
26. **`claimReputationRewards()`**: Allows users to claim accumulated token rewards based on their reputation score and consistent positive participation.
27. **`distributePerformanceFees()`**: (Internal/Governor-triggered) Distributes a portion of the profits generated by successful strategies back to depositors and reputation holders.
