/**
 * @title Adaptive DAO: A Dynamic and Feature-Rich Decentralized Autonomous Organization
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a sophisticated DAO with advanced features beyond typical governance models.
 * It focuses on adaptability, community engagement, and innovative mechanisms for decision-making and resource management.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Governance Functions:**
 *   - `createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes memory _data)`: Allows members to create proposals of different types (general, parameter change, role change).
 *   - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _voteOption)`: Allows members to cast votes on active proposals.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes based on the defined quorum and voting duration.
 *   - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer to cancel a proposal before it's executed (with conditions).
 *
 * **2. Membership & Reputation System:**
 *   - `requestMembership()`: Allows anyone to request membership to the DAO.
 *   - `approveMembership(address _member)`: Governor role function to approve pending membership requests.
 *   - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Governor role function to revoke membership from an existing member.
 *   - `assignReputation(address _member, uint256 _reputationPoints)`: Governor role function to assign reputation points to members based on contributions.
 *   - `burnReputation(address _member, uint256 _reputationPoints)`: Governor role function to burn reputation points from members for negative actions.
 *   - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Public function to view a member's reputation points.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic Parameter Management:**
 *   - `setParameter_VotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Governor role function to change the voting duration for proposals.
 *   - `setParameter_QuorumPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage)`: Governor role function to change the quorum percentage required for proposal approval.
 *   - `setParameter_MembershipFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Governor role function to change the membership fee (if applicable).
 *   - `getParameter_VotingDuration()`: Public function to view the current voting duration.
 *   - `getParameter_QuorumPercentage()`: Public function to view the current quorum percentage.
 *   - `getParameter_MembershipFee()`: Public function to view the current membership fee.
 *
 * **4. Advanced Voting Mechanisms:**
 *   - `enableQuadraticVoting(bool _enabled)`: Governor role function to toggle quadratic voting for proposals.
 *   - `voteQuadratic(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _voteOption, uint256 _voteWeight)`: Allows members to cast quadratic votes, where vote cost increases quadratically with weight.
 *   - `enableConvictionVoting(bool _enabled)`: Governor role function to toggle conviction voting (not implemented in detail here, concept outlined).
 *
 * **5. Treasury & Token Management (Simplified):**
 *   - `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit funds (ETH) into the DAO treasury.
 *   - `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Governor role function to withdraw funds from the treasury to a specified recipient.
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Public function to view the current treasury balance.
 *
 * **6. Role-Based Access Control:**
 *   - `defineRole(bytes32 _roleName)`: Governor role function to define new custom roles within the DAO.
 *   - `assignRoleToMember(address _member, bytes32 _roleName)`: Governor role function to assign a defined role to a member.
 *   - `removeRoleFromMember(address _member, bytes32 _roleName)`: Governor role function to remove a role from a member.
 *   - `hasRole(address _member, bytes32 _roleName)`: Public function to check if a member has a specific role.
 *
 * **7. Event Emission for Transparency:**
 *   - Emits events for proposal creation, voting, execution, membership changes, parameter updates, and role assignments.
