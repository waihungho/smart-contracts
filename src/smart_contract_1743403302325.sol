/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation & Task Marketplace Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - No Actual Author)
 * @dev A smart contract that implements a dynamic reputation system combined with a task marketplace.
 *      It allows users to build reputation by completing tasks and stake tokens to enhance their profile.
 *      Reputation is dynamically adjusted based on task performance and community feedback.
 *      The marketplace supports task creation, bidding, acceptance, completion, review, and dispute resolution.
 *
 * Contract Features:
 * 1. Dynamic Reputation System:
 *    - Reputation points awarded for task completion and positive reviews.
 *    - Reputation points deducted for negative reviews and unresolved disputes.
 *    - Reputation decay mechanism for inactivity.
 *    - Reputation tiers (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) unlocking features.
 *
 * 2. Task Marketplace:
 *    - Task creation with detailed descriptions, deadlines, and rewards.
 *    - Task bidding system where users can propose their price and approach.
 *    - Task acceptance by the task poster, assigning it to a bidder.
 *    - Task completion submission and review process.
 *    - Dispute resolution mechanism with voting by stakers.
 *
 * 3. Reputation Staking:
 *    - Users can stake tokens to boost their reputation visibility and bidding priority.
 *    - Staked tokens can be slashed for severe negative actions (e.g., repeated task failures, malicious behavior).
 *    - Staking tiers with increasing benefits.
 *
 * 4. Community Governance (Simple):
 *    - Stakers have voting power in dispute resolution.
 *    - Potential future governance extensions for contract upgrades or parameter changes.
 *
 * 5. Advanced Features:
 *    - Skill-based task matching (future extension).
 *    - NFT reputation badges (future extension).
 *    - On-chain reputation history and analytics.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * [Reputation Management]
 * 1.  getReputation(address user) public view returns (uint256): Returns the reputation score of a user.
 * 2.  increaseReputation(address user, uint256 amount) internal: Increases a user's reputation (internal use).

 * 4.  decayReputation() public:  Applies reputation decay to all users (can be triggered periodically).
 * 5.  getUserReputationTier(address user) public view returns (string memory): Returns the reputation tier of a user.
 *
 * [Task Marketplace]
 * 6.  createTask(string memory description, uint256 reward, uint256 deadline) public payable: Creates a new task.
 * 7.  bidOnTask(uint256 taskId, string memory proposal, uint256 bidAmount) public payable: Allows users to bid on a task.
 * 8.  acceptBid(uint256 taskId, address bidder) public: Task poster accepts a bid, assigning the task.
 * 9.  submitTaskCompletion(uint256 taskId, string memory submissionDetails) public: Task assignee submits task completion.
 * 10. reviewTaskCompletion(uint256 taskId, bool isSatisfied, string memory reviewComment) public: Task poster reviews and rates the completion.
 * 11. raiseDispute(uint256 taskId, string memory disputeReason) public:  Raises a dispute for a task completion.
 * 12. resolveDispute(uint256 taskId, bool taskCompleted) public onlyStakers: Resolves a dispute by staker vote.
 * 13. getTaskDetails(uint256 taskId) public view returns (Task memory): Returns details of a specific task.
 * 14. getOpenTasks() public view returns (uint256[] memory): Returns a list of IDs of currently open tasks.
 *
 * [Reputation Staking]
 * 15. stakeForReputation() public payable: Allows users to stake tokens to enhance their reputation.
 * 16. unstakeReputation(uint256 amount) public: Allows users to unstake tokens (with potential cooldown).

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic Reputation System:**
    *   **Reputation Decay:**  Encourages continuous engagement by implementing a decay mechanism for inactivity, simulating real-world reputation that can diminish over time if not maintained.
    *   **Reputation Tiers:** Creates a progression system, where higher reputation unlocks more features or benefits within the platform (though not fully implemented with feature unlocks in this example, the tier function is there as a basis).
    *   **Reputation as a Core Platform Element:** Reputation is not just a score; it's integrated into staking, dispute resolution, and potentially task matching in future extensions.

2.  **Task Marketplace with Advanced Features:**
    *   **Bidding System:**  Allows for more flexible pricing and negotiation compared to fixed-price tasks.
    *   **Dispute Resolution with Staker Voting:** Decentralizes dispute resolution by leveraging the community of stakers, adding a layer of governance and fairness.
    *   **Task Status Tracking:**  Detailed task statuses provide transparency and manage the task lifecycle effectively.

3.  **Reputation Staking:**
    *   **Staking for Enhanced Visibility:**  Staking is not just for governance but directly benefits users by potentially increasing their visibility in the marketplace and bidding priority (not explicitly implemented in bidding logic here, but conceptually intended).
    *   **Staking as a Quality Signal:**  Users who stake are more likely to be invested in the platform's success and maintain good behavior, as their staked tokens are at risk (slashing mechanism).
    *   **Community Governance Participation:** Stakers are given voting rights in dispute resolution, representing a basic form of community governance.

4.  **On-Chain Task and Reputation Data:**  All task details, reputation scores, and staking information are stored directly on the blockchain, providing transparency and immutability.

**Further Potential Extensions (Beyond the 20 Functions - Ideas for Growth):**

*   **Skill-Based Task Matching:**  Implement a system to categorize tasks by skills and match them with users possessing those skills based on their profile or past task history.
*   **NFT Reputation Badges:**  Issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as reputation badges representing different tiers or achievements, adding a collectible and visual aspect to reputation.
*   **Advanced Governance:**  Expand the governance model to allow stakers to vote on contract parameters, feature upgrades, or even manage a community treasury.
*   **Decentralized Oracles for External Data:** Integrate decentralized oracles to bring in external data relevant to tasks (e.g., real-world event verification, data feeds for tasks requiring external information).
*   **Payment in Multiple Tokens:**  Allow task posters to offer rewards in various ERC20 tokens, increasing flexibility and adoption.
*   **Escrow Functionality:**  Implement more robust escrow mechanisms for task rewards to further enhance trust and security.
*   **Reputation-Based Access Control:**  Use reputation tiers to grant access to certain features or levels of the platform.
*   **Task Categories and Filtering:**  Implement task categorization and filtering to improve task discovery and organization.
*   **Direct Messaging/Communication System:**  Integrate a basic on-chain or off-chain messaging system for task posters and assignees to communicate directly.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security:** This is a conceptual contract and has not been rigorously audited for security vulnerabilities. In a production environment, thorough security audits are essential.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract is written for clarity and demonstration of concepts, not for extreme gas optimization.  Real-world contracts often require significant gas optimization.
*   **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  While `require` statements are used, more comprehensive error handling and consideration of edge cases would be needed for a production-ready contract.
*   **Complexity:** This contract is more complex than basic token contracts.  Proper testing and documentation are crucial for maintainability and understanding.
*   **Scalability:**  Directly iterating through all tasks or users for reputation decay or staker lists (as done in `decayReputation`, `getStakers`, `getStakerCount`) can become inefficient as the number of tasks and users grows.  More scalable data structures and indexing methods would be needed for a large-scale application.

This example aims to provide a creative and advanced starting point. You can further develop and customize it based on specific requirements and innovative ideas.
