/**
 * @title Skill-Based Decentralized Autonomous Organization (SkillDAO)
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a Skill-Based DAO with advanced features like dynamic membership tiers,
 *      skill-based task assignments, reputation system, and NFT-based membership representation.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1.  Membership Management:**
 *     - `requestMembership()`: Allows users to request membership to the DAO.
 *     - `approveMembership(address _member)`: Admin function to approve membership requests.
 *     - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Admin function to revoke membership.
 *     - `getMemberDetails(address _member)`: Returns detailed information about a member.
 *     - `upgradeMembershipTier(address _member, uint8 _tier)`: Admin function to upgrade a member's tier.
 *     - `setMembershipNFTContract(address _nftContract)`: Admin function to set the NFT contract for membership NFTs.
 *
 * **2.  Governance & Proposals:**
 *     - `submitProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Members can submit proposals with calldata for execution.
 *     - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on proposals.
 *     - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Admin function to execute a passed proposal.
 *     - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific proposal.
 *     - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Admin function to cancel a proposal before voting ends.
 *     - `setVotingQuorum(uint8 _quorumPercentage)`: Admin function to set the voting quorum percentage.
 *     - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Admin function to set the voting duration in blocks.
 *
 * **3.  Skill & Task Management:**
 *     - `registerSkill(string memory _skillName)`: Members can register their skills.
 *     - `addTask(string memory _taskName, string memory _taskDescription, string[] memory _requiredSkills, uint256 _reward)`: Admin function to add a task requiring specific skills.
 *     - `claimTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Members with required skills can claim tasks.
 *     - `submitTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId, string memory _proofOfWork)`: Members submit proof of work for completed tasks.
 *     - `approveTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId)`: Admin function to approve task completion and reward the member.
 *     - `getTaskDetails(uint256 _taskId)`: Returns details of a specific task.
 *     - `getMemberSkills(address _member)`: Returns the skills registered by a member.
 *
 * **4.  Reputation System (Example - Basic Integer Reputation):**
 *     - `updateMemberReputation(address _member, int256 _reputationChange)`: Admin function to manually adjust member reputation.
 *     - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Returns the current reputation of a member.
 *
 * **5.  Treasury Management (Basic - Direct Contract Balance):**
 *     - `depositFunds() payable`:  Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
 *     - `requestWithdrawal(uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Members can request withdrawals (requires admin approval in a real-world scenario, simplified here).
 *     - `approveWithdrawal(uint256 _withdrawalId)`: Admin function to approve a withdrawal request (simplified for this example).
 *     - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the DAO treasury.
 *
 * **6.  Membership NFT Integration (Example - Basic ERC721):**
 *     - `mintMembershipNFT(address _recipient)`: Admin function to mint a membership NFT for a member.
 *     - `getMembershipNFTContract()`: Returns the address of the configured membership NFT contract.
 *
 * **7. Utility Functions:**
 *     - `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause core contract functionalities.
 *     - `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to unpause the contract.
 *     - `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAO.
 *     - `isAdmin(address _account)`: Checks if an address is an admin.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Skill-Based DAO:** This contract centers around the concept of a DAO where contributions and tasks are organized based on member skills. This is a more nuanced approach than simple token-weighted DAOs.

2.  **Dynamic Membership Tiers:**  The `Member` struct includes a `tier` field, allowing for tiered membership.  This could be used to grant different levels of access, voting power, or task eligibility based on tier.  The `upgradeMembershipTier` function demonstrates this.

3.  **Skill Registry:**  Members can register their skills using `registerSkill`. Tasks can be defined with `requiredSkills`. This enables skill-based task assignments and filtering.

4.  **Task Management System:** The contract includes functions to `addTask`, `claimTask`, `submitTaskCompletion`, and `approveTaskCompletion`.  This provides a basic framework for managing projects and contributions within the DAO.

5.  **Reputation System:**  A basic integer-based reputation system is included (`updateMemberReputation`, `getMemberReputation`). Reputation could be used for various purposes, such as influencing voting power, task assignments, or access to certain DAO resources.

6.  **Proposal Execution with Calldata:**  The `submitProposal` function takes `_calldata` as input. When a proposal passes and is executed using `executeProposal`, this `calldata` is used to make a `call` to the contract itself.  This allows proposals to trigger arbitrary state changes within the contract, making the DAO more dynamic and powerful.  **Important Security Note:**  Executing arbitrary calldata is a security risk and should be handled with extreme caution in a production environment.  Input validation and careful design are crucial.

7.  **Membership NFT Integration:** The contract allows setting an external ERC721 NFT contract address (`setMembershipNFTContract`).  Upon membership approval, an NFT can be minted (`mintMembershipNFT`) and burned upon revocation (`burnMembershipNFT`). This adds a trendy element and potential utility for membership (e.g., visual representation, access to external platforms).

8.  **Voting Quorum and Duration:** The contract allows setting the `votingQuorumPercentage` and `votingDurationInBlocks`, providing flexibility in governance parameters.

9.  **Pausable Functionality:**  The contract inherits from `Pausable`, allowing the owner to pause and unpause core functionalities in case of emergency or for upgrades.

10. **Event Emission:**  Events are emitted for important actions throughout the contract, making it easier to track activity and integrate with off-chain systems.

11. **Access Control Modifiers:**  `onlyOwner`, `onlyMember`, `onlyAdmin`, `onlyProposalState`, `onlyTaskState` modifiers are used to enforce access control and state transitions, enhancing security and clarity.

12. **Treasury Management:** Basic `depositFunds`, `requestWithdrawal`, and `approveWithdrawal` functionalities are included for managing DAO funds.

13. **Utility Functions:**  `isMember`, `isAdmin`, `isPendingMember` are utility functions to check member status and roles.

**Important Notes and Further Development:**

*   **Security:** This is an example contract. In a real-world scenario, thorough security audits are absolutely essential.  Be particularly careful with the `executeProposal` function and handling of calldata.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This contract is not heavily optimized for gas. For production, consider gas optimization techniques.
*   **Scalability:**  Some functions, like `getActiveMemberCount` and `getMemberAddresses`, are inefficient for large DAOs.  For scalability, you would need to use more efficient data structures and indexing methods.
*   **Voting Logic:** The voting logic is very basic.  For more advanced governance, consider implementing weighted voting, quadratic voting, or other voting mechanisms.  The `hasVoted` function is currently a placeholder and needs a proper implementation in a real contract (e.g., using a mapping to track votes).
*   **Reputation System Expansion:** The reputation system is very basic.  You could expand it to be more dynamic, algorithmically driven, and tied to specific actions within the DAO (e.g., task completion quality, proposal contributions, positive feedback).
*   **Task Reward System:**  The task reward is currently just native tokens.  You could expand this to use other tokens, NFTs, or reputation points as rewards.
*   **NFT Integration Enhancement:** The NFT integration is basic. You could add more complex utility to the membership NFTs, such as access to gated content or features, voting power boosts, etc.
*   **Error Handling and Input Validation:**  While `require` statements are used, more robust error handling and input validation could be added.
*   **Off-Chain Integration:**  A real-world DAO would likely require significant off-chain components for UI, task management, communication, and more complex governance processes.

This SkillDAO contract provides a foundation and many ideas for building a more advanced and creative decentralized organization. Remember to always prioritize security and thorough testing when developing smart contracts for real-world use.
