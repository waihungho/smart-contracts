Okay, here is a design and implementation for a complex smart contract called `DecentralizedAutonomousCreatorGuild`. This contract aims to be a hub for digital creators, combining elements of a DAO, reputation system, treasury management, project funding, and curation, with hooks for dynamic NFTs and flexible governance.

It avoids directly copying standard OpenZeppelin contracts or common DAO templates by implementing core mechanics (like governance, reputation, roles) from scratch using fundamental Solidity principles.

## Decentralized Autonomous Creator Guild (DACG) Smart Contract Outline

**Theme:** A decentralized organization for managing a community of digital creators, funding projects, and curating work based on member reputation and governance.

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Membership:** Application and admission process, non-transferable membership status tied to reputation.
*   **Reputation:** Earned through contributions and participation, used for voting weight and privileges. Can be delegated.
*   **Treasury:** Manages Ether and approved ERC-20 tokens deposited by members or external sources. Funds projects via governance.
*   **Governance:** Proposal system with reputation-weighted voting. Supports various proposal types (funding, rule changes, member actions, project actions, treasury management).
*   **Projects & Curation:** Members can register projects, request funding, and submit projects for curation by the guild (via governance).
*   **Roles:** Specific administrative roles granted via governance.
*   **Dynamic NFT Hook:** Conceptually links member reputation/status to external dynamic Member NFTs.

**Key Data Structures:**
*   `Member`: Stores member address, status, reputation, delegated reputation, and projects created.
*   `Project`: Stores project details, creator, status, and funding requests.
*   `Proposal`: Stores proposal details, type, state, voting results (reputation weighted), and execution data.
*   `MemberStatus`, `ProposalState`, `ProposalType`, `ProjectStatus` Enums.

## Function Summary

This contract includes the following functions, providing a wide range of capabilities (more than 20):

**Membership Management (7 functions)**
1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the guild with an owner and sets initial parameters.
2.  `applyForMembership(string calldata _motivation)`: Allows anyone to submit an application to join the guild.
3.  `admitMember(address _applicant)`: Callable by authorized roles/governance to admit a pending applicant, minting their initial reputation.
4.  `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Callable by governance to revoke a member's status, penalizing reputation.
5.  `resignMembership()`: Allows a member to voluntarily resign, incurring a reputation penalty.
6.  `isMember(address _addr) view`: Checks if an address is currently an active member.
7.  `getMemberInfo(address _addr) view`: Retrieves detailed information about a member (status, reputation, etc.).

**Reputation System (5 functions)**
8.  `assignReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Callable by authorized roles/governance to increase a member's reputation.
9.  `penalizeReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Callable by authorized roles/governance to decrease a member's reputation.
10. `getReputation(address _member) view`: Gets the current reputation score of a member.
11. `delegateReputation(address _delegatee)`: Allows a member to delegate their voting power based on reputation to another member.
12. `undelegateReputation()`: Allows a member to revoke their reputation delegation.

**Treasury Management (5 functions)**
13. `depositEther() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit Ether into the guild treasury.
14. `depositERC20(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Allows anyone to deposit an approved ERC-20 token into the treasury (requires approval first).
15. `getGuildTreasuryBalanceEther() view`: Gets the current Ether balance of the treasury.
16. `getGuildTreasuryBalanceERC20(address _token) view`: Gets the current balance of an approved ERC-20 token in the treasury.
17. `addApprovedERC20(address _token)`: Callable by governance to approve a new ERC-20 token for deposits and funding proposals.

**Project Management & Curation (4 functions)**
18. `registerProject(bytes32 _projectId, string calldata _metadataURI)`: Allows an active member to register a new project identifier (e.g., an NFT token ID or unique hash) with metadata.
19. `submitProjectForCuration(bytes32 _projectId)`: Allows a member to submit one of their registered projects for consideration in a curated showcase (requires governance action later).
20. `getMemberProjects(address _member) view`: Lists the project IDs registered by a specific member.
21. `getShowcasedProjects() view`: Lists the project IDs currently marked as showcased by the guild.

**Governance System (7 functions)**
22. `createProposal(uint256 _type, bytes calldata _details, string calldata _description)`: Allows a member with sufficient reputation to create a governance proposal of a specific type (funding, parameter change, member action, etc.), including encoded details.
23. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows a member (or their delegatee) to cast a reputation-weighted vote on an active proposal.
24. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows anyone to execute a proposal that has passed its voting period and met the required thresholds.
25. `getProposal(uint256 _proposalId) view`: Retrieves full details of a specific proposal.
26. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId) view`: Gets the current state of a proposal.
27. `getVotingParameters() view`: Returns the current voting period, required reputation for proposals, and quorum/threshold parameters.
28. `setGuildParameter(bytes32 _paramName, uint256 _newValue)`: Callable *only* via a successful `SetParameter` governance proposal to update key guild parameters. (Internal execution logic of a proposal).

**Roles & Permissions (2 functions)**
29. `grantRole(bytes32 _role, address _member)`: Callable *only* via a successful `GrantRole` governance proposal to assign a specific role to a member.
30. `revokeRole(bytes32 _role, address _member)`: Callable *only* via a successful `RevokeRole` governance proposal to remove a specific role from a member.

**Advanced/Utility (3 functions)**
31. `setMemberNFTContract(address _nftContract)`: Callable *only* via a successful `SetMemberNFT` governance proposal to link an external Member NFT contract address. (Conceptual hook for dynamic NFTs updated off-chain or by keepers based on reputation/status).
32. `withdrawAccidentalEther(uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`: Callable *only* via a successful `EmergencyWithdrawEther` governance proposal for recovering Ether sent accidentally (e.g., not via `depositEther`).
33. `withdrawAccidentalERC20(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`: Callable *only* via a successful `EmergencyWithdrawERC20` governance proposal for recovering ERC-20s sent accidentally.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Design Choices:**

1.  **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Voting power is directly tied to a member's `reputation`, not just a 1-member-1-vote or token holding. Reputation is earned, not bought (in this design), making it more resistant to plutocracy than simple token-based voting.
2.  **Reputation Delegation:** Members can delegate their voting power, allowing passive members to still contribute to governance through a trusted representative.
3.  **Diverse Proposal Types:** The `createProposal` and `executeProposal` functions are designed to handle a variety of actions via an `enum` and encoded `bytes details`, making the DAO flexible without needing a new function for every possible action. This is a common, but flexible, DAO pattern.
4.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:** Key governance parameters (voting period, quorum, majority, proposal threshold) can be *changed* via governance itself (`SetParameter` proposal), allowing the DAO to evolve its own rules.
5.  **Integrated Treasury:** The contract directly holds and manages both Ether and approved ERC-20 tokens, simplifying funding and distribution processes.
6.  **Approved ERC-20 List:** Controls which tokens the DAO treasury interacts with, managed via governance.
7.  **Project Lifecycle & Curation:** Provides a basic framework for members to register projects, request funding, and submit for guild recognition (`ShowcaseProject` proposal type).
8.  **Role-Based Actions:** Specific administrative actions (like admitting members, assigning reputation) are protected by roles, which are themselves assigned via governance, decentralizing these powers over time.
9.  **Non-Transferable Membership (SBT-like):** While not a full Soulbound Token implementation, the `MemberStatus` and reputation are tied to the member's address and not transferable, aligning with the concept of identity and contribution within the guild. The `memberNFTContract` is a hook for an *external* contract that could represent this status visually or functionally as an NFT, which could be dynamic based on the on-chain reputation/status.
10. **Emergency Withdrawal:** Includes specific, governance-controlled mechanisms to recover funds accidentally sent to the contract, which is a good safety feature for DAOs.
11. **Efficiency Considerations:** While designed for functionality, some areas (like iterating `activeMembersList` or `getApprovedERC20s`) are noted as potentially inefficient for very large-scale usage and would require more advanced data structures (like iterable mappings) in a production environment.
12. **No Open Source Duplication (Core Logic):** The reputation, delegation, role management, and governance proposal/execution logic are custom implemented, avoiding inheritance or direct use of libraries like OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` or `Governor` to meet the specific constraint. It uses standard ERC20/ERC721 *interfaces* to interact with tokens, which is necessary for standard token interactions.

This contract provides a robust foundation for a decentralized creator guild with advanced features beyond a simple multi-sig or basic token DAO.
