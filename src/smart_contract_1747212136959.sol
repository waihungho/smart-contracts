Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Quantum Vault". It incorporates several advanced concepts like conditional releases based on external data (simulated oracle), state-dependent behavior, timelocks, batch operations, and more, aiming for over 20 distinct functions while avoiding direct copies of standard open-source templates like simple ERC20/ERC721 vaults or basic multisigs.

We will simulate external dependencies like oracles and randomness for demonstration purposes to keep the code self-contained.

/**
 * @title QuantumVault
 * @dev A versatile vault contract supporting ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens.
 *      It features advanced functionalities including:
 *      - Timelocked withdrawals.
 *      - Conditional releases based on simulated external data (oracle price, block number).
 *      - A 'Quantum State' mechanism that modifies withdrawal behavior.
 *      - Batch operations.
 *      - Access control with Owner and Manager roles.
 *      - Pausable mechanism.
 *      - Simulated randomness affecting state.
 *      - Conditional NFT transfer based on simulated traits.
 *      It is designed to be a creative exploration of combining various on-chain concepts.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vault:** Handles ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens within a single contract (using `ERC721Holder` from OpenZeppelin for ERC721 compliance).
2.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Uses `owner` and `manager` roles with distinct permissions, adding a layer beyond simple `Ownable`.
3.  **Pausable:** Standard but essential for security, allowing operations to be halted in emergencies (except emergency withdrawals).
4.  **Timelock Mechanism:** Allows scheduling asset releases based purely on time, a common DeFi primitive but implemented here for mixed asset types. Uses unique IDs (`bytes32`) generated on-chain.
5.  **Conditional Release Mechanism:** Assets can be locked and released only when a specific, predefined *on-chain or simulated* condition is met.
    *   Uses an `enum` (`ConditionType`) and `bytes` data to make conditions somewhat extensible.
    *   Includes conditions based on a *simulated* external oracle price (above/below a threshold).
    *   Includes a condition based on the current block number.
    *   Includes a condition based on whether the vault *itself* holds a specific NFT (useful for mechanics where holding an item grants access).
    *   Includes a condition based on a *simulated* trait value of an NFT held by the vault.
    *   `checkAndReleaseConditional` allows anyone to trigger the release, potentially saving gas for the beneficiary once the condition is met.
6.  **Simulated Oracle:** The `simulatedOraclePrice` state variable and `updateSimulatedOraclePrice` function demonstrate how a contract *could* interact with an external data feed (like Chainlink Price Feeds), using the data for on-chain logic (`_checkCondition`).
7.  **Vault State Machine:** The `VaultState` enum (`Open`, `Restricted`, `QuantumFlux`) introduces different operational modes for the vault. The `withdraw` functions are shown to respect the `Restricted` state. This pattern allows dynamic contract behavior.
8.  **Simulated Randomness/State Fluctuation:** `triggerQuantumFluctuation` uses block data to pseudo-randomly change the `vaultState`. This demonstrates how on-chain "randomness" (even insecure blockhash-based randomness) or external random sources (like Chainlink VRF) could affect contract logic or state transitions.
9.  **Batch Operations:** `batchWithdrawERC20` shows how to perform multiple identical actions (token withdrawals) in a single transaction, saving gas for the caller.
10. **Simulated NFT Trait Logic:** `setNFTTraitValue` and `transferNFTBasedOnTrait` simulate the concept of an NFT having on-chain attributes that the vault can read and act upon (like conditional transfer based on a trait score).
11. **Non-Reentrancy Guard:** Used on critical withdrawal/release functions via `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin to protect against reentrancy attacks.
12. **Comprehensive Events:** Emits events for almost every state-changing action, crucial for off-chain monitoring and dApp interfaces.
13. **Emergency Withdrawals:** Allows the owner/manager to pull assets out quickly, even if the contract is paused.

This contract is an illustrative example. For a production environment, the simulated oracle and randomness would need to be replaced with robust, decentralized solutions (like Chainlink), and gas efficiency and potential attack vectors would require further rigorous testing and optimization. The state machine logic could also be expanded for more complex interactions.
