Okay, let's design a smart contract with an advanced concept. We'll call it the "QuantumVault" â€“ not because it uses quantum computing (Solidity can't do that!), but because it involves complex, conditional states, verifiable off-chain computation ("proofs"), and dependencies between locks, inspired by the complex interdependencies seen in quantum mechanics (like entanglement).

This contract will act as a secure vault that holds various assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) and releases them to designated recipients only when a combination of advanced, verifiable conditions are met.

**Core Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Conditional Locking:** Ability to lock ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens under a single release condition set.
2.  **Multiple Verifiable Condition Types:** Support for various complex conditions that must be met, potentially requiring off-chain computation or state verification.
3.  **Threshold Release:** Assets are released not necessarily when *all* conditions are met, but when a predefined *threshold* of conditions is satisfied.
4.  **Dependency Locks:** One lock's release can be set as a condition for another lock's release, creating chains or networks of dependencies ("Computational Entanglement").
5.  **Off-Chain Proof Integration (Simulated):** Conditions can require submitting verifiable "proofs" (represented by a hash in this simplified example) derived from off-chain computation or data.
6.  **State-Based Conditions (Simulated Oracle):** Conditions can depend on the state of another contract or an external data point provided by a trusted oracle.

// --- FUNCTION SUMMARY ---
// Constructor(address initialOracle): Initializes the contract owner and sets the oracle address.
// receive() external payable: Allows receiving ETH deposits not tied to a lock (e.g., gas, fees - though not used for fees in this design).
// onERC1155Received, onERC1155BatchReceived: ERC1155 standard receiver hooks.
// createConditionalLock(bytes calldata lockName, Asset[] calldata initialAssets, Condition[] calldata conditions, uint256 requiredThreshold, address[] calldata recipients) payable: Creates a new conditional lock. Requires ETH for direct ETH deposits. Token/NFT transfers must be approved *before* calling.
// addAssetsToLock(uint256 lockId, Asset[] calldata assetsToAdd) payable: Adds more assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) to an existing, unreleased lock.
// cancelLockByDepositor(uint256 lockId): Allows the original depositor to cancel the lock and retrieve assets if *no* conditions have been met yet.
// markTimeConditionMet(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex): Marks a Time condition as met if the current time is past the required timestamp. Callable by anyone.
// submitProofConditionResult(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex, bytes32 submittedProofHash): Marks a Proof condition as met if the submitted hash matches the required proof hash stored in the condition.
// confirmThresholdCondition(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex): Confirms a Threshold condition on behalf of the caller. Requires caller to be one of the designated confirmers.
// markStateConditionMetByOracle(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex): Marks a State condition as met. Only callable by the designated oracle address.
// attemptRelease(uint256 lockId): Attempts to release the assets held in the lock to the recipients if the required threshold of conditions is met.
// isLockReleasable(uint256 lockId) view returns (bool): Checks if the lock's condition threshold has been met.
// getLockDetails(uint256 lockId) view returns (ConditionalLock memory): Returns the full details of a conditional lock.
// getLockStatus(uint256 lockId) view returns (bool isExists, bool isReleased, uint256 conditionsMetCount, uint256 totalConditions, uint256 requiredThreshold): Returns a summary status of a lock.
// getConditionStatus(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex) view returns (bool isMet): Returns the met status of a specific condition within a lock.
// listActiveLockIds() view returns (uint256[] memory): Returns an array of IDs for all locks that have not yet been released.
// listDepositorLockIds(address depositor) view returns (uint256[] memory): Returns an array of IDs for locks created by a specific address.
// listRecipientLockIds(address recipient) view returns (uint256[] memory): Returns an array of IDs for locks where a specific address is listed as a recipient.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Aspects:**

1.  **Unified Multi-Asset Handling:** The `Asset` struct and corresponding deposit/transfer logic allow locking various token standards (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) within a single `ConditionalLock` instance, which is less common than single-asset timelocks or vesting contracts.
2.  **Abstracted Conditions:** The `Condition` struct and `ConditionType` enum provide a flexible framework. New condition types could be added in the future without changing the core lock structure, provided the necessary parameters are included in the struct and a corresponding `mark...ConditionMet` function is added.
3.  **Threshold Logic:** Releasing based on `requiredThreshold` rather than requiring *all* conditions to be met offers more flexibility, allowing for scenarios where some conditions might become impossible or irrelevant, but the intent of the lock can still be fulfilled if a majority are met.
4.  **Dependency Conditions ("Computational Entanglement"):** The `Dependency` condition (`dependencyLockId`) is a key creative feature. It creates a chain or network of dependencies between different locks. Releasing Lock A can automatically mark a condition as met in Lock B, potentially triggering B's release, which could then trigger C, and so on. This allows for complex state choreography across multiple conditional releases.
5.  **Simulated Off-Chain Verification:** The `Proof` and `State` conditions introduce the concept of verifiable off-chain data or computation influencing on-chain state. While the verification is simplified (`Proof` = hash match, `State` = oracle call), it models interactions with oracles, ZK systems, or other off-chain computation providers. The `requiredProofHash` and `stateVariableHash` serve as commitments to the off-chain data/computation being relied upon.
6.  **Threshold Conditions:** The `Threshold` condition adds a layer similar to multisig requirements *per condition*, not just for the overall release. This allows needing, for example, 3 out of 5 specific addresses to confirm a particular event occurred, independent of other conditions in the lock.
7.  **Modular Condition Marking:** Conditions are marked as met via separate, specific functions (`markTimeConditionMet`, `submitProofConditionResult`, etc.). This allows anyone to trigger the state change for permissionless conditions (like `Time`), while restricting others (like `State` via `onlyOracle`) or requiring specific data/permissions (like `Proof` or `Threshold`). The `attemptRelease` function is separate and can be called by anyone *after* the required conditions *have already been marked* as met.
8.  **Comprehensive State Tracking:** Mappings like `_depositorLocks` and `_recipientLocks`, along with the `_activeLockIds` array, provide efficient ways to query locks based on involved parties and their status, which is crucial for a complex vault contract.
9.  **Over 20 Functions:** The design naturally leads to a large number of functions to handle depositing, creating, adding to, canceling, marking various condition types, attempting release, and providing detailed view functions for querying the complex state.

**Notes & Limitations:**

*   **Simplified Verification:** The `Proof` and `State` conditions are simplified examples. A production system requiring trustless off-chain data/computation would need integration with robust oracle networks or on-chain ZK proof verification contracts.
*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating through arrays (like `_activeLockIds` in `_markDependencyConditionMet` or recipients/assets in `attemptRelease`) can become expensive with many locks, dependencies, assets, or recipients. More optimized data structures or off-chain indexing might be needed for very large-scale use.
*   **ERC721/ERC1155 Distribution:** The current implementation enforces a single recipient for ERC721 or ERC1155 amounts greater than 1 during release. A more flexible design might allow specifying recipient shares for specific tokens/NFTs within the lock creation.
*   **Threshold Confirmer List:** The `Threshold` condition as implemented doesn't explicitly store *who* the intended confirmers are, only how many confirmations are needed and which addresses *have* confirmed. A production version might add an array of allowed confirmer addresses to the `Condition` struct.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic `require` statements are used. More detailed error codes could be implemented.
*   **Audit:** This is a complex contract. It has *not* been audited and should not be used in production without thorough security review and testing.

This contract provides a framework for complex, conditional asset releases on the blockchain, moving beyond simple time-locks to incorporate verifiable external events and inter-lock dependencies, giving it an "advanced", "creative", and "trendy" feel inspired by complex systems.
