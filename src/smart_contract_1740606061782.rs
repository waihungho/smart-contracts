/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation Oracle with zk-SNARK Verification
 * @author Bard (AI Model)
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized reputation system where users earn reputation tokens based on provable actions.
 *         The key innovation is the integration of zk-SNARKs to verify claims without revealing the underlying details.
 *         This allows for verifiable, privacy-preserving reputation accrual based on actions performed off-chain.
 *         The contract acts as an oracle, accepting zk-SNARK proofs and issuing reputation tokens accordingly.
 *
 * ## Outline:
 * 1.  **Reputation Token Definition:**  Defines an ERC20-compatible token for representing reputation.
 * 2.  **Verifier Contract Interface:**  Assumes a separate Verifier contract (generated by a zk-SNARK proving system) exists.
 * 3.  **Reputation Request Structure:**  Defines the data required for a user to request reputation, including the zk-SNARK proof.
 * 4.  **Request Submission and Verification:**  Allows users to submit reputation requests and verifies the zk-SNARK proof via the Verifier contract.
 * 5.  **Reputation Issuance:**  If the proof is valid, the user is awarded the specified amount of reputation tokens.
 * 6.  **Governance (Simple):**  Basic owner-controlled parameters for token minting and verifier address management.
 *
 * ## Function Summary:
 * - `constructor(address _verifierContractAddress, string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol)`: Deploys the contract and initializes parameters.
 * - `setVerifier(address _newVerifier)`: Allows the owner to update the address of the zk-SNARK Verifier contract.
 * - `requestReputation(bytes32 _proof, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to request reputation tokens, submitting a zk-SNARK proof.
 * - `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows the owner to mint new reputation tokens (for initial distribution or special events).
 * - `balanceOf(address account)`:  Returns the reputation token balance of an address.
 * - `totalSupply()`:  Returns the total supply of reputation tokens.
 * - `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers tokens between addresses.
 * - `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Returns the allowance of spender to spend tokens on behalf of owner.
 * - `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approves spender to spend tokens on behalf of owner.
 * - `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers tokens from sender to recipient using the allowance mechanism.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **zk-SNARK Integration:** The core concept is the integration of zk-SNARKs. The `requestReputation` function now requires a `bytes32 _proof` as input.  The contract assumes a separate `IVerifier` contract exists (generated by a zk-SNARK proving system like Circom or ZoKrates). The provided proof is passed to the `verifyProof` function of the Verifier contract.  Crucially, this allows users to prove that they performed an action (e.g., contributed to an open-source project, participated in a survey) *without revealing the details of that action*.  The Verifier contract handles the complex cryptographic verification.
* **Verifier Contract Interface:** Defines an interface `IVerifier` to interact with the external zk-SNARK verifier contract. This promotes modularity and allows for easy swapping of verifier implementations.
* **Simplified ERC20 Implementation:**  Includes basic ERC20 functionality for the reputation token. It includes `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `allowance`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`.  This allows users to transfer their reputation tokens.
* **Governance:**  A simple `owner` role is added, allowing the owner to update the `verifierContractAddress` and mint new reputation tokens.  This allows for controlled updates and initial token distribution.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The contract focuses on the core logic of verifying proofs and issuing reputation. The complex cryptographic verification is handled by the external Verifier contract.
* **Event Emission:**  Emits `Transfer` and `Approval` events for standard ERC20 compliance, allowing off-chain monitoring of token transfers.
* **Safety Checks:** Includes `require` statements to prevent common errors (e.g., minting to the zero address, exceeding balance during transfer).

To use this contract:

1. **zk-SNARK Circuit and Proving System:** You'll need to define a zk-SNARK circuit that represents the action a user needs to perform to earn reputation.  Use a tool like Circom or ZoKrates to create the circuit, generate proving and verification keys, and generate a Verifier smart contract.
2. **Deploy the Verifier Contract:** Deploy the Verifier contract (generated by your zk-SNARK tooling) to the blockchain.
3. **Deploy the ReputationOracle Contract:** Deploy the `ReputationOracle` contract, providing the address of your deployed Verifier contract and the token name/symbol.
4. **User Action and Proof Generation:** Users perform the action defined by the zk-SNARK circuit. They then use the proving key and their input data to generate a zk-SNARK proof.
5. **Reputation Request:** Users call the `requestReputation` function, passing in the generated proof and the desired amount of reputation tokens.
6. **Verification and Issuance:** The `ReputationOracle` contract calls the Verifier contract to verify the proof. If the proof is valid, the user is awarded the reputation tokens.

This system provides a powerful way to incentivize desired behaviors with provable, privacy-preserving reputation.  The user can *prove* they've done something without revealing *what* they've done.  Adapt the zk-SNARK circuit and the `ReputationRequest` struct to match your specific use case.  Consider more robust ERC20 implementations (e.g., from OpenZeppelin) for a production environment.
