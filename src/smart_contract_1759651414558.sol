Here is a Solidity smart contract named `AegisNet`, designed as a Dynamic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DDAO) with advanced features. It incorporates a sophisticated goal management system, a dynamic reputation mechanism (`EffortPoints`), role-based access control, adaptive resource allocation, and a simulated interaction with external "oracle" modules for environmental data.

This contract aims to be creative and advanced by:
*   **Structured, Adaptive Goals:** Goals are not just text but structured data types with success metrics, deadlines, and inter-goal dependencies. Their state transitions are governed by votes and reports.
*   **Dynamic Reputation (`EffortPoints`):** A non-transferable point system that decays over time, encouraging continuous participation. It directly influences voting power, role assignments, and proposal eligibility.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Reputation Tiers:** Members earn roles (e.g., Initiator, Executor, Auditor) based on their reputation, granting them specific permissions.
*   **Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Treasury funds can be allocated to specific goals, and the allocation strategy itself can be updated based on internal/external factors.
*   **Simulated Oracle/Module Integration:** The contract provides hooks for external "modules" (simulated oracles) to submit environmental or market data, which can then influence the DAO's adaptive rules.
*   **Adaptive Rule Changes:** Mechanisms to propose and implement changes to core DAO parameters (like reputation decay rates or voting thresholds) in response to internal performance or external data.

/// @title AegisNet - A Dynamic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DDAO)
/// @author [Your Name/Alias]
/// @notice AegisNet is an advanced DDAO featuring adaptive goal setting, a dynamic reputation system,
///         role-based access control, and the ability to integrate with external modules for
///         specialized functions. It's designed to evolve and adapt to internal performance and
///         external environmental factors.
///
/// Outline and Function Summary:
///
/// I. Core Infrastructure & Access Control
///    1. constructor(): Initializes the DAO, setting initial parameters and the founding administrator.
///    2. updateAegisCoreSettings(uint256 _minReputationForProposal, uint256 _minReputationForVoting, uint256 _goalVoteThresholdPercentage, uint256 _reputationDecayRatePerSec, uint256 _reputationDecayPeriod):
///       Allows core DAO parameters like minimum reputation for proposals, voting thresholds, and
///       reputation decay rates to be adjusted by administrators (or high-reputation members via governance proposals).
///    3. registerExternalModule(address _moduleAddress, string memory _moduleName): Registers and whitelists an address
///       for an external "Module" contract, enabling inter-contract communication and specialized functionality.
///    4. setModuleOperationalStatus(address _moduleAddress, bool _isOperational): Activates or deactivates registered
///       external modules, allowing for dynamic system adjustments or emergency shutdowns of specific functionalities.
///
/// II. Dynamic Goal Management
///    5. proposeAdaptiveGoal(string memory _description, string[] memory _successMetrics, uint256 _deadline, uint256[] memory _dependencyGoalIds, address _resourcePoolId, uint256 _initialBudgetAmount, address _budgetToken, address[] memory _allocatedExecutors):
///       Allows users (meeting reputation thresholds) to propose structured goals, including detailed success metrics,
///       deadlines, dependencies on other goals, a target resource pool, initial budget, and designated executors.
///       This goes beyond simple text proposals by enforcing a structured approach to goal definition.
///    6. voteOnGoalProposal(uint256 _goalId, bool _support): Members with sufficient reputation can vote on proposed goals.
///       Voting power can be dynamically influenced by their current EffortPoints.
///    7. updateGoalPhase(uint256 _goalId, GoalStatus _newStatus): Advances the state of a goal (e.g., from 'Proposed' to 'Active',
///       'Completed', or 'Failed') based on votes, deadlines, or reported metrics. This function includes complex state transition logic.
///    8. reportGoalProgress(uint256 _goalId, uint256 _executorIndex, string memory _metricReport): Designated "Executor" roles
///       can submit verifiable progress reports against a goal's defined metrics. This can trigger phase transitions.
///    9. finalizeGoalCompletion(uint256 _goalId): Verifies the successful completion of a goal, triggers rewards, and updates
///       reputation for contributors. This typically requires consensus or an "Auditor" role's approval.
///    10. challengeGoalOutcome(uint256 _goalId, string memory _reason): Allows members to challenge a goal's reported progress
///        or finalization, triggering a re-evaluation or dispute resolution process, demonstrating advanced governance.
///
/// III. Reputation & Role System (EffortPoints - EP)
///    11. getEffortPoints(address _member): Retrieves the non-transferable `EffortPoints` balance for a given address,
///        reflecting their contribution and standing within the DAO.
///    12. triggerReputationDecay(): A public callable function (potentially by a keeper/bot) that initiates the periodic
///        decay of `EffortPoints` for the caller, encouraging continuous engagement. (Note: In a scalable system, decay
///        would often be lazily calculated or batched for efficiency).
///    13. requestRoleAssignment(Role _role): Allows members meeting specific EP thresholds to request assignment to a
///        specialized role (e.g., 'Auditor', 'Initiator') with associated permissions.
///    14. revokeRoleDueToReputation(address _member, Role _role): Automatically or manually revokes a role if a member's
///        reputation drops below the required threshold or if abuse is detected.
///
/// IV. Adaptive Resource & Treasury Management
///    15. depositTreasuryFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount): Allows external parties or the DAO itself to deposit
///        various ERC20 tokens into the treasury.
///    16. allocateGoalBudget(uint256 _goalId, address _token, uint256 _amount): Assigns a specific budget from the DAO
///        treasury to an active goal, accessible by its designated executors.
///    17. claimGoalResources(uint256 _goalId, address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient): Executors can claim funds
///        or resources from their allocated goal budget upon verified progress or milestones.
///    18. reclaimUnusedBudget(uint256 _goalId, address _token): Recovers any unspent funds from a completed or failed goal
///        back into the general treasury, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
///    19. updateResourceAllocationStrategy(bytes memory _newStrategyConfig): Allows administrators or high-reputation members
///        to propose and vote on new rules for how resources are allocated based on dynamic factors (e.g., market conditions,
///        goal priority, member reputation). The `_newStrategyConfig` is an illustrative complex payload.
///
/// V. Advanced Governance & Adaptive Logic
///    20. submitEnvironmentalMetric(string memory _metricName, uint256 _value, string memory _description): An oracle-only
///        function to submit external data (e.g., market sentiment, carbon footprint data, real-world event flags)
///        that can influence DAO decisions or goal prioritization, demonstrating external data integration.
///    21. proposeAdaptiveRuleChange(bytes memory _ruleChangePayload): A high-level proposal to modify core operational rules
///        (e.g., reputation decay rate, voting power calculations) based on internal performance metrics or external data.
///        The `_ruleChangePayload` is an illustrative complex payload.
///    22. activateEmergencyProtocol(string memory _reason): Triggers a predefined emergency state (e.g., pause fund transfers,
///        freeze new proposals) if critical conditions are met, requiring a super-majority or specific role activation.
///    23. deactivateEmergencyProtocol(): Deactivates the emergency protocol, resuming normal operations.
