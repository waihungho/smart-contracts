Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract called `QuantumVault`.

This contract incorporates several interesting and advanced concepts, including:

1.  **Commitment-Based Operations:** Inspired by Zero-Knowledge Proof concepts, users commit to deposit/withdrawal parameters (value, recipient, etc.) via a hash *before* revealing them. This offers a degree of privacy until the reveal/execution phase.
2.  **Conditional Logic & Simulated Oracle Interaction:** Funds can be locked until specific, externally verifiable conditions are met. A simplified oracle pattern is used for verification.
3.  **Time-Based Releases:** Deposits can be scheduled for automatic release at a future time.
4.  **Delegated Access with Function Hashing:** Users can delegate the *right* to call specific, pre-approved functions on their behalf to another address, restricted by time and the function itself (identified by its keccak256 hash).
5.  **Guardian Functionality:** A designated guardian can perform limited emergency actions (like initiating a time-locked withdrawal request for the user).
6.  **Simple On-Chain Reputation/Interaction Tracking:** Basic tracking of user interactions and potential penalty points.
7.  **Pausable & Ownable:** Standard administrative controls.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is designed for educational and conceptual purposes. The "proof" mechanism used for commitments is a simplified hash check and *not* a full ZK proof. Real-world applications would require more robust cryptographic proofs and potentially off-chain components. Do not use this code in production without extensive audits and security reviews.
