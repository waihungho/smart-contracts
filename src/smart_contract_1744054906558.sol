/**
 * @title DAOArt - Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Collaborative Art
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a DAO focused on collaborative art creation, curation, and fractional ownership.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 * 1. joinDAO(): Allows users to become DAO members by paying a membership fee.
 * 2. leaveDAO(): Allows members to exit the DAO and potentially receive a refund of membership fee (governed by DAO).
 * 3. proposeNewRule(string _ruleDescription): Allows members to propose new rules or changes to the DAO's governance.
 * 4. voteOnRuleProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members can vote on active rule proposals.
 * 5. executeRuleProposal(uint _proposalId): Executes a rule proposal if it passes the voting threshold.
 * 6. getVotingPower(address _member): Returns the voting power of a member (can be based on staked tokens or reputation).
 * 7. delegateVote(address _delegatee): Allows members to delegate their voting power to another member.
 *
 * **Art Creation & Submission:**
 * 8. submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _metadataURI): Members can propose new art pieces to be created collaboratively.
 * 9. voteOnArtProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members can vote on art proposals.
 * 10. createCollaborativeArt(uint _proposalId): Mints an NFT representing the collaborative artwork after proposal approval.
 * 11. contributeToArt(uint _artId, string _contributionDetails): Members can contribute to approved collaborative art pieces.
 * 12. finalizeArtContribution(uint _artId): Marks an art piece as finalized after contributions are complete (governed by DAO).
 *
 * **Art Curation & Display:**
 * 13. proposeArtForCuratedCollection(uint _artId): Members can propose existing DAO art for a curated collection.
 * 14. voteOnCuratedCollectionProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on art for curated collections.
 * 15. addArtToCuratedCollection(uint _proposalId): Adds approved art to the curated collection.
 * 16. viewCuratedCollection(): Returns a list of art IDs in the curated collection.
 *
 * **Fractional Ownership & Rewards:**
 * 17. fractionalizeArtNFT(uint _artId, uint _numberOfFractions): Allows DAO to fractionalize ownership of a collaborative NFT.
 * 18. buyFractionalArtShares(uint _artId, uint _sharesToBuy): Allows members to buy fractional shares of an art piece.
 * 19. redeemFractionalArtShares(uint _artId, uint _sharesToRedeem): Allows fractional owners to redeem their shares (potentially for rewards or governance power within the art piece itself - advanced concept).
 * 20. distributeArtRoyalties(uint _artId): Distributes royalties earned from the art piece to fractional owners.
 *
 * **Utility & Admin:**
 * 21. setMembershipFee(uint _fee): Admin function to set the membership fee.
 * 22. getMembershipFee(): Returns the current membership fee.
 * 23. pauseContract(): Admin function to pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 * 24. unpauseContract(): Admin function to resume contract functions after pausing.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

**Contract Title:** DAOArt - Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Collaborative Art

**Author:** Bard (Example Smart Contract - Not for Production)

**Purpose:** A smart contract for a DAO focused on collaborative art creation, curation, and fractional ownership.

**Function Categories:**

1.  **Membership & Governance (7 Functions):**
    *   `joinDAO()`: Become a DAO member by paying a fee.
    *   `leaveDAO()`: Exit the DAO.
    *   `proposeNewRule(string _ruleDescription)`: Propose changes to DAO rules.
    *   `voteOnRuleProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Vote on rule proposals.
    *   `executeRuleProposal(uint _proposalId)`: Execute approved rule proposals.
    *   `getVotingPower(address _member)`: Get member's voting power.
    *   `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Delegate voting power (concept, not fully implemented).

2.  **Art Creation & Submission (5 Functions):**
    *   `submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _metadataURI)`: Propose new collaborative art.
    *   `voteOnArtProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Vote on art proposals.
    *   `createCollaborativeArt(uint _proposalId)`: Mint NFT for approved art.
    *   `contributeToArt(uint _artId, string _contributionDetails)`: Contribute to art pieces.
    *   `finalizeArtContribution(uint _artId)`: Mark art as finalized (admin function).

3.  **Art Curation & Display (4 Functions):**
    *   `proposeArtForCuratedCollection(uint _artId)`: Propose art for curation.
    *   `voteOnCuratedCollectionProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Vote on curation proposals.
    *   `addArtToCuratedCollection(uint _proposalId)`: Add approved art to collection.
    *   `viewCuratedCollection()`: View art IDs in the curated collection.

4.  **Fractional Ownership & Rewards (4 Functions):**
    *   `fractionalizeArtNFT(uint _artId, uint _numberOfFractions)`: Fractionalize art NFT (admin function).
    *   `buyFractionalArtShares(uint _artId, uint _sharesToBuy)`: Buy fractional shares.
    *   `redeemFractionalArtShares(uint _artId, uint _sharesToRedeem)`: Redeem fractional shares (concept, not fully implemented).
    *   `distributeArtRoyalties(uint _artId)`: Distribute royalties to fractional owners (admin function).

5.  **Utility & Admin (4 Functions):**
    *   `setMembershipFee(uint _fee)`: Set membership fee (admin function).
    *   `getMembershipFee()`: Get membership fee.
    *   `pauseContract()`: Pause contract (admin function).
    *   `unpauseContract()`: Unpause contract (admin function).

**Helper Functions (Internal/Private):**

*   `hasVoted(address _member, uint _proposalId)`: Check if member voted.
*   `recordVote(address _member, uint _proposalId)`: Record member's vote.
*   `uint2str(uint _i)`: Utility function to convert uint to string for events.

**Advanced Concepts & Trendy Features:**

*   **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):**  The core structure is a DAO, enabling community governance and ownership.
*   **Collaborative Art Creation:**  Focuses on creating art pieces through community contributions and voting.
*   **NFTs for Art Ownership:**  Uses NFTs to represent ownership of collaborative art pieces.
*   **Fractional Ownership:**  Implements fractionalization of art NFTs, allowing shared ownership and potentially democratizing access to valuable digital art.
*   **Curated Collections:**  Introduces the concept of community-curated art collections within the DAO.
*   **Voting and Governance:**  Includes rule proposals, art proposals, and curation proposals, all governed by member voting.
*   **Potential for Royalties and Rewards:**  Outlines a royalty distribution mechanism for fractional owners (though royalty income generation is not fully implemented in this example).
*   **Vote Delegation (Concept):**  Includes a function for vote delegation, a more advanced governance feature.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Example Contract:** This is an example contract and is **not intended for production use without thorough security audits and further development.**
*   **Simplified Implementation:** Some advanced features (like vote delegation, fractional share redemption, royalty income generation, and complex rule execution) are conceptual or simplified for demonstration purposes. A real-world implementation would require more robust and detailed logic.
*   **Security Considerations:**  Security vulnerabilities are possible in any smart contract. Thorough auditing and testing are crucial before deploying to a production environment.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This contract is written for clarity and feature demonstration, not necessarily for gas optimization.  Production contracts would require careful gas optimization techniques.
*   **Off-Chain Components:**  Many aspects of a real-world DAO (like UI, off-chain voting interfaces, metadata storage, etc.) are not covered by this smart contract and would require additional development.
