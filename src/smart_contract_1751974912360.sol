Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract featuring an advanced concept: a "CryptoMinds" platform for crowdsourcing, validating, and rewarding innovative ideas using staking, dynamic NFTs, and a simple on-chain reputation system. It avoids standard open-source patterns by combining these elements into a unique flow.

It includes more than 20 functions, covers state management, token interaction, NFT logic, time-based mechanics, and a basic reward/slashing system.

    // --- Outline ---
    // 1. State Variables: Contract settings, counters, mappings for ideas, stakes, users.
    // 2. Enums: Idea states.
    // 3. Structs: Idea details, Stake details, NFT data.
    // 4. Events: Signalling key actions and state changes.
    // 5. Modifiers: Restricting function access based on state or time.
    // 6. Constructor: Initializing the contract.
    // 7. Core Logic Functions:
    //    - Idea Submission & Management (submitIdea, getIdeaDetails, getTotalIdeas, getIdeaState)
    //    - Staking (stakeOnIdea, unstakeOnRejectedIdea, getIdeaStakers, getUserIdeaStakeAmount, getTotalStakeOnIdea)
    //    - Validation (processIdea - Owner/Validator function)
    //    - Claiming Rewards (claimRewards)
    //    - Reputation Management (getUserReputation) - Linked to validation outcomes.
    //    - Funding (fundRewardPool, withdrawFees)
    // 8. NFT Logic Functions (ERC721Enumerable):
    //    - Minting (mintValidatedIdeaNFT) - Dynamic based on validated ideas.
    //    - Dynamic Traits (getNFTData, tokenURI) - Traits linked to idea success/stake.
    //    - Standard ERC721Enumerable functions (balanceOf, ownerOf, transferFrom, safeTransferFrom, approve, setApprovalForAll, getApproved, isApprovedForAll, tokenOfOwnerByIndex, tokenByIndex, totalSupply, supportsInterface).
    // 9. View/Helper Functions: Checking periods, retrieving structured data.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Idea Lifecycle Management:** Ideas transition through distinct states (`Submitted`, `Staked`, `Validated`, `Rejected`, `Processed`) controlled by time periods and a validation action. This creates a clear state machine for each idea.
2.  **Token Staking on Predictions:** Users stake tokens (`MINDToken`) on the *success* of an idea during a specific window. This is a form of prediction market or curated crowdsourcing mechanism.
3.  **Time-Based Mechanics:** Actions like staking (`whenStakingPeriodActive`) and validation (`whenValidationPeriodActive`) are strictly controlled by defined time periods relative to the idea's submission time.
4.  **On-Chain Reputation System:** A basic `userReputation` score is tracked. It increases for authors of validated ideas and stakers on validated ideas, and decreases for authors of rejected ideas. While simple, this could be expanded significantly.
5.  **Reward & Slashing Logic:**
    *   Stakers on `Validated` ideas receive their principal back plus a percentage-based reward calculated from their staked amount.
    *   Stakers on `Rejected` ideas have a percentage of their principal `slashed`. The remaining principal can be claimed.
    *   Slashed funds can be collected by the owner (or could fund the reward pool, be burned, etc.).
6.  **Dynamic NFTs:**
    *   `IdeaNFT`s are minted only for `Validated` ideas.
    *   Only participants (author or stakers) of a validated idea can mint its corresponding NFT.
    *   The NFT is *linked* to the idea (`nftIdeaMap`, `ideaNFTMap`).
    *   Crucially, the `tokenURI` function is set up to point to a base URI. A hypothetical off-chain metadata service would receive the `tokenId`, call `getNFTData` on the contract to get the idea's outcome (`validated`, `totalIdeaStake`), and dynamically generate the NFT metadata (name, description, image, *traits*) based on this on-chain data. This makes the NFT's characteristics *dynamic* or *derived* from the idea's success on the platform, not static.
7.  **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Functions are grouped by their role (core logic, view functions, standard ERC721).
8.  **Access Control:** `Ownable` is used to restrict sensitive functions like `processIdea` (acting as a central validator for this example, but could be replaced by a DAO or oracle) and funding/withdrawal.
9.  **Gas Considerations:** While not fully optimized for massive scale (e.g., iterating through all stakers in `processIdea` or listing all user stakes is avoided), the design uses mappings and requires users to specify IDs for claiming (`claimRewards`) to mitigate some gas issues.
10. **Modular Structure:** Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for standard implementations (ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, SafeMath, Counters), allowing focus on the unique logic.

This contract provides a framework for a decentralized idea validation market, incorporating elements of prediction markets, reputation systems, and dynamic on-chain assets (NFTs) tied to the success of intellectual contributions.
