 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) with advanced features
 * including dynamic NFT fractionalization, curated exhibitions, community-driven governance,
 * AI-powered art analysis for authenticity, and a reputation system for participants.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **Core Art Management:**
 * 1. submitArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice): Allows artists to submit artwork for review.
 * 2. mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId): Mints an NFT for an approved artwork.
 * 3. setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice): Allows artists to update the price of their artwork.
 * 4. purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to purchase artwork NFTs directly.
 * 5. getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 6. listGalleryArtworks(): Returns a list of all artworks in the gallery.
 * 7. removeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows the gallery owner (DAO) to remove an artwork (governance required in real implementation).
 *
 * **Fractionalization & Ownership:**
 * 8. fractionalizeArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions): Fractionalizes an artwork NFT into fungible tokens.
 * 9. purchaseFractionalShares(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _amount): Allows users to purchase fractional shares of an artwork.
 * 10. redeemFractionalShareNFT(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _amount): Allows holders of fractional shares to redeem them for a proportional share of the original NFT (governance/voting mechanism needed for practical implementation).
 * 11. getArtworkFractionalSupply(uint256 _artworkId): Returns the total supply of fractional tokens for an artwork.
 * 12. getFractionalBalance(uint256 _artworkId, address _account): Returns the fractional token balance of an account for a specific artwork.
 *
 * **Curated Exhibitions & Events:**
 * 13. proposeExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, uint256[] memory _artworkIds): Allows curators/community to propose exhibitions.
 * 14. voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Allows members to vote on exhibition proposals (governance required).
 * 15. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 * 16. listActiveExhibitions(): Returns a list of active exhibitions.
 *
 * **Advanced & Trendy Features:**
 * 17. analyzeArtworkAuthenticity(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _aiAnalysisReportHash): Simulates AI-powered authenticity analysis (in real-world, this would be an oracle integration).
 * 18. reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reportReason): Allows users to report potentially problematic artworks (moderation queue).
 * 19. contributeToGalleryFund(): Allows users to contribute to the gallery's operational fund.
 * 20. withdrawArtistEarnings(): Allows artists to withdraw their earned funds from artwork sales.
 * 21. setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage): Allows the gallery owner (DAO) to set the platform fee percentage (governance required).
 * 22. getPlatformFee(): Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 * 23. setCurator(address _curatorAddress, bool _isCurator): Allows the gallery owner (DAO) to manage curators (governance required).
 * 24. isCurator(address _account): Checks if an address is a curator.
 *
 * **Events:**
 * - ArtworkSubmitted(uint256 artworkId, address artist, string title);
 * - ArtworkNFTMinted(uint256 artworkId, address artist, uint256 tokenId);
 * - ArtworkPriceUpdated(uint256 artworkId, uint256 newPrice);
 * - ArtworkPurchased(uint256 artworkId, address buyer, uint256 price);
 * - ArtworkFractionalized(uint256 artworkId, uint256 numberOfFractions);
 * - FractionalSharesPurchased(uint256 artworkId, address buyer, uint256 amount);
 * - FractionalSharesRedeemed(uint256 artworkId, address redeemer, uint256 amount);
 * - ExhibitionProposed(uint256 proposalId, string name, address proposer);
 * - ExhibitionVoteCast(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool vote);
 * - ExhibitionStarted(uint256 exhibitionId);
 * - ExhibitionEnded(uint256 exhibitionId);
 * - ArtworkAuthenticityAnalyzed(uint256 artworkId, string aiReportHash);
 * - ArtworkReported(uint256 artworkId, address reporter, string reason);
 * - GalleryFundContribution(address contributor, uint256 amount);
 * - ArtistEarningsWithdrawn(address artist, uint256 amount);
 * - PlatformFeeUpdated(uint256 newFeePercentage);
 * - CuratorStatusUpdated(address curator, bool isCurator);
