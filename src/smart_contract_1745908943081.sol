Okay, here is a smart contract concept combining several interesting and advanced ideas around Regenerative Finance (ReFi), verifiable impact, role-based access, dynamic rewards, and staking, while aiming for a unique structure.

It's called `EcoRewardHub`. Its core idea is to facilitate funding for ecological projects, verify their impact through trusted roles (representing oracles or decentralized verification committees), and distribute rewards based on a combination of project funding, user staking, and verified individual ecological contributions reported through the system.

---

**Outline & Function Summary**

*   **Contract Name:** `EcoRewardHub`
*   **Purpose:** To create a decentralized platform for funding ecological projects, tracking verifiable positive impact, and distributing rewards based on funding, staking, and user contributions. It integrates concepts of ReFi, impact verification (via roles), complex reward mechanics, and stake-based participation.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Projects:** Structured data representing ecological initiatives with funding goals, status, and impact metrics.
    *   **Funding:** Users can fund approved projects. Funds are held by the contract.
    *   **Impact Verification:** Specific roles (`IMPACT_ORACLE_ROLE`) are authorized to submit verified impact data for projects.
    *   **User Contribution:** Specific roles (`CONTRIBUTION_VERIFIER_ROLE`) can update user "contribution scores" based on off-chain ecological actions.
    *   **Staking:** Users stake a designated `IRewardToken` to participate, earn potential rewards, and gain eligibility.
    *   **Reward Distribution:** Rewards (from the `IRewardToken` pool within the contract) are distributed to funders, stakers, and high-contribution users based on project success and verifiable impact.
    *   **Roles:** Owner manages core settings and grants specific roles (`IMPACT_ORACLE_ROLE`, `CONTRIBUTION_VERIFIER_ROLE`).
    *   **Pausable:** Emergency stop mechanism.
    *   **Non-Reentrant:** Protection for critical state-changing functions involving token transfers.

*   **Functions (25+):**

    1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, sets the owner, and sets the reward token address.
    2.  `pause()`: (Owner) Pauses contract execution in emergencies.
    3.  `unpause()`: (Owner) Unpauses contract execution.
    4.  `grantRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: (Owner) Grants a specific role to an address.
    5.  `revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: (Owner) Revokes a specific role from an address.
    6.  `hasRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Checks if an address has a specific role.
    7.  `setRewardToken(IERC20 _rewardToken)`: (Owner) Sets or updates the address of the reward token.
    8.  `setMinStakeAmount(uint256 _amount)`: (Owner) Sets the minimum required stake amount for certain actions/rewards.
    9.  `proposeProject(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256 _fundingGoal, uint256 _impactGoal)`: Users propose a new ecological project.
    10. `approveProject(uint256 _projectId)`: (Owner) Approves a proposed project, making it eligible for funding.
    11. `rejectProject(uint256 _projectId)`: (Owner) Rejects a proposed project.
    12. `cancelProject(uint256 _projectId)`: (Proposer) Cancels a project if not yet active/approved.
    13. `fundProject(uint256 _projectId) payable`: Users fund an approved project with native currency (e.g., ETH).
    14. `withdrawProjectFunding(uint256 _projectId)`: (Project Proposer, if project is active/funded) Allows proposer to withdraw raised funds (subject to rules, e.g., unlock after reaching goal or based on milestones).
    15. `claimFundingRefund(uint256 _projectId)`: Users claim a refund if a project is rejected or fails its funding goal.
    16. `stakeRewardToken(uint256 _amount)`: Users stake the `IRewardToken`.
    17. `unstakeRewardToken(uint256 _amount)`: Users unstake `IRewardToken`. Requires rewards to be claimed first if logic dictates.
    18. `submitVerifiedImpact(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _actualImpactUnits)`: (IMPACT_ORACLE_ROLE) Submits verified impact units for a completed project. Triggers reward calculation readiness.
    19. `updateUserContributionScore(address _user, uint256 _scoreDelta)`: (CONTRIBUTION_VERIFIER_ROLE) Updates a user's overall contribution score. Can be positive or negative delta.
    20. `calculateProjectRewardAmount(uint256 _projectId, address _user)`: (View) Calculates the potential reward amount for a user for a specific project based on funding, staking, contribution score, and project impact.
    21. `claimProjectRewards(uint256 _projectId)`: Users claim calculated rewards for a project after impact verification and reward distribution readiness is triggered.
    22. `claimStakingRewards()`: Users claim rewards accumulated from staking (e.g., a share of platform fees or a separate pool).
    23. `getProjectDetails(uint256 _projectId)`: (View) Returns details of a specific project.
    24. `getUserFunding(uint256 _projectId, address _user)`: (View) Returns the amount a user funded for a specific project.

    27. `getClaimableProjectRewards(uint256 _projectId, address _user)`: (View) Returns the amount of rewards a user can claim for a specific project. (Wrapper for internal calculation).
    28. `getClaimableStakingRewards(address _user)`: (View) Returns the amount of staking rewards a user can claim.
    29. `getTotalStaked()`: (View) Returns the total amount of `IRewardToken` staked in the contract.
    30. `getProjectCount()`: (View) Returns the total number of projects proposed.

        // 3. Matching funds provided by the protocol
        // Let's assume the reward pool comes from a total amount of rewardToken available in the contract.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Core:** The entire contract is built around funding and rewarding *ecological impact*, directly aligning with ReFi principles.
2.  **Verifiable Impact (via Roles):** Instead of relying on trust, critical data like `actualImpactUnits` is submitted only by addresses holding the `IMPACT_ORACLE_ROLE`. This abstracts the concept of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) or oracle networks providing real-world verified data on chain.
3.  **Complex Dynamic Reward Formula:** The `_calculateRewardAmount` function demonstrates a non-trivial reward distribution based on multiple factors: project funding amount, user's overall "contribution score", and user's staked amount. This encourages different types of participation (financial backing, general ecosystem activity, protocol commitment via staking). The formula also incorporates an `Impact Multiplier`, directly linking rewards to the *effectiveness* of the project.
4.  **User Contribution Score:** The `userContributionScores` mapping and `updateUserContributionScore` function introduce an on-chain reputation or activity scoring system. This score, updated by trusted `CONTRIBUTION_VERIFIER_ROLE`s (representing verification of off-chain ecological actions like waste cleanup, tree planting, etc.), directly influences reward potential, moving beyond purely financial participation.
5.  **Staking with Utility:** Staking `IRewardToken` isn't just passive yield (though `claimStakingRewards` is a placeholder for that). Staking also acts as a factor in the project-specific reward calculation (`_calculateRewardAmount`), potentially increasing a user's share in successful projects and acting as an eligibility requirement (`minStakeAmount`).
6.  **Role-Based Access Control (Basic):** Using `bytes32` roles (`IMPACT_ORACLE_ROLE`, `CONTRIBUTION_VERIFIER_ROLE`) assigned by the owner provides a structured way to delegate specific powerful actions, which is more flexible than simple `onlyOwner` for all sensitive operations. This pattern is fundamental for building decentralized applications with differentiated permissions.
7.  **Project Lifecycle Management:** The `ProjectStatus` enum and associated functions (`proposeProject`, `approveProject`, `rejectProject`, `cancelProject`, `fundProject`, `submitVerifiedImpact`) define a clear on-chain state machine for projects, tracking their progress from proposal to completion and impact verification.
8.  **Non-Reentrant Guards:** Standard but essential for security when handling token transfers and native currency withdrawals.
9.  **Pausable Emergency Stop:** Allows the owner to pause critical functions in case of discovered vulnerabilities or issues.
10. **Internal Helper Functions (`_calculateRewardAmount`)**: Breaking down complex logic into internal functions improves readability and testability. The design choice to calculate rewards *at claim time* rather than pre-calculating for everyone is an optimization for gas efficiency, avoiding expensive loops during impact submission.

This contract goes beyond a basic ERC-20 or simple escrow by incorporating verifiable impact data, complex reward mechanics based on multiple factors, and a light-touch reputation system, all centered around an ecological/ReFi theme. It includes over 20 functions covering the full lifecycle of a project within the hub and user interactions.
