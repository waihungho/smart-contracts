Okay, let's create a smart contract based on the concept of a "Quantum Vault". This contract will manage deposits of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, incorporating ideas around:

1.  **ZK-inspired Privacy:** Users deposit by submitting a *commitment* (a hash of their deposit details + a secret) rather than directly associating their address with the deposit amount. Withdrawals require a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-Proof) that verifies the user owns a valid commitment *without revealing which one* or the original deposit details, and that they are trying to withdraw a valid amount.
2.  **Oracle-Driven Dynamic Conditions ("Quantum Conditions"):** Withdrawal eligibility or parameters (like fees/bonuses) can be influenced by external data provided by a trusted oracle network, simulating unpredictable "quantum state" changes.
3.  **Multi-Asset Handling:** Manages both ETH and various ERC-20 tokens.
4.  **Advanced State Management:** Tracks commitments, total balances, and the state of external "quantum conditions".

This contract won't *implement* a full ZK-SNARK prover/verifier logic itself (that's usually done in separate precompiled contracts or complex on-chain verifiers which are circuit-specific and would make this example too long and tied to a specific ZK setup), but it will provide the *interface* and *structure* to integrate with one. The oracle interaction will also be simplified using an interface.

**Contract Name:** QuantumVault

**Concept:** A non-custodial vault allowing deposits of ETH and ERC-20 tokens using cryptographic commitments for privacy, and subjecting withdrawals to dynamic, oracle-influenced "quantum conditions" verifiable via Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

**Outline:**

1.  **Pragma & Imports:** Specify Solidity version, import ERC20 interface and Context/Ownable (or implement manually).
2.  **Errors:** Custom errors for clarity.
3.  **Events:** Log significant actions (deposits, withdrawals, state changes).
4.  **Interfaces:** Define interfaces for the ZK Proof Verifier and the Oracle.
5.  **State Variables:** Store contract owner, pause status, allowed tokens, total balances, mapping for used commitment hashes (to prevent double-spending proofs), addresses of Verifier and Oracle contracts, mapping for "quantum condition" states, and base withdrawal fee.
6.  **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, `onlyVerifier`, `onlyOracle`.
7.  **Constructor:** Initialize owner, verifier, and oracle addresses.
8.  **Receive/Fallback:** Handle direct ETH deposits (associate with a commitment).
9.  **Core Deposit Functions:**
    *   `depositETH(bytes32 commitmentHash)`
    *   `depositERC20(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, bytes32 commitmentHash)`
10. **Core Withdrawal Functions:**
    *   `withdrawETH(uint256 amount, address payable recipient, bytes32 commitmentHash, uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[2] calldata publicInputs)`
    *   `withdrawERC20(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, address recipient, bytes32 commitmentHash, uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[2] calldata publicInputs)`
11. **Admin & Configuration Functions:**
    *   `addAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`
    *   `removeAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`
    *   `setVerifier(IVerifier _verifier)`
    *   `setOracle(IOracle _oracle)`
    *   `pause()`
    *   `unpause()`
    *   `setBaseWithdrawalFeePercentage(uint256 feeBasisPoints)`
    *   `registerQuantumConditionType(bytes32 conditionKey, string description)`
    *   `unregisterQuantumConditionType(bytes32 conditionKey)`
12. **Oracle Callback Function:**
    *   `updateQuantumConditionState(bytes32 conditionKey, bytes data, uint256 timestamp, uint256 oracleId, bytes signature)` - Called by the oracle (with signature verification).
13. **Query Functions:**
    *   `isAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`
    *   `getContractETHBalance()`
    *   `getContractTokenBalance(IERC20 token)`
    *   `isCommitmentHashUsed(bytes32 commitmentHash)`
    *   `getQuantumConditionState(bytes32 conditionKey)`
    *   `getBaseWithdrawalFeePercentage()`
    *   `getWithdrawalFee(uint256 amount)` - Calculates fee based on base fee and potentially current conditions.
    *   `getRegisteredQuantumConditionTypes()`
14. **Internal Helper Functions:**
    *   `_checkWithdrawalConditions(uint256 amount, IERC20 token)` - Logic based on `quantumConditionStates`.
    *   `_verifyZKProof(bytes32 commitmentHash, uint256 amount, uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[2] calldata publicInputs)` - Calls the external verifier contract.

**Function Summary (28 Functions):**

1.  `constructor(IVerifier _verifier, IOracle _oracle)`: Initializes the contract, sets owner, ZK verifier, and oracle addresses.
2.  `receive()`: Allows receiving plain ETH deposits. Requires a corresponding commitment deposit *after* this. (Simplified for this example; a true ZK mixer requires `depositETH(bytes32 commitmentHash)` for all ETH).
3.  `depositETH(bytes32 commitmentHash)`: Records an ETH deposit linked to a commitment hash. The actual ETH transfer *must* happen via `receive()` or a payable function call *before* or *concurrently* with this. This version assumes ETH is sent separately via `receive()`.
4.  `depositERC20(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, bytes32 commitmentHash)`: Records an ERC-20 deposit linked to a commitment hash. Requires `approve()` beforehand.
5.  `withdrawETH(uint256 amount, address payable recipient, bytes32 commitmentHash, uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[2] calldata publicInputs)`: Executes an ETH withdrawal if ZK proof is valid, commitment hash is unused, and quantum conditions are met. Marks commitment hash as used.
6.  `withdrawERC20(IERC20 token, uint256 amount, address recipient, bytes32 commitmentHash, uint256[8] calldata proof, uint256[2] calldata publicInputs)`: Executes an ERC-20 withdrawal under the same conditions as `withdrawETH`.
7.  `addAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`: (Owner) Adds an ERC-20 token to the list of accepted deposit tokens.
8.  `removeAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`: (Owner) Removes an ERC-20 token from the list.
9.  `setVerifier(IVerifier _verifier)`: (Owner) Sets the address of the trusted ZK proof verifier contract.
10. `setOracle(IOracle _oracle)`: (Owner) Sets the address of the trusted Oracle contract.
11. `pause()`: (Owner) Pauses deposit and withdrawal functions.
12. `unpause()`: (Owner) Unpauses the contract.
13. `renounceOwnership()`: (Owner) Relinquishes ownership of the contract.
14. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: (Owner) Transfers ownership to a new address.
15. `setBaseWithdrawalFeePercentage(uint256 feeBasisPoints)`: (Owner) Sets the base fee applied to withdrawals (in basis points, 100 = 1%).
16. `registerQuantumConditionType(bytes32 conditionKey, string description)`: (Owner) Registers a key under which the oracle can report state.
17. `unregisterQuantumConditionType(bytes32 conditionKey)`: (Owner) Unregisters a condition key.
18. `updateQuantumConditionState(bytes32 conditionKey, bytes data, uint256 timestamp, uint256 oracleId, bytes signature)`: (Oracle/Authorized Caller) Updates the state associated with a `conditionKey`. Requires signature verification from the trusted oracle.
19. `isAllowedToken(IERC20 token)`: (View) Checks if a token is in the allowed list.
20. `getContractETHBalance()`: (View) Returns the total ETH held by the contract.
21. `getContractTokenBalance(IERC20 token)`: (View) Returns the total amount of a specific token held by the contract.
22. `isCommitmentHashUsed(bytes32 commitmentHash)`: (View) Checks if a commitment hash has already been used for a withdrawal.
23. `getQuantumConditionState(bytes32 conditionKey)`: (View) Returns the raw data bytes associated with a quantum condition key.
24. `getBaseWithdrawalFeePercentage()`: (View) Returns the current base withdrawal fee percentage.
25. `getWithdrawalFee(uint256 amount)`: (Pure/View based on implementation) Calculates the total withdrawal fee for a given amount, considering base fee and potential condition modifiers (Placeholder logic in example).
26. `getRegisteredQuantumConditionTypes()`: (View) Returns a list of registered condition keys.
27. `emergencyOwnerWithdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: (Owner) Allows the owner to withdraw ETH in an emergency. **Note:** This bypasses the privacy mechanism and conditions for the withdrawn amount.
28. `emergencyOwnerWithdrawERC20(IERC20 token, uint256 amount)`: (Owner) Allows the owner to withdraw tokens in an emergency. **Note:** Bypasses privacy and conditions.

 * @title QuantumVault
 * @dev A multi-asset vault integrating ZK-inspired privacy and oracle-driven dynamic conditions.

 * - Oracle-Driven Conditions: External factors (market data, randomness, events) provided by a trusted oracle
 *   can affect withdrawal eligibility or parameters (fees, bonuses).
 * - Multi-Asset: Supports ETH and approved ERC-20 tokens.

 * Note: This contract provides the structure and interfaces for ZK and Oracle interaction.
