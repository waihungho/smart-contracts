Okay, let's design a complex, interesting smart contract. A good theme that allows for lots of interconnected functions is a Decentralized Autonomous Guild (DAG) focused on collaborative tasks (quests/bounties), member reputation, and resource management.

This DAG will have features like:
1.  **Membership:** Join/leave mechanics, staking for access/status.
2.  **Guild Token:** An internal utility/governance token.
3.  **Reputation System:** Earned via contributions, used for voting weight and access.
4.  **Quests/Bounties:** Mechanism for proposing, funding, completing, and rewarding work.
5.  **Treasury:** Manage pooled ERC20, ERC721, and native tokens.
6.  **Governance:** Token/Reputation weighted voting on proposals (funding, config, roles, external calls).
7.  **Roles:** Specific roles (e.g., Quest Reviewer, Elder) managed by governance.
8.  **Configuration:** Governance-controlled parameters.

This design naturally leads to many functions managing state transitions between these components.

---

### Decentralized Autonomous Guild (DAG) - Outline

*   **Contract Name:** DecentralizedAutonomousGuild
*   **Core Concept:** A community-governed entity managing a treasury, facilitating collaborative work (quests), and tracking member reputation/contribution.
*   **Key Components:** Members, Guild Token, Reputation, Quests, Treasury, Governance, Roles, Configuration.
*   **Dependencies:** Assumes interaction with external ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. Does not implement these standards internally but interacts with them.
*   **Access Control:** Primarily uses Governance proposals for critical actions. Some actions might be restricted by specific roles.
*   **Treasury Management:** Contract itself holds funds (ETH, ERC20, ERC721).

### Decentralized Autonomous Guild (DAG) - Function Summary

1.  `constructor(...)`: Initializes the contract, sets initial parameters and dependencies (like the Guild Token address).
2.  `joinGuild()`: Allows an address to join the guild by staking a required amount of the Guild Token.
3.  `leaveGuild()`: Allows a member to leave the guild by unstaking their tokens (might involve cooldown/penalties).
4.  `stakeGuildTokens(uint256 amount)`: Explicitly stake more Guild Tokens to increase governance power/status.
5.  `unstakeGuildTokens(uint256 amount)`: Explicitly unstake Guild Tokens (subject to cooldown/locks).
6.  `claimPassiveReputation()`: Allows members to claim passive reputation accrued based on their staked token balance over time.
7.  `createQuest(string memory description, QuestReward[] memory rewards, uint256 requiredReputation, uint64 reviewPeriod)`: Proposes a new quest/bounty for members to complete. Requires funding.
8.  `fundQuest(uint256 questId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone (or the treasury via governance) to deposit funds for a specific quest's ERC20 rewards.
9.  `fundQuestNFT(uint256 questId, address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows anyone (or the treasury via governance) to deposit an NFT for a specific quest's reward.
10. `proposeQuestCompletion(uint256 questId, string memory evidenceUrl)`: A member submits evidence of completing a quest, initiating the review process.
11. `assignQuestReviewer(uint256 questId, address reviewer)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or `ELDER_ROLE`) Assigns a specific member to review a quest completion proposal.
12. `submitReview(uint256 questId, bool approved, string memory reviewNotes)`: (Role: Assigned Reviewer) The assigned reviewer submits their judgment on a quest completion.
13. `claimQuestReward(uint256 questId)`: Member whose completion was approved claims the quest rewards (tokens/NFTs).
14. `createGovernanceProposal(string memory description, address targetContract, bytes memory callData, uint64 votePeriod)`: Creates a new proposal to execute an arbitrary function call on a target contract (often self, or whitelisted contracts).
15. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Members vote on an active proposal, weight based on staked tokens and reputation.
16. `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Allows a member to delegate their voting power to another member (Liquid Democracy).
17. `undelegateVote()`: Revokes vote delegation.
18. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it has passed and the voting period is over.
19. `depositTreasury(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows depositing ERC20 tokens into the treasury (ETH via `receive`/`fallback`).
20. `withdrawTreasury(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, address recipient)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Withdraw funds from the treasury.
21. `mintGuildToken(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Mints new Guild Tokens, potentially for rewards or initial distribution. Controlled inflation.
22. `burnGuildToken(uint256 amount)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Burns Guild Tokens from the caller's balance (controlled deflation).
23. `assignRole(address member, bytes32 role)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Assigns a specific role to a member.
24. `revokeRole(address member, bytes32 role)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Revokes a specific role from a member.
25. `updateConfiguration(bytes32 key, uint256 value)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or via Governance Proposal) Updates a generic configuration parameter (e.g., `STAKE_REQUIRED`, `VOTING_THRESHOLD`).
26. `slashReputation(address member, uint256 amount)`: (Role: `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` or `ELDER_ROLE`) Reduces a member's reputation due to misconduct (e.g., failed review, malicious proposal).
27. `getMemberStatus(address member)`: Returns details about a member's status, stake, reputation, and roles.
28. `getQuestDetails(uint256 questId)`: Returns details about a specific quest, its status, rewards, and completion proposals.
29. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns details about a specific governance proposal, its state, votes, and execution data.
30. `getTreasuryBalance(address tokenAddress)`: Returns the balance of a specific token held by the contract.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Guild (DAG):** A specific structure combining DAO principles with a gaming/community-oriented 'Guild' theme. Less abstract than a generic DAO, more focused on collaborative work and reputation.
2.  **Hybrid Governance Weighting:** Voting power is derived from *both* staked tokens (Proof-of-Stake influence) and accrued reputation (Proof-of-Contribution influence). This moves beyond simple token-weighted voting.
3.  **Reputation System:** An on-chain, accruing, and slashable reputation score tied to member actions (staking time, quest completion). This adds a non-financial metric for influence and status.
4.  **Quest/Bounty Board:** A structured process for submitting, reviewing, funding, and rewarding specific tasks needed by the guild. Includes multiple states (Open, UnderReview, Approved, Rejected).
5.  **Multi-Asset Treasury:** The contract can hold and distribute native ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 NFTs, managed via governance.
6.  **Modular Rewards:** Quest rewards are defined using a struct (`QuestReward`) that can specify different token types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) and amounts/IDs.
7.  **Reviewer Role:** Quests have a dedicated review phase and an assigned reviewer role (managed by governance), separating the completion proposal from the approval.
8.  **Liquid Democracy (Vote Delegation):** Members can delegate their combined token/reputation voting power to another member.
9.  **Arbitrary Proposal Execution with Whitelisting:** Governance proposals can trigger any function call on the contract itself or on a limited set of explicitly whitelisted external contracts. This provides powerful extensibility while mitigating risk via whitelisting.
10. **Configurable Parameters:** Many core parameters (`STAKE_REQUIRED`, `VOTING_THRESHOLD`, `REPUTATION_PER_DAY`, etc.) are stored in a generic mapping and can be updated via governance proposals, allowing the guild to evolve its rules without code upgrades.
11. **Role-Based Access Control (Partial):** While most critical actions require governance proposals, some internal processes (like assigning a quest reviewer or slashing reputation) might be directly executable by specific roles (`ELDER_ROLE`, `GOVERNANCE_ROLE`) if the proposal logic dictates calling those functions. This adds a layer of organizational structure beyond pure flat governance.
12. **Internal Token Logic (Placeholder):** Assumes interaction with a specific Guild Token contract (`IInternalGuildToken`) that handles minting/burning, allowing the DAG governance to control token supply dynamics. (Note: In this example, the interface `IInternalGuildToken` and its use imply an external token contract, although the example code contains placeholder `mint` and `burn` calls which would need to interact with that external contract).

**Limitations/Considerations (as noted in comments):**

*   Storing `memberAddresses` and `openQuestIds` in dynamic arrays can become prohibitively expensive for large numbers of members/quests due to gas costs of array modifications (add/remove). Real-world contracts often use alternative patterns (mappings to structs with a boolean flag, iterating through a range of IDs if IDs are sequential, etc.).
*   The simple role system implementation is less robust than OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`.
*   Bootstrapping the initial `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` requires a separate mechanism or trusted setup.
*   The passive reputation accrual method is simplified; a more complex system might use snapshots or continuous calculation.
*   The quorum requirement for governance proposals is mentioned but not fully implemented in the example code's `checkProposalState` for brevity.
*   Handling ETH transfers directly in `receive`/`fallback` is standard, but managing ERC20/ERC721 deposits requires users to call specific `depositTreasury`/`fundQuest` functions after approving the contract.

This contract is significantly more complex than standard examples and incorporates several advanced concepts relevant to building decentralized communities and economies on-chain. It meets the requirement of having well over 20 distinct functions.
