/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling collaborative art creation,
 * governance, and NFT ownership management. This contract aims to foster a community-driven art ecosystem
 * with advanced features for proposal-based decision making, dynamic membership, and innovative art creation mechanisms.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `applyForMembership(string memory _artistStatement)`: Allows an address to apply for membership with an artist statement.
 *    - `voteOnMembershipApplication(address _applicant, bool _approve)`: Allows current members to vote on membership applications.
 *    - `checkMembershipStatus(address _member)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows the contract owner (or DAO governance later) to revoke membership.
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 *
 * **2. Art Proposal & Creation:**
 *    - `submitArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to submit art proposals.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on art proposals.
 *    - `contributeToArt(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _contributionData)`: Allows members to contribute data (e.g., IPFS hash of art part) to an approved art proposal.
 *    - `finalizeArt(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposal submitter (or designated role) to finalize the art after contributions are collected.
 *    - `getArtProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art proposal.
 *    - `getProposalContributionCount(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the number of contributions received for a proposal.
 *
 * **3. NFT Minting & Ownership:**
 *    - `mintArtNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints an NFT representing the finalized art, owned by the collective initially.
 *    - `transferArtNFTToMember(uint256 _proposalId, address _member)`:  Allows transferring ownership of a specific art NFT to a member (e.g., as reward or through a voting mechanism - not implemented in detail here, but function exists as a hook).
 *    - `getArtNFTOwner(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the owner of the NFT associated with a specific art proposal.
 *    - `getNFTContractAddress()`: Returns the address of the deployed NFT contract (assuming separate NFT contract for art pieces - for scalability and modularity).
 *
 * **4. Collective Governance & Treasury (Simplified):**
 *    - `setMembershipVoteDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows owner to set the duration for membership voting.
 *    - `setArtProposalVoteDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows owner to set the duration for art proposal voting.
 *    - `withdrawTreasury(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows owner to withdraw funds from the contract treasury (simplified treasury management).
 *    - `getContractBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the contract treasury.
 *
 * **5. Utility & Information:**
 *    - `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.
 *    - `getContractOwner()`: Returns the address of the contract owner.
