/**
 * @title Fractionalized NFT Governance and Dynamic Metadata Contract
 * @author Your Name (or pseudonym)
 * @dev This contract implements fractionalized ownership of an NFT, enabling governance through token holders
 *      and dynamic metadata updates driven by on-chain voting.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *  -  **NFT Ownership Fractionalization:** Divides ownership into ERC20 tokens.
 *  -  **Governance:**  Token holders vote on proposals to update the NFT's metadata.
 *  -  **Dynamic Metadata:**  NFT metadata (URI) can be updated through successful governance proposals.
 *  -  **Emergency Brake:** Owner can freeze all the operation except NFT transfer and ERC20 token transfer.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *  -  `constructor(address _nftContract, uint256 _nftTokenId, string memory _initialBaseURI, string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol, uint256 _initialSupply)`: Deploys the contract, fractionalizing the specified NFT.
 *  -  `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Transfers the NFT's ownership to this contract. Only callable by the current NFT owner.
 *  -  `createProposal(string memory _description, string memory _newBaseURI)`: Creates a new metadata update proposal. Requires a deposit of governance tokens.
 *  -  `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on a proposal.
 *  -  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes and the voting period has ended. Updates the NFT's base URI.
 *  -  `tokenURI()`:  Returns the current token URI of the NFT.
 *  -  `withdrawGovernanceTokens()`: Allow users to withdraw their deposited governance tokens after the proposal end time
 *  -  `EmergencyStop()`: Stops all operations except NFT transfer and ERC20 token transfer. Only callable by the contract owner.
 *  -  `EmergencyStart()`: Restarts the all operations. Only callable by the contract owner.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  The code starts with a comprehensive outline and function summary as requested, making it easy to understand the contract's purpose and capabilities at a glance.
* **NFT Fractionalization with ERC20:**  It fractionalizes the NFT by creating an ERC20 token that represents ownership. The `constructor` mints these tokens to the initial owner (deployer).
* **Governance Mechanism:** Implements a proposal and voting system:
    * `createProposal`: Allows anyone holding enough governance tokens to create a proposal.  Requires a token deposit which is burned and recorded.
    * `vote`:  Allows token holders to vote on proposals. Stores the vote and weight.
    * `executeProposal`: Executes a proposal if it passes.  It includes quorum check and requires owner call.
* **Dynamic Metadata:** The `baseURI` is updated via the governance process. The `tokenURI` function combines the base URI with the token ID to provide the dynamic metadata.
* **Emergency Stop Mechanism:** The `EmergencyStop` and `EmergencyStart` functions provide a way for the contract owner to pause the contract in case of an emergency (vulnerability discovered, attack in progress, etc.).  Crucially, *NFT transfer from the contract is still allowed* via `transferOwnership` so you don't lose access to the NFT, and ERC20 token transfer function is still allowed so that you can recover the token when needed.  This uses a modifier to prevent state changes.
* **Withdraw Governance Token Deposit:** The `withdrawGovernanceTokens` function allows a proposal creator to reclaim their deposited governance tokens after the voting period ends.
* **OpenZeppelin Imports:** Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC20 functionality, Ownable (access control), and Strings (for URI construction).  This enhances security and reduces the risk of common vulnerabilities.
* **Events:** Emits events for important actions, making it easier to track what's happening in the contract.
* **Clear Error Messages:** Uses descriptive error messages to help users understand why a transaction failed.
* **Voting Weight:** Voting power is proportional to the amount of ERC20 tokens the voter holds.
* **Quorum:** Requires a certain percentage of the total supply to vote YES for a proposal to pass. This prevents a small number of token holders from controlling the NFT's metadata.  The quorum is set at 50% in this example, but can be changed.
* **Voting Period:** Defines a voting period during which token holders can vote on a proposal.  This prevents proposals from being executed too quickly.
* **Security Considerations:** Includes basic security checks, such as requiring sufficient balance for creating proposals and preventing double voting.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The code avoids unnecessary loops and uses efficient data structures.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the `FractionalizedNFTGovernance` contract, providing the NFT contract address, NFT token ID, initial base URI, token name, token symbol, and initial supply of governance tokens.
2.  **Transfer NFT Ownership:** Call the `transferOwnership` function on the NFT contract, transferring ownership to the `FractionalizedNFTGovernance` contract.
3.  **Create Proposals:** Governance token holders can create proposals to update the NFT's metadata using the `createProposal` function.
4.  **Vote:** Governance token holders can vote on proposals using the `vote` function.
5.  **Execute Proposals:** If a proposal passes and the voting period has ended, the contract owner can execute it using the `executeProposal` function.
6.  **Get Token URI:**  Use the `tokenURI` function to get the current metadata URI for the NFT.

This contract provides a robust framework for fractionalizing NFT ownership and enabling community-driven governance of NFT metadata.  It combines several advanced Solidity concepts to create a compelling and useful application. Remember to thoroughly audit and test this contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider adding additional security measures and gas optimization techniques as needed.
