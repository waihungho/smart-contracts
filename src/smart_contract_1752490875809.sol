Okay, let's design a complex, advanced, and creative smart contract focusing on decentralized funding for public goods or environmental projects, incorporating elements of DAO governance, staking, dynamic state based on project progress, and a unique 'Impact Point' system. We'll call it `EcoFundDAO`.

This contract won't be a direct copy of common open-source DAOs or funding platforms; it will combine several concepts uniquely.

Here's the structure:

**Contract Name:** `EcoFundDAO`

**Purpose:** A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for funding environmental or public goods projects. Users can stake governance tokens (`ECOG`), propose projects, vote on proposals, donate funds (ETH or other ERC20s), and track project progress. Projects receive funding based on verified milestones. Donors and participants earn non-transferable 'Impact Points'.

**Key Features:**
*   DAO Governance (Proposal & Voting)
*   Staking for Voting Power & Rewards
*   Multi-currency Donations (ETH & ERC20)
*   Project Lifecycle Management (Proposal -> Approval -> Funded -> Milestones -> Completion)
*   Milestone-Based Funding Release
*   Verifier Role for Milestone Confirmation
*   Unique Non-Transferable 'Impact Points' System for Participation & Donations
*   Delegation of Voting Power
*   Treasury Management via DAO Proposals

**Data Structures:**
*   `Proposal`: Details about a project proposal (title, description, requested amount, milestones, proposer, state, vote counts, voting period).
*   `Project`: Details about an approved project (based on a proposal, recipient, budget, current funding, milestones, state).
*   `Milestone`: Details about a project milestone (description, budget allocation, state).
*   `UserStake`: Tracks staked amount and voting power.
*   `UserVotes`: Tracks user's vote on specific proposals.

**States:**
*   `ProposalState`: Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed, Executed, Canceled.
*   `ProjectState`: Proposed, Approved, Active, Completed, Canceled, Suspended.
*   `MilestoneState`: Pending, SubmittedForVerification, Verified, Rejected, Paid.

**Events:** Significant actions like proposals, votes, donations, funding releases, milestone status changes, staking, etc.

**Roles:**
*   `Owner`: Contract deployer (minimal admin functions, primarily initial setup).
*   `Verifier`: Account(s) authorized to verify project milestone completion.
*   `Staker`: User staking ECOG tokens.
*   `Proposer`: User creating proposals.
*   `Voter`: User voting on proposals (requires staked ECOG or delegation).
*   `Donor`: User donating funds.
*   `ProjectRecipient`: Account designated to receive project funds per milestone.

**Functions Summary (20+ functions):**

1.  `constructor(address _ecoGovernanceToken)`: Initializes the contract with the ECOG token address. Sets owner.
2.  `stakeECOG(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to stake `ECOG` tokens to gain voting power and potential future rewards.
3.  `unstakeECOG(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to unstake `ECOG` tokens. May have a cooldown.
4.  `delegateVotingPower(address delegatee)`: Delegates the caller's voting power to another address.
5.  `revokeDelegation()`: Revokes any active delegation, returning voting power to the caller.
6.  `getVotingPower(address account)`: Returns the current voting power of an account (staked amount + delegated).
7.  `proposeProject(...)`: Allows a staker (with sufficient stake) to create a new project proposal with budget breakdown and milestones.
8.  `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific proposal.
9.  `viewActiveProposals()`: Returns a list of proposal IDs currently in the Active voting state.
10. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Allows a staker or delegatee to cast a vote on an active proposal.
11. `getVoteInfo(uint256 proposalId, address voter)`: Returns the vote cast by a specific voter on a proposal.
12. `checkProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal.
13. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Can be called by anyone after the voting period ends for a successful proposal to create a Project.
14. `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows the proposer (or perhaps a DAO vote) to cancel a pending or active proposal.
15. `donateETH()`: Allows anyone to donate native currency (ETH) to the treasury.
16. `donateERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone to donate a specified ERC20 token to the treasury.
17. `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the total ETH balance held by the contract.
18. `getERC20TreasuryBalance(address tokenAddress)`: Returns the balance of a specific ERC20 token held by the contract.
19. `viewApprovedProjects()`: Returns a list of project IDs that have been approved and are Active.
20. `getProjectDetails(uint256 projectId)`: Returns details of an approved project.
21. `getProjectMilestones(uint256 projectId)`: Returns a list of milestone details for a project.
22. `reportMilestoneCompletion(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneId)`: Allows the designated project recipient to mark a specific milestone as completed, submitting it for verification.
23. `verifyMilestoneCompletion(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneId, bool verified)`: *Only callable by Verifiers* to confirm or reject a reported milestone completion.
24. `claimMilestonePayment(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneId)`: Allows the project recipient to claim the funds for a milestone *after* it has been successfully verified.
25. `getMilestoneDetails(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneId)`: Get detailed information about a specific milestone.
26. `getImpactPoints(address account)`: Returns the total Impact Points accumulated by an account.
27. `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal(address recipient, uint256 amount, string memory reason)`: Allows a staker to propose a withdrawal from the treasury for operational costs or other DAO-approved purposes (triggers a new DAO proposal).
28. `setVerifier(address account)`: *Owner/DAO callable* - adds an address to the list of authorized verifiers.
29. `removeVerifier(address account)`: *Owner/DAO callable* - removes an address from the list of authorized verifiers.
30. `isVerifier(address account)`: Checks if an address is currently an authorized verifier.

        // Let's simplify: voting power is the stake *if* delegatee is self. If delegatee is different, the power is 0 for the delegator.
        // The delegatee receives power from those who delegated *to* them. This requires iterating or a lookup.
        // Let's use a simpler model for this example: Voting power is only the user's *own* stake if they *haven't* delegated. If they *have* delegated, their power is 0, and the delegatee's power increases off-chain or requires a more complex vote counting mechanism.
        // Let's use the Governor pattern approach: User's voting power is their own stake *unless* they have a delegatee set, in which case their power is zero. The delegatee accumulates power from those who delegate *to them*. This requires tracking delegation in reverse or iterating, which is gas-intensive.
        // Alternative simple model: `userStakes[account].amount` is the stake. `userStakes[account].delegatee` is who they delegated *to*. Voting power for casting a vote comes from whoever has the power *at the time of voting*.
        // The `getVotingPower` function should show the power available *to cast votes*.
        // A common way is to calculate total delegated power *to* someone is needed only during vote counting.
        // For this view function, let's return the user's *own* stake. The actual voting logic will need to sum up delegated power for the delegatee.
        // A truly correct Governor implementation requires tracking checkpoints of voting power. Let's simplify significantly for this example's complexity goal, assuming current stake matters.

        // Simplified Voting Power for this view function: It's the amount staked *if* the user hasn't delegated away.

Calculating total delegated power to an address requires iterating over all users or maintaining a complex mapping, which is omitted here for simplicity.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Hybrid Funding Model:** Combines standard donations (ETH/ERC20) with a structured, milestone-based distribution system tied to approved projects.
2.  **Decentralized Project Lifecycle:** Manages projects from proposal through voting, creation, milestone tracking, verification, and payment directly on-chain, governed by DAO votes and a separate verifier role.
3.  **Milestone-Based Funding:** Funds are not released upfront but tied to verifiable progress markers (`MilestoneState`), adding accountability.
4.  **Verifier Role:** Introduces a specific role (`onlyVerifier`) for off-chain verification of milestones, bridging the gap between on-chain logic and real-world project execution without fully centralizing verification (ideally, verifiers are themselves selected/governed by the DAO).
5.  **Impact Points:** A novel non-transferable point system rewards various forms of participation (donations, voting), creating a reputation or engagement metric specific to the DAO's impact goals, distinct from governance power.
6.  **Staking and Delegation:** Uses standard staking for voting power but explicitly includes delegation, a key feature for larger DAOs to encourage participation. The simplified voting power calculation in `getVotingPower` is noted as a simplification for this example; a production DAO needs snapshotting.
7.  **Treasury Management via DAO:** The `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal` function forces any non-project spending from the treasury to go through the full DAO proposal and voting process, ensuring decentralized control over all funds. This required modifying the core `executeProposal` logic to handle different proposal types.
8.  **Dynamic Proposal/Project Data:** Structs capture detailed information about proposals and projects, including dynamic state changes and lists of milestones.
9.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Used standard security pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks during transfers.
10. **Ownable (Limited Use):** Used primarily for initial setup (`constructor`) and setting/removing verifiers. The intention is for the DAO itself to take over governance of parameters and verifiers through proposals if desired, moving beyond simple `Ownable`.
11. **SafeERC20:** Ensures safe interactions with ERC20 tokens.
12. **State Machine:** Explicitly uses enums (`ProposalState`, `ProjectState`, `MilestoneState`) to manage the lifecycle and enforce correct transitions for proposals, projects, and milestones.

This contract goes beyond a basic crowdfunding or simple voting contract by integrating these elements into a cohesive system for decentralized environmental funding with built-in accountability mechanisms and unique participant incentives.
