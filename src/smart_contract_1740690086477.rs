/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Training
 * @author [Your Name/Organization]
 * @dev This contract implements a DAO that facilitates collaborative AI model training.
 *      It allows members to propose, vote on, and fund AI model training initiatives.
 *      Key features include:
 *          - Proposal Submission: Members can submit proposals detailing AI model training projects.
 *          - Voting: A weighted voting system allows members to vote on proposals based on their token holdings.
 *          - Funding Mechanism: Proposals that pass receive funding from a dedicated DAO treasury.
 *          - Reward Distribution: Successful AI models trained using DAO resources reward contributors proportional to their involvement.
 *          - Data Ownership & Governance: A system to manage and grant access to the training datasets used.
 *          - Model Versioning and Review: Tracks different versions of the AI models and allows members to review them.
 *          - Dynamic Contribution Scoring:  A system that rewards different types of contributions (data, code, compute) differently and dynamically.
 *
 *  Function Summary:
 *      - submitProposal(string memory _description, address _targetModelContract, uint256 _fundingTarget, address[] memory _dataAccessRequest,  ContributionType[] memory _contributionRequirements, uint256[] memory _contributionAmounts): Submits a new AI training proposal.
 *      - vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _supports): Casts a vote for or against a proposal.
 *      - executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a proposal if it has passed the voting threshold and time constraint.
 *      - contributeData(uint256 _proposalId, address _dataContract):  Contributors provide access to data needed for training.
 *      - contributeCode(uint256 _proposalId, address _codeRepository): Contributors provide code for the project.
 *      - contributeCompute(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _computeUnits): Contributors offer compute resources for model training.
 *      - getProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Returns details of a specific proposal.
 *      - getVotingPower(address _member): Returns the voting power of a member.
 *      - releaseFunds(uint256 _proposalId): Releases funding from treasury to a designated address after a proposal is executed.
 *      - distributeRewards(uint256 _proposalId, address _modelContract): Distributes token rewards to contributors based on their scores if the AI training is successful.
 *      - requestDataAccess(uint256 _proposalId, address _dataContract): Requests access to a specific data contract for a particular proposal.
 *      - approveDataAccess(uint256 _proposalId, address _dataContract, address _requester): Approves a data access request by the data owner.
 *      - setContributionWeights(ContributionType _contributionType, uint256 _weight): Dynamically adjust the weighting of contribution types.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Contribution Types and Weights:**  The `ContributionType` enum and `contributionWeights` mapping allow for differentiated rewards based on the kind of contributions (data, code, compute resources). The `setContributionWeights` function allows DAO members to dynamically adjust these weights, adapting to the evolving needs of projects.  This is critical for complex AI training initiatives.

* **Contribution Tracking:** The contract diligently tracks contributions of each type per contributor within each proposal, enabling fair reward distribution.

* **Data Access Control:**  The `requestDataAccess` and `approveDataAccess` functions provide a basic mechanism for managing access to data used for training.  **Crucially, the `approveDataAccess` function requires external verification of data ownership.**  This is *essential* for security; the contract *cannot* determine ownership of arbitrary data contracts.  A separate (trusted) system must confirm ownership before calling `approveDataAccess`. This part of the contract depends on the existence of data access control implemented elsewhere, it just flags the status.

* **Reward Distribution:** The `distributeRewards` function calculates and distributes token rewards to contributors based on their relative contribution scores, considering the dynamic weights. This incentivizes contributions to successful models.

* **Dynamic Contribution Weights:** The `setContributionWeights` function enables the DAO to adjust the importance of each contribution type, allowing for optimization and adaptation.

* **Clearer State Management:**  The `ProposalState` enum and modifiers improve the clarity and robustness of the state transitions within the contract.

* **Security Considerations:**  The contract includes modifiers for access control (`onlyMember`) and state validation (`onlyProposalState`, `onlyBeforeDeadline`). It uses `call{value:}` for ETH transfers, although a potential attack surface is possible, it should be reviewed carefully.

* **Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted to facilitate off-chain monitoring and integration.

* **Treasury Management:** Explicit `daoTreasury` address.  Funds are transferred *to* a target contract for execution, not directly to a user.  This is safer.

* **Governance Token (IERC20):** The contract uses an `IERC20` interface, making it compatible with any ERC20 governance token.

* **Member Management:**  `addMember` and `removeMember` functions allow the DAO to manage its membership.

* **Re-entrancy Prevention:** The transfer of funds within the `executeProposal` function is done *after* the state has been updated to `ProposalState.Succeeded`, which helps to mitigate re-entrancy attacks.

* **Gas Optimization:** Uses `storage` keyword for frequently accessed proposal variables to reduce gas costs.

**Important Security Caveats:**

* **Data Ownership Verification:**  As mentioned above, the `approveDataAccess` function **requires external, trusted validation of data ownership**.  This is a critical security requirement.  Without it, anyone could request access to someone else's data and trick the data owner into approving it.

* **AI Model Contract Security:**  The `targetModelContract` is assumed to be trustworthy.  The DAO needs to carefully vet and audit any AI model contract before funding its training.  A malicious AI model contract could potentially drain the DAO's funds or perform other harmful actions.

* **Oracle Integration (Future):**  For more complex AI model evaluation and reward mechanisms, integrating with a trusted oracle could be beneficial.  This could allow for automated evaluation of model performance and more sophisticated reward distribution schemes.

* **Governance Token Security:**  The security of the DAO is heavily reliant on the security of the governance token contract.

* **Gas Limits:**  Be mindful of gas limits when dealing with potentially large arrays of contributions or data access requests. Consider pagination or other optimization techniques.

* **Upgradability:**  Consider using a proxy pattern to make the contract upgradable in the future.

This improved contract provides a robust and feature-rich foundation for a decentralized AI model training DAO. Remember to thoroughly audit and test the contract before deploying it to a live environment, and address the security caveats.
