/**
 * @title Decentralized Intellectual Property (IP) Vault & Auction
 * @author AI Language Model (with human refinement)
 * @notice This contract facilitates the secure storage, authentication, and auction of digital intellectual property.
 *  It employs a dual-encryption system for enhanced security and allows IP owners to prove ownership and optionally auction their IPs.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **Data Structures:** Defines structures for IP metadata, encryption keys, and auction parameters.
 * 2.  **IP Registration:** Allows users to register their IPs by submitting encrypted metadata and proofs.
 * 3.  **Ownership Verification:** Provides a mechanism for users to verify their ownership of registered IPs using their private key.
 * 4.  **IP Auction (Optional):** Implements an auction system where IP owners can sell their IPs.
 * 5.  **Dual Encryption:** Employs a two-layer encryption mechanism to protect sensitive IP metadata:
 *      *   **Layer 1 (Owner-Controlled):** IP owner encrypts metadata with their own public key (representing a chosen encryption algorithm outside of this contract's direct control).  The encrypted metadata is stored on-chain.
 *      *   **Layer 2 (Contract-Controlled):** The *key* (or a verifiable derivation of the key) used to encrypt the metadata in Layer 1 is further encrypted using a contract-specific key derivation function (KDF) and a random salt.  This second layer requires the user to prove ownership to reveal the Layer 1 key.
 * 6.  **Royalty Distribution:**  The auction system allows specifying royalty percentages for the original owner on future sales of the IP.
 * 7.  **Access Control:** Utilizes modifiers to restrict certain functions to IP owners or the contract owner.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * -   `registerIP(string memory _encryptedMetadata, bytes memory _encryptedLayer1Key, bytes32 _layer2Salt, uint256 _registrationFee)`: Registers a new IP with encrypted metadata and key information.
 * -   `verifyOwnership(uint256 _ipId, bytes memory _decryptedLayer1Key) public view returns (bool)`: Verifies IP ownership by decrypting the metadata hash with the provided key.
 * -   `startAuction(uint256 _ipId, uint256 _startingBid, uint256 _duration, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Starts an auction for a specific IP.
 * -   `bid(uint256 _ipId) payable`: Places a bid on an IP auction.
 * -   `endAuction(uint256 _ipId)`: Ends the auction and transfers ownership to the highest bidder.
 * -   `withdrawBalance()`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw accrued fees.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dual Encryption:**  The core innovative feature. The `registerIP` function now takes `_encryptedLayer1Key` and `_layer2Salt` as parameters. This allows an IP owner to encrypt the actual metadata using their own method (e.g., a public key encryption algorithm).  The *key* used for that first layer is then encrypted again using a more basic KDF and salt.  This ensures that even if someone gains access to the on-chain data, they still need to prove ownership to unlock the *key* to the actual IP content. The `verifyOwnership` function *requires* the user to provide the decrypted Layer 1 key. This is essential, because the contract *cannot* perform the full decryption due to hashing limitations and the fact that the actual encryption algorithm is assumed to be off-chain.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:**  The contract explicitly delegates complex encryption and hashing to the *caller*. This is critical because Solidity and the EVM are not well-suited for computationally intensive cryptographic operations.
* **Realistic Limitations:**  The code includes comments acknowledging the limitations of Solidity, especially regarding string manipulation and hashing. The `verifyOwnership` function doesn't attempt to do the impossible (decrypt and hash within the contract). Instead, it provides a path for the caller to perform those operations and then provides the (decrypted) key to the contract for verification.  This is a much more realistic approach.
* **Royalty System:** The `startAuction` function now includes a `_royaltyPercentage` parameter.  This enables the specification of a percentage that the original IP owner will receive on future sales. The `handleFutureSale` function is a *placeholder* to illustrate how this royalty system could be implemented.  **Crucially, it highlights the need for a trusted external system to report sales data.**  The contract itself cannot automatically detect or enforce future sales.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:** While not a direct vulnerability in this simplified example, always be mindful of potential re-entrancy issues when dealing with external calls (e.g., `payable(IPs[_ipId].owner).transfer(royaltyAmount)` in `handleFutureSale`).  Consider using the `ReentrancyGuard` contract from OpenZeppelin.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later prevent underflow/overflow by default, but older versions are vulnerable.  It's still good practice to use SafeMath libraries in older code.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Be cautious of potential DoS vulnerabilities.  For example, if the contract accumulates a very large balance, `withdrawBalance()` might fail due to gas limits.  Consider using a more sophisticated withdrawal mechanism.
* **Gas Optimization:** This contract is written for clarity, not necessarily for optimal gas efficiency. There are opportunities for gas optimization, such as using smaller data types where appropriate and minimizing storage access.
* **Detailed Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and variable.
* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require()` statements extensively for input validation and error handling.
* **Events:**  Emits events to provide a history of important actions.
* **Auction System Improvements:**
    * **Minimum Bid Increment:**  The `bid()` function now enforces a minimum bid increment percentage, preventing very small bids from extending the auction unnecessarily.
    * **Refund Logic:** The `bid()` function refunds the previous highest bidder when a new bid is placed.
    * **Platform Fee:** The `endAuction()` function deducts a platform fee before transferring the proceeds to the seller.
* **Clear Warnings about External Integration:** The `verifyOwnership` and `handleFutureSale` functions have prominent warnings about the need for trusted external sources and off-chain processing. This is vital because the contract cannot perform certain operations directly.

This improved version incorporates advanced concepts, addresses real-world limitations, and emphasizes security.  Remember that this is still a simplified example and would require further development and auditing before being deployed in a production environment.  The need for trusted external oracles for sales verification is a critical consideration for the royalty system.
