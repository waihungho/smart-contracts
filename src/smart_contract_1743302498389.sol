 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, enabling artists to submit artworks (NFTs),
 *      community governance for artwork selection and gallery operations, curated exhibitions,
 *      revenue sharing, and innovative features like collaborative artworks and dynamic pricing.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Gallery Management:**
 *   1. `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _governanceToken)`: Initializes the gallery with name and governance token address.
 *   2. `setGalleryName(string _newName)`: Allows gallery owner to change the gallery name.
 *   3. `setCuratorRole(address _curator, bool _isActive)`: Assigns or revokes curator role for an address.
 *   4. `setGovernanceToken(address _newGovernanceToken)`: Updates the governance token contract address.
 *   5. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Sets the platform fee percentage for artwork sales.
 *   6. `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows gallery owner to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *
 * **Artwork Submission & Management:**
 *   7. `submitArtwork(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string _metadataURI)`: Artists submit their NFTs for gallery consideration.
 *   8. `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators or governance approves a submitted artwork for display.
 *   9. `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators or governance rejects a submitted artwork.
 *   10. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Gallery owner or curators set the initial price for an approved artwork.
 *   11. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase an artwork displayed in the gallery.
 *   12. `removeArtworkFromGallery(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows gallery owner or curators to remove an artwork from display.
 *   13. `collaborateOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address _collaboratorArtist, uint256 _collaboratorShare)`: Artists can propose collaboration on an artwork with revenue share.
 *   14. `acceptCollaboration(uint256 _artworkId)`: Collaborator artist accepts a collaboration proposal.
 *   15. `finalizeCollaboration(uint256 _artworkId)`: Original artist finalizes the collaboration, enabling shared revenue.
 *
 * **Exhibitions & Events:**
 *   16. `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Creates a new art exhibition with a name and duration.
 *   17. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds an artwork to a specific exhibition.
 *   18. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Removes an artwork from an exhibition.
 *   19. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends an ongoing exhibition.
 *
 * **Dynamic Pricing & Community Engagement:**
 *   20. `toggleDynamicPricing(uint256 _artworkId)`: Enables/disables dynamic pricing for an artwork based on community engagement (likes/views).
 *   21. `likeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to "like" an artwork, influencing dynamic pricing.
 *   22. `viewArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Tracks artwork views for dynamic pricing consideration.
 *
 * **Data Retrieval & Utility:**
 *   23. `getGalleryName()`: Returns the name of the art gallery.
 *   24. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns detailed information about a specific artwork.
 *   25. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns details of a specific exhibition.
 *   26. `isArtworkApproved(uint256 _artworkId)`: Checks if an artwork is approved for display.
 *   27. `getPlatformFeePercentage()`: Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 *   28. `getPendingPlatformFees()`: Returns the amount of accumulated platform fees.
 *   29. `getArtworkOwner(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current owner of a specific artwork in the gallery.
