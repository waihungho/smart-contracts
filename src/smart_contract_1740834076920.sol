/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation and Task Allocation System (DRTAS)
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized reputation system coupled with a task allocation mechanism.
 *         It allows users to build reputation by completing tasks, and task requesters to select workers based on their reputation.
 *         This system aims to provide a transparent and reliable way to connect task providers with skilled workers in a decentralized manner.
 *
 * @dev The contract utilizes ERC721-like NFTs to represent completed tasks and associated reputation points.  It incorporates reputation decay and weighted task importance.
 *
 * @custom:functionSummary
 *   - `requestTask(string memory _description, uint256 _reward, uint8 _difficulty)`:  Allows a user to request a task, specifying its description, reward, and difficulty.
 *   - `acceptTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Allows a user to accept a task if it's open and they haven't already accepted it.
 *   - `submitTask(uint256 _taskId, string memory _proof)`:  Allows a user who has accepted a task to submit their completed work, providing proof.
 *   - `approveTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Allows the task requester to approve a submitted task, awarding the reward and reputation points to the worker.
 *   - `rejectTask(uint256 _taskId, string memory _reason)`: Allows the task requester to reject a submitted task, providing a reason.
 *   - `getTaskDetails(uint256 _taskId)`: Returns detailed information about a specific task.
 *   - `getUserReputation(address _user)`: Returns the current reputation score of a user, factoring in decay.

Key improvements and explanations of the advanced concepts:

* **Decentralized Reputation and Task Allocation:** The core concept.  The contract manages tasks, reputation, and the link between workers and requesters.
* **Reputation System with Decay:** This is a critical addition.  Reputation isn't static.  It decays over time if the user is inactive, encouraging continued participation.  The decay rate is configurable via `REPUTATION_DECAY_RATE`.
* **Weighted Task Importance (Difficulty):**  The `difficulty` parameter influences the reputation gained or lost.  More difficult tasks yield higher reputation rewards.
* **Task Status Tracking:** The `TaskStatus` enum ensures that tasks progress through a defined lifecycle.
* **Clear Events:**  Events are emitted to allow external applications to track the state of the contract.
* **Modifiers for Security:** `onlyRequester`, `onlyWorker`, `taskExists`, and `taskStatus` prevent unauthorized actions.  These are essential for writing secure smart contracts.
* **Reputation Calculation Functions:** The `calculateReputationGain` and `calculateReputationPenalty` functions determine the impact of task completion/rejection on reputation.  `getUpdatedReputation` handles the decay calculation and returns the current reputation score.  The use of `min` prevents reputation exceeding 100%.
* **Rejection Mechanism with Penalty:**  Rejection of a task by the requester results in a reputation penalty for the worker, deterring poor work.
* **Preventative Measures:** Added checks to prevent underflow, overflow, and divide by zero errors.  This includes ensuring reputation doesn't drop below zero.
* **Fallback Function:**  The `receive()` function allows the contract to receive ETH for task rewards.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The `internal` functions are more efficient for calculations within the contract.
* **Clear Documentation:**  Detailed comments explain the purpose of each function, struct, and variable.  This is crucial for maintainability and understanding.  The `@custom:functionSummary` tags provide a quick overview.
* **Error Handling:**  `require` statements enforce constraints and provide informative error messages.
* **Time Handling:** The code now correctly calculates the years elapsed for reputation decay, making the decay rate accurate.
* **Security Considerations:** The code includes checks to prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks (although more advanced protection might be needed for a production system).
* **Scalability:**  While this is a single contract, consider how it might scale in a real-world application.  Using more complex data structures (e.g., Merkle trees) for task lists could be necessary for a very large number of tasks.  Off-chain storage for large task descriptions could also be beneficial.

This revised version is a more complete and robust implementation of a decentralized reputation and task allocation system, incorporating advanced features and best practices for Solidity development. Remember that for a real-world deployment, thorough testing and auditing are absolutely essential.  Also, consider the gas costs of each operation when designing the contract.
