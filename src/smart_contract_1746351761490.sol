Okay, let's design a complex, interesting, and advanced smart contract. We will create a "ChronoVault" which allows depositing assets (ETH or ERC20) with highly configurable time-based and conditional release schedules. It incorporates concepts like vesting, cliff periods, optional conditions, revocability, transfer of rights, and passive claiming.

This contract is complex and designed for demonstration. **It has NOT been audited and should NOT be used in production without thorough security review.**

**Outline and Function Summary: ChronoVault Smart Contract**

This contract allows depositors to lock assets (ETH or ERC20) in time-released and conditionally-released vaults for beneficiaries.

**Core Concepts:**
1.  **Vault Entries:** Each deposit with a schedule is a unique "Vault Entry".
2.  **Configurable Release:** Supports cliff, linear vesting, or interval-based releases.
3.  **Conditional Release:** Allows specifying extra on-chain conditions that must be met *in addition* to time.
4.  **Roles:** Depositor (creator), Beneficiary (receiver), Required Signer (optional, co-condition), Admin (contract management), Owner (highest privilege).
5.  **Revocability:** Depositor can optionally revoke entries.
6.  **Transferability:** Depositor can transfer beneficiary rights.
7.  **Passive Claim:** Allows a third party to trigger a claim on behalf of the beneficiary if conditions are met and a delay has passed.
8.  **Global Conditions:** An admin can set a global flag that affects entries configured to respect it.
9.  **Emergency Withdraw:** Depositor can withdraw funds from *their* revoked entries.
10. **Unsupported Fund Recovery:** Admin can recover accidentally sent ETH/ERC20 not tied to vault entries.

**State Variables:**
*   `vaultEntries`: Mapping storing `VaultEntry` structs by beneficiary address and entry ID.
*   `beneficiaryEntryIds`: Mapping storing arrays of entry IDs for each beneficiary.
*   `_entryIdCounter`: Counter for unique entry IDs.
*   `_admin`: Address with admin privileges.
*   `globalConditionFlag`: A boolean flag controlled by the admin.

**Structs:**
*   `VaultEntry`: Defines the parameters and state of a single vault entry (depositor, asset, amounts, times, conditions, status flags).

**Events:**
*   `VaultEntryCreated`: Emitted when a new entry is created.
*   `ClaimExecuted`: Emitted when assets are claimed from an entry.
*   `EntryRevoked`: Emitted when an entry is revoked.
*   `EntryPaused`: Emitted when an entry is paused.
*   `EntryUnpaused`: Emitted when an entry is unpaused.
*   `BeneficiaryTransferred`: Emitted when beneficiary rights are transferred.
*   `FundsAddedToEntry`: Emitted when funds are added to an existing entry.
*   `EntryConditionsUpdated`: Emitted when non-time conditions are updated.
*   `DepositorEmergencyWithdraw`: Emitted when a depositor withdraws from revoked entries.
*   `GlobalConditionFlagSet`: Emitted when the global flag is set.
*   `UnsupportedFundsWithdrawn`: Emitted when unallocated funds are withdrawn.
*   `DepositorRightsTransferred`: Emitted when depositor rights are transferred for an entry.

**Functions (28+):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner and admin.
2.  `setAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Sets the admin address (Owner only).
3.  `removeAdmin()`: Removes the admin address (Owner only).
4.  `pauseContract()`: Pauses the contract globally (Admin only).
5.  `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract globally (Admin only).
6.  `setGlobalConditionFlag(bool _state)`: Sets the global condition flag (Admin only).
7.  `getGlobalConditionFlag()`: View the current state of the global condition flag.
8.  `createVaultEntry(...)`: Creates a new vault entry (Depositor). Supports ETH or ERC20.
9.  `claim(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: Allows beneficiary or required signer to claim available funds if all conditions (time, manual flag, required signer, block number, global flag) are met.
10. `triggerPassiveClaim(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: Allows *anyone* to trigger a claim for a beneficiary after a grace period *if* time and all conditions are met.
11. `revokeVaultEntry(uint256 _entryId)`: Allows the depositor to revoke an entry if `isRevocable` is true.
12. `pauseVaultEntry(uint256 _entryId)`: Allows the depositor to pause an entry.
13. `unpauseVaultEntry(uint256 _entryId)`: Allows the depositor to unpause an entry.
14. `transferBeneficiary(uint256 _entryId, address _newBeneficiary)`: Allows the depositor to transfer beneficiary rights for an entry.
15. `transferDepositorRights(uint256 _entryId, address _newDepositor)`: Allows the current depositor to transfer their depositor rights for an entry.
16. `addFundsToEntry(uint256 _entryId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the depositor to add more funds to an existing entry (ETH via `payable`, ERC20 requires prior approval).
17. `updateEntryConditions(uint256 _entryId, address _requiredSigner, uint256 _minBlockNumber, bool _requiresManualClaim, bool _affectedByGlobalFlag)`: Allows the depositor to update the non-time conditions for an entry.
18. `setExtraDataHash(uint256 _entryId, bytes32 _extraDataHash)`: Allows the depositor to set an external data hash on an entry.
19. `emergencyWithdrawDepositor(uint256 _entryId)`: Allows the depositor to withdraw remaining funds from *their* revoked entry.
20. `withdrawUnsupportedFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`: Allows the admin to withdraw tokens or ETH that were sent to the contract but are *not* associated with any active or pending vault entry.
21. `getAvailableAmount(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: View function. Calculates the amount currently claimable for an entry based on time, but *without* checking other conditions.
22. `checkEntrySpecificConditionsMet(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: View function. Checks if the *non-time* conditions (`requiredSigner`, `minBlockNumber`, `requiresManualClaim`, `affectedByGlobalFlag`) for an entry are currently met.
23. `getVaultEntryDetails(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: View function. Returns all details of a specific vault entry.
24. `getTotalDepositedForEntry(address _beneficiary, uint256 _entryId)`: View function. Returns the total amount originally deposited for an entry.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Complex Vesting Schedules:** Supports not just linear vesting and cliffs, but also interval-based unlocks.
2.  **Multiple On-Chain Conditions:** `requiredSigner`, `minBlockNumber`, `requiresManualClaim`, and `affectedByGlobalFlag` can be combined with the time schedule for nuanced release logic.
3.  **Role-Based Access & Transferability:** Distinct roles (Depositor, Beneficiary, Required Signer, Admin, Owner) with specific permissions. Allows transferring both Beneficiary rights and Depositor rights for flexibility (e.g., selling a vesting position, changing who manages a corporate grant).
4.  **Passive Claim Mechanism:** Addresses the scenario where a beneficiary is unable or unwilling to claim. After a grace period, a third party can trigger the claim on their behalf, ensuring funds aren't stuck while still sending to the correct beneficiary. This adds a layer of decentralization to the claiming process.
5.  **Global Condition Flag:** Allows the admin to implement a contract-wide override that can halt claims for entries configured to respect it (e.g., in response to a regulatory event, a security pause, or an oracle signal if integrated).
6.  **Extra Data Hash:** Provides a standard way to cryptographically link the on-chain entry to off-chain data or proofs (like a signed agreement detailing the conditions or context), enhancing transparency and trust while keeping complex data off-chain.
7.  **Emergency Withdraw for Depositor:** Allows the original depositor to recover their funds from *revoked* entries, providing a safety valve in case the vesting is cancelled.
8.  **Unsupported Fund Recovery:** Includes a mechanism for the admin to recover funds accidentally sent to the contract, a necessary utility function often overlooked.
9.  **Comprehensive View Functions:** Includes functions to inspect the status, progress, and conditions of entries in detail.
10. **Modular Design:** Uses OpenZeppelin libraries (`Ownable`, `Pausable`, `SafeERC20`) for standard access control and safe token handling, improving security and readability. The `Pausable` override for the admin demonstrates specific permissioning during a pause.

This contract combines several advanced concepts beyond a simple time-lock or linear vesting contract, offering a flexible and feature-rich platform for conditional asset distribution. Remember, real-world use would require extensive testing and professional audits.
