/**
 * @title Decentralized Art Curator (DAC) - A Smart Contract for Collaborative Art Curation and DAO-based Governance.
 * @author Bard (Generated Example)
 *
 * @dev This contract facilitates the creation of a decentralized art curation platform.  Users can submit art pieces, 
 *      the community (DAO token holders) votes on the submissions, and approved pieces are curated. 
 *      Approved art can then be featured (with curator incentives).  Royalties from any secondary sales
 *      are distributed back to the artists and a curated fund.
 *
 * @notice  This is an example and should be audited and adapted carefully for production use. It relies on ERC721
 *          standard for art pieces, and a simplified DAO token.  More robust DAO solutions could be integrated.
 *
 * Outline:
 *  - ERC721 Integration:  Allows for representing art pieces as NFTs.
 *  - Submission Process:  Allows artists to submit their NFTs for curation.
 *  - DAO Voting:  DAO token holders vote on submitted pieces.
 *  - Curation Process:  If a piece passes voting, it is "curated".
 *  - Featuring: Curators can feature curated pieces, earning incentives.
 *  - Royalty Distribution:  Royalties from secondary sales are split between the artist and a curated fund.
 *  - Governance: Basic DAO token governance for platform parameters.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - submitArt(address _artContract, uint256 _tokenId): Allows artists to submit an existing NFT for curation.
 *  - voteOnArt(uint256 _submissionId, bool _vote):  DAO token holders vote on submitted art pieces.
 *  - curateArt(uint256 _submissionId):  Allows the contract owner to finalize curation of an art piece that passed voting.
 *  - featureArt(uint256 _submissionId): Allows curators to feature a curated art piece.
 *  - setRoyalty(uint256 _submissionId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage): Set the royalty percentage for a curated artwork.
 *  - purchaseCuratedArt(uint256 _submissionId): Allows users to purchase curated art.
 *  - claimArtistRoyalty(uint256 _submissionId): Claim artist royalties from secondary sales.
 *  - claimCuratedFund(uint256 _submissionId): Claim curated fund share from secondary sales.
 *  - setFeatureReward(uint256 _reward): Sets the reward for featuring an artwork.
 *  - setQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum): Sets the percentage of votes needed to pass a proposal.
 *  - transferDAOOwnership(address _newOwner): Allows DAO token owner to transfer ownership.
 *  - emergencyWithdraw(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount): Allows contract owner to withdraw stuck ERC20/ERC721 tokens in case of emergency.

Key improvements and Explanations:

* **Detailed Comments & NatSpec Style:**  Much more thorough explanations of each function, its parameters, return values, and potential side effects.  Uses NatSpec compliant comments (starting with `///` or `/**`) to allow documentation generation tools to easily parse this code.
* **Clear Structure:**  Separation of state variables, events, modifiers, and functions for better readability.
* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require()` statements extensively to enforce preconditions and prevent unexpected behavior. Provides specific error messages to aid debugging.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * `Ownable` inheritance for privileged functions.
    * `safeTransferFrom` (for ERC721) is used, although a fully safe ERC20 implementation is not included due to the complexities and dependency imports required. A production system should *always* use the OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` library.
    *  Reentrancy attacks are not explicitly handled, *this contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks*.  A production-ready contract would need to implement reentrancy guards using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` or similar.  This is a critical security aspect.
* **DAO Token Integration (Simplified):**  Includes a basic `daoTokenBalance` mapping to simulate DAO token ownership.  *This is a very basic simulation and NOT a full DAO token implementation.* A real-world application would integrate with a more robust ERC20-based DAO token.
* **Royalty Handling:** Includes royalty mechanism for secondary sales, allowing artists to earn a percentage of future sales. Has a royalty claim function to be executed by an artist.
* **Curated Fund:** Contains a curated fund share mechanism allowing a percentage to be sent to the community fund on secondary sales.
* **Emergency Withdrawal:** Includes a function to withdraw tokens in case of emergency. The function attempts to determine if the token is ERC721 or ERC20 and withdraws accordingly.  Uses a `try/catch` block and checks for the ERC721 `ownerOf` function.  *This function requires careful testing and should be used with extreme caution*.
* **Events:** Emits events for important state changes to allow off-chain monitoring.
* **Gas Optimization (Limited):** While not heavily optimized, the code avoids unnecessary storage reads/writes.  More advanced techniques could be applied, but clarity was prioritized.
* **ERC721 Compliant:** Implements the ERC721 interface for the art tokens.

**Important Considerations for Production:**

* **Security Audit:** *This contract MUST undergo a professional security audit before deployment to a production environment.*  The potential vulnerabilities, especially around reentrancy, token transfers, and DAO token integration, need to be thoroughly assessed.
* **DAO Token Implementation:**  Replace the simplified `daoTokenBalance` with a robust ERC20-based DAO token contract. Consider using existing DAO frameworks like Aragon or Colony.
* **Marketplace Integration:**  The `purchaseCuratedArt` function is very basic.  Integrate with a proper marketplace contract to handle order matching, escrow, and token transfers securely.
* **Reentrancy Protection:**  Implement reentrancy guards to prevent malicious contracts from exploiting vulnerabilities.
* **Gas Optimization:**  Optimize the contract for gas efficiency to reduce transaction costs.
* **Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit tests to cover all functionalities and edge cases.
* **Upgradability:**  Consider using upgradeable contract patterns (e.g., proxy contracts) if you anticipate needing to modify the contract logic in the future.
* **Access Control:**  Review and refine the access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.
* **Token Standards:** Consider using a more advanced ERC721 standard like ERC721A for cheaper minting.
* **Off-Chain Metadata:** Implement a mechanism to handle off-chain metadata for the NFTs.

This revised response provides a more complete and secure smart contract, addressing the user's request for advanced concepts and security considerations.  Remember that smart contract development requires careful planning, implementation, and testing.
