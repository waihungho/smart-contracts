**SyntheticaNexus Protocol: Adaptive Strategy Vault**

**Outline & Function Summary:**

The `SyntheticaNexus` contract is a sophisticated, self-optimizing, and community-driven treasury management system. It enables decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and advanced users to manage diverse asset portfolios through a framework of dynamically adaptable strategies. It incorporates concepts of "Proof of Strategy" (PoSg), performance-based incentives, and a modular architecture for strategy integration, aiming to be unique by focusing on comprehensive strategy lifecycle management and adaptive economic models.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Adaptive Strategies:** Strategies are not static but can be proposed, evaluated, adopted, modified, and retired based on market conditions, performance, and governance consensus.
*   **Proof of Strategy (PoSg):** Incentivizes expert contribution by rewarding strategy proposers whose strategies perform exceptionally well and are adopted by the community. Reputation mechanics are integrated.
*   **Dynamic Fee Models:** Management and performance fees can adjust automatically or via governance based on the vault's profitability, market volatility, and overall protocol health.
*   **Modular Design:** Allows for easy integration and removal of various investment strategies, which are external contracts adhering to a defined interface, fostering innovation.
*   **Emergency Safeguards:** Built-in mechanisms for rapid fund protection during market crises or detected anomalies.

**Function List (Total: 25 Functions):**

**I. Vault & Asset Management (Core)**
1.  `deposit(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to deposit supported tokens into the vault, receiving vault shares in return.
2.  `withdraw(uint256 _shares, address _tokenOut)`: Allows users to burn their vault shares to withdraw a proportional amount of a specified token from the vault.
3.  `getTotalValueLocked()`: Returns the total value locked across all assets in a base currency (e.g., USD, ETH) using an oracle.
4.  `getAssetBalance(address _token)`: Returns the current balance of a specific token held directly by the vault.
5.  `getStrategyAllocatedBalance(bytes32 _strategyId)`: Returns the amount of vault capital currently allocated to a specific active strategy.

**II. Strategy Lifecycle Management (Advanced & Unique)**
6.  `proposeStrategy(string calldata _name, address _moduleAddress, bytes calldata _initialParams, string calldata _descriptionURI)`: Allows a user to propose a new investment strategy, linking to an external strategy module contract and its initial parameters. Includes a URI for off-chain description/documentation.
7.  `voteOnStrategyProposal(bytes32 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Enables community members to vote on a proposed strategy, using a weighted voting system based on their voting power (e.g., staked tokens or reputation).
8.  `activateStrategy(bytes32 _proposalId)`: Executed by governance after a successful vote; transitions a proposed strategy to an 'active' state, making it available for capital allocation.
9.  `deactivateStrategy(bytes32 _strategyId)`: Allows governance to deactivate an active strategy, preventing further capital allocation and preparing for fund withdrawal from it.
10. `allocateToStrategy(bytes32 _strategyId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows governance to allocate a specified amount of *available* vault capital to an active strategy.
11. `rebalanceStrategyAllocation(bytes32[] calldata _strategyIds, uint256[] calldata _newAllocations)`: Allows governance to redistribute capital across multiple active strategies based on new target amounts.
12. `updateStrategyParameters(bytes32 _strategyId, bytes calldata _newParams)`: Allows governance to update configurable parameters of an already active strategy module (e.g., risk limits, target APY).
13. `requestStrategyPerformanceReport(bytes32 _strategyId)`: Triggers an internal or oracle-based evaluation of a strategy's performance, updating its recorded metrics for rewards/penalties. (This would likely be called by an authorized keeper or governance).

**III. Dynamic Fee & Incentive System (Innovative)**
14. `claimStrategyRewards(bytes32 _strategyId)`: Allows the original proposer of a highly successful (as determined by performance metrics and governance approval) and adopted strategy to claim their earned performance-based rewards.
15. `adjustFeeTier(uint256 _newManagementFeeBPS, uint256 _newPerformanceFeeBPS)`: Allows governance to dynamically adjust the vault's overall management and performance fees based on market conditions, strategy performance, or protocol needs.
16. `setPerformanceThresholds(uint256 _rewardThresholdBPS, uint256 _penaltyThresholdBPS)`: Defines the performance thresholds that trigger rewards for proposers or potential penalties/deactivation for underperforming strategies.

**IV. Governance & Reputation (Advanced DAO aspects)**
17. `slashProposerReputation(address _proposer, uint256 _amount)`: Allows governance to penalize a strategy proposer by reducing their on-chain reputation score, typically for proposing a malicious or severely underperforming strategy.
18. `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Allows a user to delegate their voting power for strategy proposals and other governance actions to another address.
19. `getCurrentVotingPower(address _voter)`: Returns the current aggregate voting power of a given address, combining factors like staked tokens and accumulated reputation.

**V. Emergency & Safety Mechanisms (Robustness)**
20. `triggerEmergencyWithdrawal(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Allows an authorized emergency guardian to immediately withdraw specified tokens to a predefined safe address during critical situations (e.g., detected exploit, severe market crash).
21. `setEmergencyGuardian(address _newGuardian)`: Allows ownership/governance to update the address authorized to trigger emergency withdrawals.
22. `pauseOperations()`: Allows ownership/governance to pause critical operations of the contract (deposits, strategy allocations, withdrawals) in case of an exploit, bug, or upgrade.
23. `unpauseOperations()`: Allows ownership/governance to resume operations after a pause.

**VI. Oracle & External Data Integration (Conceptual / Simulative)**
24. `setOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Sets the address of the price oracle contract responsible for fetching external market data and asset valuations.
25. `updateMarketConditions(uint256 _volatilityIndex, uint256 _riskScore)`: (Simulative, or called by an authorized keeper/oracle) Updates internal state variables reflecting overall market volatility and risk scores, which can influence dynamic fees, strategy rebalancing, or emergency protocols.
