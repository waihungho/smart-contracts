Okay, let's design a smart contract that serves as a "Digital Legacy Vault". This contract will allow a user to deposit various digital assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), configure trusted executors and heirs, and define conditions (based on inactivity) under which these assets can be securely released to the heirs after a confirmation process by the executors.

This incorporates several advanced concepts:
1.  **State Machine:** The contract operates through distinct lifecycle states.
2.  **Time-Based Triggers:** Using `block.timestamp` to detect inactivity and enforce delays.
3.  **Multi-Party Confirmation:** Requiring a threshold of trusted executors to confirm a state (e.g., owner's inactivity implies incapacity or death) before assets become releasable.
4.  **Multi-Asset Handling:** Managing and distributing different types of tokens (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).
5.  **Configurable Parameters:** Allowing the owner to set inactivity thresholds, confirmation requirements, and release delays.
6.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiating between the owner, executors, and heirs.
7.  **Secure Release Mechanism:** Assets are only released after specific conditions (inactivity + executor confirmations + delay) are met.
8.  **Owner Override:** The owner can always cancel the legacy process and reclaim assets while alive and capable.

This is not a direct copy of standard OpenZeppelin contracts (like Vesting, Timelock, or basic Escrow) and combines multiple ideas into one system.

### **Smart Contract Outline & Summary: `DigitalLegacyVault`**

**Contract Name:** `DigitalLegacyVault`

**Purpose:** To provide a secure, on-chain mechanism for a user (the Owner) to store digital assets and configure their distribution to designated Heirs upon certain conditions being met, verified by trusted Executors, typically related to the Owner's prolonged inactivity.

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Owner:** The creator and primary controller of the vault.
*   **Heirs:** Addresses designated to receive assets upon release.
*   **Executors:** Trusted addresses who can confirm the Owner's status (inactivity/incapacity/death).
*   **State Machine:** The vault progresses through different states (`Setup`, `Active`, `InactivityDetected`, `ConfirmationPhase`, `ReadyForRelease`, `Released`, `Cancelled`).
*   **Time Locks:** Inactivity period, confirmation window, release delay.
*   **Multi-Sig Confirmation:** A minimum number of Executors must confirm the Owner's status.
*   **Multi-Asset Support:** Handles ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Address of the vault creator.
*   `vaultState`: Current state of the vault (enum).
*   `heirs`: Mapping of heir addresses to their percentage share of *distributable* assets.
*   `heirAddresses`: Array to list heir addresses for iteration.
*   `executors`: Mapping of executor addresses to boolean indicating if they are an executor.
*   `executorAddresses`: Array to list executor addresses for iteration.
*   `confirmedExecutors`: Mapping of executor addresses to boolean indicating if they have confirmed the owner's status during the current cycle.
*   `executorConfirmationsCount`: Counter for the number of required confirmations received in the current cycle.
*   `inactivityThreshold`: Duration of inactivity required to trigger detection.
*   `confirmationThreshold`: Minimum number of executor confirmations needed.
*   `confirmationPeriod`: Time window for executors to confirm after inactivity is detected.
*   `releaseDelay`: Time delay after confirmations before assets can be released.
*   `lastOwnerActivity`: Timestamp of the owner's last registered activity.
*   `inactivityDetectedTime`: Timestamp when inactivity threshold was met.
*   `confirmationCompletionTime`: Timestamp when confirmation threshold was reached.
*   `supportedERC20s`: Mapping to track ERC20 token addresses intended for legacy distribution.
*   `supportedERC20Addresses`: Array to list supported ERC20 addresses.
*   `supportedERC721s`: Mapping to track ERC721 token addresses intended for legacy distribution.
*   `supportedERC721Addresses`: Array to list supported ERC721 addresses.
*   `supportedERC1155s`: Mapping to track ERC1155 token addresses intended for legacy distribution.
*   `supportedERC1155Addresses`: Array to list supported ERC1155 addresses.
*   `erc1155SupportedTokenIds`: Mapping to track specific ERC1155 token IDs supported for a given token address (`address => mapping(uint256 => bool)`).
*   `erc721CollectionReceivers`: Mapping to designate a specific heir for an entire ERC721 collection (`address => address`).
