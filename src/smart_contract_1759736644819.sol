This smart contract, **SynergyGridCore**, introduces a novel decentralized protocol focusing on adaptive reputation, dynamic resource allocation, and self-governing parameter evolution. It moves beyond static identities and fixed rules by allowing the core mechanics of the protocol to be shaped by its participants through a reputation-weighted governance system.

**Key Advanced Concepts:**

*   **Dynamic & Adaptive Reputation (SBT-like):** Users register a non-transferable "Reputation Profile" whose score is dynamic, evolving based on on-chain actions, verifiable attestations, and a time-decay mechanism. The formula for this score can be adjusted by governance.
*   **Reputation-Weighted Resource Allocation:** Users earn "Resource Credits" (an internal, fungible token) at a rate proportional to their reputation score, incentivizing positive contributions. These credits are used for protocol interactions.
*   **Self-Adjusting Protocol Parameters:** A unique governance module allows proposals to *change the very formulas* that dictate reputation decay, attestation value, resource credit emission, and voting thresholds, making the protocol truly adaptive.
*   **Time-Decaying & Delegated Attestations:** Users can submit verifiable claims ("attestations") that boost reputation. These attestations can have expiry dates, and high-reputation users can delegate their attestation power.
*   **Challenge & Dispute Resolution:** A system for users to challenge another's reputation, backed by staked Resource Credits and resolved through reputation-weighted voting, with rewards/penalties impacting both reputation and staked funds.
*   **ZK-Proof Integration (Conceptual):** The contract includes hooks for integrating Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification for private attestations, hinting at future privacy-preserving features.

## SynergyGrid Protocol: Adaptive Reputation & Resource Layer

**Contract Name:** `SynergyGridCore`

**Concept:** A decentralized protocol fostering adaptive reputation, dynamic resource allocation, and self-governing parameter evolution based on on-chain contributions and attestations. It combines non-transferable "Reputation Profiles" (SBT-like) with transferable "Resource Credits" and features a novel adaptive governance mechanism. The protocol aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where user actions and verifiable claims influence their standing and access to protocol resources, with the rules themselves being subject to adaptive, reputation-weighted governance.

### Outline & Function Summary

**I. Core Identity & Reputation Management**
*   **`registerProfile()`**: Allows a new user to mint their unique, non-transferable Reputation Profile (SBT-like).
*   **`getReputationScore(address user)`**: Retrieves the current dynamic reputation score for a given user, applying decay if applicable.
*   **`_updateReputation(address user, int256 change)`**: *Internal* function to safely adjust a user's reputation score based on protocol interactions, handling decay and minimum score.
*   **`getProfileCreationTimestamp(address user)`**: Returns the timestamp when a user's Reputation Profile was initially created.
*   **`burnProfile()`**: Enables a user to irrevocably burn their Reputation Profile, subject to conditions like no active stakes.
*   **`isReputationScoreFrozen(address user)`**: Checks if a user's reputation score is temporarily frozen (e.g., during an ongoing challenge).

**II. Attestation & Claim Verification**
*   **`submitAttestation(uint256 attestationType, bytes32 attestationHash, uint64 expiryTimestamp, bytes calldata proofData)`**: Allows users or designated entities to submit verifiable claims or attestations (e.g., skill, contribution). `proofData` can optionally contain ZKP-related data.
*   **`revokeAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash)`**: Enables the original attester to revoke a previously submitted attestation, potentially incurring a reputation penalty.
*   **`verifyZKPAttestation(bytes32 attestationHash, bytes calldata zkpProof, bytes32 publicInputsHash)`**: A *conceptual external* function to verify a Zero-Knowledge Proof associated with an attestation, validating private claims (simulated for this demo).
*   **`getAttestationDetails(bytes32 attestationHash)`**: Provides structured details of a specific attestation.
*   **`delegateAttestationPower(address delegatee, uint256 attestationType)`**: Allows a high-reputation user to delegate their authority to submit specific types of attestations to another address.

**III. Resource & Incentive Layer (Resource Credits)**
*   **`claimResourceCredits()`**: Allows users to claim periodic Resource Credits, with the amount being weighted by their current reputation score and subject to a cooldown.
*   **`getResourceCreditsBalance(address user)`**: Returns the current balance of Resource Credits for a user.
*   **`transferResourceCredits(address recipient, uint256 amount)`**: Facilitates the transfer of Resource Credits between users.
*   **`stakeResourceCredits(uint256 amount, uint224 purposeIdentifier)`**: Users can stake Resource Credits for various protocol activities, like initiating proposals or challenges. Returns the stake ID.
*   **`unstakeResourceCredits(uint256 stakeId)`**: Enables users to unstake their previously staked Resource Credits, provided they are not actively locked in a process.

**IV. Adaptive Governance & Parameter Adjustment**
*   **`submitParameterProposal(string calldata description, bytes calldata newParametersEncoded)`**: Allows qualified users to propose changes to core protocol parameters (e.g., reputation decay rate, resource credit emission formula). Requires minimum reputation and a stake.
*   **`voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`**: Users cast their vote on active parameter proposals, with voting power weighted by their current reputation score.
*   **`executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`**: Executes a proposal once it has passed the voting phase and met quorum requirements, applying the encoded parameter changes.
*   **`getCurrentReputationFormulaParams()`**: Returns the currently active parameters that govern reputation calculation.
*   **`setReputationCalculationFactor(uint256 factorType, uint256 newValue)`**: *Internal/Governance-only* function to adjust specific, granular factors within the reputation calculation formula, typically called via `executeProposal`.
*   **`setResourceCreditEmissionRate(uint256 newRate)`**: *Internal/Governance-only* function to adjust the overall emission rate of Resource Credits, typically called via `executeProposal`.

**V. Challenge & Dispute Resolution System**
*   **`initiateReputationChallenge(address targetUser, string calldata reason, uint256 stakedCredits)`**: Allows a user to challenge another user's reputation, requiring a stake of Resource Credits. The target's reputation is frozen during the challenge.
*   **`voteOnChallenge(uint256 challengeId, bool truthfulness)`**: Users vote on the veracity of a challenge, with voting power weighted by their current reputation score.
*   **`resolveChallenge(uint256 challengeId)`**: Finalizes a challenge after its voting period, applying reputation adjustments and distributing staked credits based on the voting outcome.

**VI. Protocol Administration & Utilities**
*   **`pauseProtocol()`**: An emergency function to temporarily halt critical protocol operations, callable only by the contract owner.
*   **`unpauseProtocol()`**: Resumes protocol operations after a pause, callable only by the contract owner.
*   **`withdrawStakedFunds(uint256 stakeId, address recipient)`**: Allows users to withdraw funds associated with a successfully unstaked or resolved stake, if not automatically distributed.
