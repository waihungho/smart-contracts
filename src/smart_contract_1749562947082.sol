Okay, let's create a smart contract that acts as a "Quantum Entanglement Vault". The core concept is a vault holding assets (ETH and ERC-20s) that can be released to multiple beneficiaries based on complex, multi-party, and potentially time-dependent conditions, mimicking (metaphorically) how observing one part of an entangled system instantly affects the state of the other.

The "entanglement" aspect will come from *Compound Conditions*, where the fulfillment of one release condition is dependent on the state or fulfillment of other distinct conditions, potentially involving different parties or time locks. We'll also include multi-party control over certain vault states (like triggering a "Frozen" or "Emergency" state).

This contract will *not* use Chainlink VRF for randomness (common), ERC721/ERC1155 standards directly (common), advanced yield farming/lending logic (common DeFi), or standard proxy upgrade patterns (common OpenZeppelin). Instead, it focuses on intricate conditional release logic, multi-party state control, and a custom condition dependency system.

**QuantumEntanglementVault Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Management:** Defines the lifecycle of the vault (Setup, Active, Frozen, Emergency, Collapsed).
2.  **Party Management:** Tracks owner, supervisors, and beneficiaries.
3.  **Condition Definition:** Allows defining different types of conditions (Time-Based, Approval-Based, Compound).
4.  **Release Configuration:** Links defined conditions to specific beneficiaries and asset amounts.
5.  **Deposit:** Accepts ETH and ERC-20 tokens into the vault.
6.  **Condition Processing:** Function to check if conditions are met and make assets claimable.
7.  **Claiming:** Allows beneficiaries to claim assets that have become claimable.
8.  **State Transitions:** Functions for changing the vault's state (e.g., Freeze, Emergency) based on specific triggers (multi-party approval for emergency).
9.  **Emergency Handling:** Special claim logic available only in the Emergency state.
10. **View Functions:** Provide transparency on vault state, balances, conditions, and claimable amounts.

**Function Summary (Minimum 20 functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with an owner.
2.  `setupVault()`: Finalizes setup after configuration, transitions state to `Active`.
3.  `addSupervisor(address supervisor)`: Adds an address as a supervisor (Owner only, Setup state).
4.  `removeSupervisor(address supervisor)`: Removes a supervisor (Owner only, Setup state).
5.  `addBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`: Adds an address as a beneficiary (Owner only, Setup state).
6.  `removeBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`: Removes a beneficiary (Owner only, Setup state).
7.  `defineTimeCondition(uint256 conditionId, uint64 releaseTimestamp)`: Defines a condition met after a specific timestamp (Owner only, Setup state).
8.  `defineApprovalCondition(uint256 conditionId, address[] requiredApprovers, uint256 requiredApprovalCount)`: Defines a condition requiring approval from a subset of specified parties (Owner only, Setup state).
9.  `defineCompoundCondition(uint256 conditionId, uint256[] childConditionIds)`: Defines a condition met only when ALL specified child conditions are met (Owner only, Setup state). *Entanglement concept.*
10. `configureRelease(uint256 conditionId, address beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, bool isEmergencyClaimable)`: Links a condition to a specific asset release for a beneficiary (Owner only, Setup state). `tokenAddress` 0x0 is for ETH.
11. `depositETH()`: Receives ETH into the vault (Payable, Active state).
12. `depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Receives ERC-20 tokens into the vault (Active state, requires prior `approve`).
13. `submitApproval(uint256 conditionId)`: Allows a required approver to approve an `ApprovalBased` condition (Callable by required approvers, Active state).
14. `checkAndProcessCondition(uint256 conditionId)`: Public function to evaluate a condition. If met and not processed, it updates state and makes corresponding releases claimable (Anyone can call, Active/Frozen state).
15. `claimAssets()`: Allows a beneficiary to claim all their currently claimable ETH and ERC-20 tokens (Callable by beneficiaries, Active/Frozen state).
16. `triggerFreeze()`: Allows a Supervisor to propose freezing the vault state (Supervisor only, Active state). Requires multi-sig confirmation (let's use a simple mechanism: owner or 50%+1 supervisors).
17. `resolveFreeze()`: Allows Owner or majority Supervisors to unfreeze the vault (Owner/Majority Supervisors only, Frozen state).
18. `triggerEmergency()`: Initiates the Emergency state transition process (Owner or Supervisor, Active/Frozen state). Requires multi-sig like confirmation.
19. `submitEmergencyVote()`: Allows a Supervisor to vote for entering Emergency state.
20. `emergencyClaim()`: Allows beneficiaries to claim assets marked as `isEmergencyClaimable`, regardless of normal conditions (Callable by beneficiaries, Emergency state).
21. `getVaultState()`: View function to get the current state.
22. `getVaultETHBalance()`: View function to get the contract's ETH balance.
23. `getVaultERC20Balance(address tokenAddress)`: View function to get the contract's balance of a specific ERC-20.
24. `getSupervisors()`: View function to get the list of supervisors.
25. `getBeneficiaries()`: View function to get the list of beneficiaries.
26. `getConditionDetails(uint256 conditionId)`: View function to get details of a specific condition.
27. `getConditionStatus(uint256 conditionId)`: View function to check if a condition is met and processed.
28. `getClaimableAmount(address beneficiary, address tokenAddress)`: View function to see how much of a specific token/ETH is claimable by a beneficiary.
29. `getReleaseConfigsForBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`: View function to list all release configurations for a beneficiary.
30. `collapseVault()`: Allows owner to collapse the vault (Owner only, Active/Frozen state, potentially after all conditions met or after a long time). Transfers remaining assets based on pre-defined rules (for simplicity, let's say sends remaining back to deployer/owner).
