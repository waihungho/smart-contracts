Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept I've designed called "NarrativeNexus". It focuses on creating, staking on, and resolving "narratives" (propositions or predictions) on-chain, incorporating concepts like dynamic credibility scores, a simple reputation system, and a structured resolution process, aiming for creativity and multiple functions without directly cloning common open-source patterns like standard ERC20/721 contracts, basic staking, or fixed-price mints.

---

**Contract Name:** `NarrativeNexus`

**Description:** A decentralized platform for proposing and engaging with 'narratives' â€“ speculative or factual propositions about future events or states. Users can stake tokens to support or oppose a narrative's predicted outcome. The contract facilitates resolution (potentially via oracle or time) and rewards successful predictors while penalizing unsuccessful ones, contributing to a dynamic "credibility score" for each narrative and a simple on-chain "reputation" for users.

**Core Concepts:**
1.  **Narratives:** On-chain representations of testable propositions.
2.  **Staking:** Users lock tokens to signal their belief in a narrative's outcome (For or Against).
3.  **Resolution:** A defined process (oracle-driven or time-based) to determine the objective outcome of a narrative.
4.  **Dynamic Credibility:** A score for each narrative, influenced by how well the collective staking predicted the actual outcome.
5.  **User Reputation:** A simple score reflecting a user's history of successful predictions/stakes.
6.  **Structured Workflow:** Narratives progress through distinct states (Open, ResolutionRequested, Resolved, Canceled).
7.  **Fee Mechanism:** A small percentage of losing stakes is taken as a protocol fee before distribution to winners.

**State Variables Summary:**
*   `owner`: The contract owner (basic admin).
*   `paused`: Boolean to pause core functions.
*   `stakingToken`: Address of the ERC20 token used for staking.
*   `narratives`: Mapping from unique ID to `Narrative` struct.
*   `narrativeCount`: Counter for generating unique narrative IDs.
*   `userReputation`: Mapping from user address to reputation score.
*   `narrativeStakeFor`: Mapping `narrativeId => user => amount` staked 'For'.
*   `narrativeStakeAgainst`: Mapping `narrativeId => user => amount` staked 'Against'.
*   `totalNarrativeStakeFor`: Mapping `narrativeId => total amount` staked 'For'.
*   `totalNarrativeStakeAgainst`: Mapping `narrativeId => total amount` staked 'Against'.
*   `narrativeOutcome`: Mapping `narrativeId => resolved outcome (bool?)`.
*   `claimsProcessed`: Mapping `narrativeId => user => bool` (has claimed?).
*   `protocolFeesCollected`: Total fees accumulated.
*   `feePercentageBasisPoints`: Fee percentage * 100 (e.g., 500 for 5%).
*   `currentParams`: Struct holding adjustable parameters (min stake, max stake, resolution period).
*   `proposedParams`: Struct holding proposed parameters (for owner acceptance).

**Enums & Structs Summary:**
*   `ResolutionMethod`: Enum { ORACLE, TIMESTAMP } - How a narrative is resolved.
*   `NarrativeStatus`: Enum { OPEN, RESOLUTION_REQUESTED, RESOLVED, CANCELED } - Current state of a narrative.
*   `Narrative`: Struct holding narrative details (proposer, details, status, method, time, oracle query ID, etc.).
*   `ContractParams`: Struct holding adjustable contract parameters.

**Events Summary:**
*   `NarrativeProposed`: Logs when a narrative is created.
*   `StakedFor`: Logs a 'For' stake.
*   `StakedAgainst`: Logs an 'Against' stake.
*   `Unstaked`: Logs a stake withdrawal (before resolution).
*   `EvidenceAdded`: Logs when evidence hash is added.
*   `ResolutionRequested`: Logs when resolution process starts.
*   `OracleResultSubmitted`: Logs when an oracle result is received.
*   `NarrativeResolved`: Logs when a narrative is finalized.
*   `WinningsClaimed`: Logs when a user claims winnings.
*   `NarrativeCanceled`: Logs when a narrative is canceled.
*   `FeePercentageUpdated`: Logs change in fee.
*   `FeesWithdrawn`: Logs withdrawal of fees by owner.
*   `Paused`, `Unpaused`: System pause state changes.
*   `ParamsProposed`, `ParamsAccepted`: Governance/parameter update events.

**Function Summary (>= 20):**

**Setup & Administration:**
1.  `constructor(address _stakingToken)`: Initializes the contract with the staking token address.
2.  `setFeePercentage(uint256 _feeBasisPoints)`: Owner sets the fee percentage on losing stakes.
3.  `withdrawFees()`: Owner withdraws accumulated protocol fees.
4.  `pauseSystem()`: Owner pauses core staking/resolution functions.
5.  `unpauseSystem()`: Owner unpauses the system.
6.  `proposeParamUpdate(uint256 _minStake, uint256 _maxStake, uint256 _resolutionPeriod)`: Owner proposes new contract parameters.
7.  `acceptParamUpdate()`: Owner accepts the proposed parameters.

**Narrative Management:**
8.  `proposeNarrative(string memory _details, ResolutionMethod _method, uint256 _resolutionTime, bytes32 _oracleQueryId)`: Creates a new narrative with details, resolution method, time (if applicable), and oracle ID (if applicable). Requires minimum stake from proposer.
9.  `addEvidence(uint256 _narrativeId, string memory _evidenceHash)`: Adds a hash (pointer to off-chain evidence) to a narrative.
10. `cancelNarrative(uint256 _narrativeId, string memory _reason)`: Owner or proposer can cancel a narrative if no staking has occurred or with governance approval (simplified to owner for this example).
11. `withdrawCanceledStake(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Users reclaim stakes from a canceled narrative.

**Staking:**
12. `stakeFor(uint256 _narrativeId, uint256 _amount)`: Stakes tokens in support of a narrative's outcome.
13. `stakeAgainst(uint256 _narrativeId, uint256 _amount)`: Stakes tokens in opposition to a narrative's outcome.
14. `unstake(uint256 _narrativeId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to withdraw a portion of their stake *before* resolution is requested.

**Resolution & Claims:**
15. `requestResolution(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Initiates the resolution process for a narrative (callable by anyone after resolution time or meeting oracle conditions). Changes status to `RESOLUTION_REQUESTED`.
16. `submitOracleResult(uint256 _narrativeId, bytes32 _oracleQueryId, bool _outcome)`: Designated oracle address submits the outcome for ORACLE-based narratives.
17. `resolveNarrative(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Finalizes the narrative resolution. Calculates winnings based on the outcome and staked amounts. Updates user reputation. Transitions status to `RESOLVED`. Callable after `RESOLUTION_REQUESTED` and time/oracle conditions met.
18. `claimWinnings(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Users claim their share of the winning pool after a narrative is resolved.

**Queries & Views:**
19. `getNarrative(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns the struct containing details of a specific narrative.
20. `getNarrativeState(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns dynamic state like total staked 'For' and 'Against'.
21. `getUserStake(uint256 _narrativeId, address _user)`: Returns the amount a specific user staked 'For' and 'Against' on a narrative.
22. `getNarrativeEvidence(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns the list of evidence hashes for a narrative.
23. `getNarrativeResolutionParams(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns the resolution method, time, and oracle ID.
24. `getNarrativeStatus(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns the current status of a narrative.
25. `checkResolutionOutcome(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Returns the resolved outcome (if resolved).
26. `calculateNarrativeCredibility(uint256 _narrativeId)`: Calculates a score based on the narrative's resolution outcome vs. the initial staking ratio. Returns 0 if not resolved.
27. `getUserReputation(address _user)`: Returns the reputation score of a user.
28. `getContractBalance()`: Returns the balance of the staking token held by the contract.
29. `getCurrentParams()`: Returns the currently active contract parameters.
30. `getProposedParams()`: Returns the parameters currently proposed but not yet accepted.

This structure provides a complete lifecycle for narratives, involves user interaction through staking and claims, uses a structured resolution process, and adds layers like reputation and dynamic credibility scores.
