 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery.
 *      This gallery allows artists to submit their digital art (NFTs),
 *      community members to curate and vote on artworks for exhibitions,
 *      and implements advanced features like fractional ownership, dynamic pricing,
 *      art staking, and decentralized royalties.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **Gallery Management:**
 * 1. `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _curator)`: Initializes the gallery with a name and initial curator.
 * 2. `setGalleryName(string _newName)`: Allows the gallery owner to change the gallery name.
 * 3. `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Allows the gallery owner to transfer ownership to a new address.
 * 4. `addCurator(address _newCurator)`: Allows the gallery owner to add a new curator.
 * 5. `removeCurator(address _curatorToRemove)`: Allows the gallery owner to remove a curator.
 * 6. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows the gallery owner to set the platform fee percentage.
 * 7. `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *
 * **Artist and Artwork Management:**
 * 8. `artistRegistration(string _artistName)`: Allows artists to register with the gallery.
 * 9. `submitArtwork(string _artworkURI, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows registered artists to submit artwork NFTs for consideration.
 * 10. `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to approve submitted artworks for exhibition.
 * 11. `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to reject submitted artworks.
 * 12. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Allows approved artists to list their artworks for sale.
 * 13. `removeArtworkFromSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artists to remove their listed artworks from sale.
 * 14. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artworks listed for sale.
 * 15. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows artists to change the price of their listed artworks.
 *
 * **Advanced Features:**
 * 16. `fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionCount)`: Allows artists to fractionalize their approved artworks.
 * 17. `buyFractionalShares(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _shareCount)`: Allows users to buy fractional shares of an artwork.
 * 18. `stakeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artwork owners to stake their artworks to earn rewards (example reward mechanism).
 * 19. `unstakeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artwork owners to unstake their artworks.
 * 20. `voteForExhibition(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows community members to vote for artworks to be featured in upcoming exhibitions (basic voting).
 * 21. `collectRoyalties(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artists to collect royalties earned from secondary sales (simulated royalty mechanism).
 * 22. `donateToGallery()`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the gallery treasury.
