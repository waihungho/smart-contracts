 * @title Adaptive Governance DAO - Smart Contract Outline and Function Summary
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev This smart contract implements an advanced Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with adaptive governance,
 * reputation-based influence, dynamic voting mechanisms, and features for community engagement and resilience.
 * It aims to be a creative and trendy example, avoiding direct duplication of existing open-source DAO frameworks
 * while incorporating best practices and advanced concepts in smart contract development.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **Initialization and Configuration:**
 *     - `initializeDAO`:  Initializes the DAO with core parameters and owner.
 *     - `setVotingDuration`:  Dynamically sets the default voting duration for proposals.
 *     - `setQuorumThreshold`:  Dynamically sets the quorum threshold for proposal approval.
 *     - `setProposalDeposit`:  Sets the deposit required to submit a proposal.
 *
 * 2.  **Membership and Reputation System:**
 *     - `addMember`:  Adds a new member to the DAO (permissioned or permissionless based on initial setup).
 *     - `removeMember`:  Removes a member from the DAO (governance-driven).
 *     - `updateMemberReputation`:  Updates a member's reputation score based on contributions/behavior.
 *     - `getMemberReputation`:  Retrieves a member's current reputation score.
 *
 * 3.  **Proposal Management:**
 *     - `submitProposal`:  Members can submit proposals with detailed descriptions and actions.
 *     - `cancelProposal`:  Proposal submitter can cancel a proposal before voting starts (with conditions).
 *     - `getProposalState`:  Retrieves the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Passed, Rejected, Executed, Cancelled).
 *     - `getProposalDetails`:  Retrieves detailed information about a specific proposal.
 *     - `queueProposalExecution`:  Queues a passed proposal for execution after a timelock.
 *
 * 4.  **Voting and Governance:**
 *     - `castVote`:  Members cast their votes (For, Against, Abstain) on active proposals.
 *     - `delegateVote`:  Members can delegate their voting power to another member.
 *     - `revokeVoteDelegation`:  Members can revoke their vote delegation.
 *     - `getProposalVotes`:  Retrieves the vote counts (For, Against, Abstain) for a proposal.
 *     - `executeProposal`:  Executes a passed proposal after timelock and quorum is met.
 *     - `emergencyHaltGovernance`:  Emergency function to temporarily halt all governance actions (owner-controlled for critical situations).
 *     - `resumeGovernance`:  Resumes normal governance operations after emergency halt (owner-controlled).
 *
 * 5.  **Treasury and Financial Management:**
 *     - `depositFunds`:  Allows depositing ETH or other ERC20 tokens into the DAO treasury.
 *     - `requestTreasuryWithdrawal`:  Members can propose treasury withdrawals for approved purposes.
 *     - `getTreasuryBalance`:  Retrieves the current balance of the DAO treasury (ETH and specific ERC20 tokens).
 *
 * 6.  **Adaptive and Advanced Features:**
 *     - `adjustQuorumBasedOnParticipation`:  Dynamically adjusts quorum based on recent voter participation rates (adaptive governance).
 *     - `enforceReputationWeightedVoting`:  Optionally enables reputation-weighted voting where vote power is influenced by reputation.
 *     - `setGovernanceModule`:  Allows setting or upgrading a modular governance component (placeholder for future extensibility).
 *     - `signalCommunitySentiment`: Members can signal general sentiment (positive/negative) on non-proposal related topics, providing continuous community feedback.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Initialization & Configuration:**
 * - `initializeDAO(address _owner, uint256 _initialVotingDuration, uint256 _initialQuorumThreshold, uint256 _proposalDeposit)`: Initializes the DAO with owner, voting duration, quorum, and proposal deposit.
 * - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _votingDuration)`: Sets the default voting duration for proposals (governance-controlled).
 * - `setQuorumThreshold(uint256 _quorumThreshold)`: Sets the quorum threshold for proposal approval (governance-controlled).
 * - `setProposalDeposit(uint256 _proposalDeposit)`: Sets the deposit required to submit a proposal (governance-controlled).
 *
 * **Membership & Reputation:**
 * - `addMember(address _member)`: Adds a new member to the DAO (permissioned or permissionless based on initial setup, can be governance-controlled).
 * - `removeMember(address _member)`: Removes a member from the DAO (governance-controlled).
 * - `updateMemberReputation(address _member, int256 _reputationChange)`: Updates a member's reputation score (governance-controlled or role-based).
 * - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves a member's reputation score.
 *
 * **Proposal Management:**
 * - `submitProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes memory _actions)`: Submits a new proposal with title, description, and encoded actions.
 * - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Cancels a submitted proposal before voting starts (proposer-controlled with conditions).
 * - `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the state of a proposal.
 * - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a proposal.
 * - `queueProposalExecution(uint256 _proposalId)`: Queues a passed proposal for execution after a timelock (governance-controlled).
 *
 * **Voting & Governance:**
 * - `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _voteOption)`: Casts a vote on a proposal.
 * - `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Delegates voting power to another member.
 * - `revokeVoteDelegation()`: Revokes vote delegation.
 * - `getProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves vote counts for a proposal.
 * - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed and queued proposal.
 * - `emergencyHaltGovernance()`: Halts governance actions in emergencies (owner-controlled).
 * - `resumeGovernance()`: Resumes governance actions after emergency halt (owner-controlled).
 *
 * **Treasury & Financial Management:**
 * - `depositFunds()` payable: Deposits ETH into the DAO treasury.
 * - `requestTreasuryWithdrawal(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Proposes a treasury withdrawal.
 * - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Retrieves the DAO treasury balance (ETH and potentially ERC20 tokens - not fully implemented in this basic example).
 *
 * **Adaptive & Advanced Features:**

**Important Considerations and Disclaimer:**

*   **Security Audit:** This code is for illustrative and educational purposes only and has not been audited for security vulnerabilities. **Do not use this code in a production environment without a thorough security audit.** DAOs manage valuable assets and require robust security.
*   **Simplified Features:** Some features are simplified placeholders (e.g., `_actions` in proposals, treasury management, adaptive quorum logic, reputation-weighted voting, governance module). A real-world DAO would require much more complex implementations of these features.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The code is not optimized for gas efficiency. Gas costs should be carefully considered and optimized for production deployments.
*   **Error Handling and Edge Cases:** While basic `require` statements are used, more comprehensive error handling and handling of edge cases would be necessary for a production-ready contract.
*   **Access Control:** Access control is simplified using `onlyOwner` and `onlyMember` modifiers. A real-world DAO might need more granular role-based access control and permission management.
*   **Upgradeability:** This contract is not designed to be upgradeable. For a long-lived DAO, consider implementing upgradeability patterns (using proxies, etc.).
*   **Off-Chain Infrastructure:**  A fully functional DAO typically requires off-chain infrastructure for proposal creation interfaces, voting UIs, execution mechanisms, and monitoring. This contract only covers the on-chain logic.
*   **Token Integration:** This example DAO does not explicitly integrate with a token for governance rights. In many DAOs, governance is tied to holding a specific token.
*   **Community Input:**  Building a successful DAO requires strong community involvement and governance processes. This smart contract is just a technical foundation.

This comprehensive example provides a starting point for exploring advanced DAO concepts in Solidity. Remember to thoroughly research, test, and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a live blockchain.
