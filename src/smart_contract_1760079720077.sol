Here's a Solidity smart contract for a "Chronos Collective," designed to be an advanced, dynamic autonomous organization. It features adaptive governance, a reputation system with lazy decay, dynamic member influence, and decentralized project management, all without directly duplicating existing open-source contracts like standard DAOs (Compound, Aave governance) by combining and evolving these concepts with unique adaptive mechanisms.

---

### **Chronos Collective: Dynamic Autonomous Organization**

This smart contract implements a Dynamic Autonomous Collective (DAC) designed for advanced decentralized governance, adaptive resource management, and a sophisticated reputation-based influence system. It aims to create a self-evolving organization where member influence, governance parameters, and collective decisions adapt over time based on on-chain activity, reputation, and potentially external market conditions.

---

**I. Core Management & Initialization**

1.  `constructor(address _governanceToken, uint256 _initialMinStake, uint256 _initialBaseQuorumNumerator, uint256 _initialVotingDuration, uint256 _reputationDecayPeriod, uint256 _reputationDecayFactor, address _oracleAddress)`
    *   Initializes the contract with the governance token, minimum stake for joining, base quorum, voting duration, reputation decay parameters, and an optional oracle address. Sets the deployer as the initial owner.
2.  `updateGovernanceToken(address _newTokenAddress)`: (Owner only)
    *   Allows the owner to update the ERC20 token used for staking and governance influence.
3.  `setOracleAddress(address _newOracleAddress)`: (Owner only)
    *   Sets or updates the address of the external oracle used for adaptive governance parameters.
4.  `pause()`: (Owner only, Emergency)
    *   Pauses the contract, halting sensitive operations like staking, unstaking, and proposal actions.
5.  `unpause()`: (Owner only)
    *   Unpauses the contract, restoring full functionality.

**II. Membership & Dynamic Influence**

6.  `joinCollective()`:
    *   Allows a new user to join the collective by staking the `minStake` amount of governance tokens. Initializes their reputation score and sets their last active timestamp.
7.  `leaveCollective()`:
    *   Allows an existing member to leave the collective. Initiates an unstaking cooldown period for their staked tokens and reduces their reputation.
8.  `getMemberInfluence(address _member)`: `view returns (uint256)`
    *   Calculates a member's current dynamic influence score, factoring in staked tokens, reputation score (lazily decayed), and recent activity. This score determines voting power.
9.  `getReputationScore(address _member)`: `view returns (uint256)`
    *   Returns the current (lazily decayed) reputation score of a member.
10. `getMemberStake(address _member)`: `view returns (uint256)`
    *   Returns the amount of governance tokens currently staked by a member.

**III. Staking & Treasury Management**

11. `stakeFunds(uint256 _amount)`:
    *   Allows a member to stake additional governance tokens, increasing their influence.
12. `requestUnstake(uint256 _amount)`:
    *   Initiates an unstaking request for a specified amount. The funds become available after a defined cooldown period.
13. `claimUnstakedFunds()`:
    *   Allows a member to claim their unstaked tokens after the cooldown period has elapsed.
14. `depositToTreasury(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:
    *   Allows any user to deposit any ERC20 token into the collective's treasury.
15. `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal(address _recipient, address _token, uint256 _amount, string memory _description)`:
    *   Submits a governance proposal to withdraw a specific amount of a token from the treasury to a recipient.

**IV. Adaptive Governance & Proposals**

16. `submitProposal(bytes memory _calldata, string memory _description)`:
    *   Allows members with sufficient influence to submit a general governance proposal. `_calldata` contains the encoded function call to be executed if the proposal passes.
17. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`:
    *   Allows members to cast a vote (for or against) on an active proposal, with their vote weight determined by `getMemberInfluence()`.
18. `finalizeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:
    *   Closes a proposal. If it passes the dynamic quorum and majority, the associated `_calldata` is executed. Adjusts reputation based on voting outcomes.
19. `getDynamicQuorum()`: `view returns (uint256)`
    *   Calculates the current required quorum for proposals, adapting based on active members, average collective reputation, and oracle data (if available).
20. `getDynamicVotingDuration()`: `view returns (uint256)`
    *   Calculates the current voting duration for new proposals, adapting based on collective state and oracle data.

**V. Project & Task Management (Decentralized & Reputation-Based)**

21. `proposeNewProject(string memory _projectName, string memory _description, uint256 _fundingGoal, uint256 _deadline)`:
    *   A member proposes a new project requiring collective funding and approval.
22. `contributeToProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)`:
    *   Allows members to contribute funds (governance token or other ERC20) towards a proposed project's funding goal.
23. `assignProjectLead(uint256 _projectId, address _leadAddress)`: (Governance proposal or high reputation members only)
    *   Assigns a project lead to an approved and funded project. Project lead receives reputation boost.
24. `submitProjectDeliverable(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId, string memory _deliverableHash)`: (Project Lead only)
    *   The project lead submits a hash representing a completed milestone deliverable.
25. `verifyProjectDeliverable(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId, bool _isVerified)`: (Designated verifiers or governance)
    *   Allows designated verifiers or the collective through a mini-governance vote to verify if a milestone deliverable is satisfactory. Successful verification rewards the project lead's reputation.
26. `distributeProjectRewards(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId)`: (Owner or authorized)
    *   Distributes a portion of the project's funding as rewards to the project lead and contributors upon successful verification of a milestone.
