Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's design a smart contract for a "QuantumLeap DAO" that integrates several advanced, trendy, and creative concepts without directly duplicating common open-source implementations. The focus will be on adaptive governance, privacy-preserving actions, and a dynamic reputation system.

---

## QuantumLeap DAO Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Introduction:** A decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding and governing innovative projects, adapting its rules based on external "AI-driven insights" and allowing for privacy-preserving actions via ZK proofs.
2.  **Core Components:**
    *   **QLT (QuantumLeap Token):** The governance token, but with an enhanced delegation mechanism that considers reputation.
    *   **AI Oracle Integration:** Allows an external, trusted AI oracle to influence governance parameters (e.g., quorum, voting thresholds) based on real-world data or simulated "market sentiment."
    *   **ZK Proofs for Private Actions:** Enables certain sensitive proposals or funding requests to be initiated or voted upon with privacy, with an on-chain verifier checking off-chain Zero-Knowledge proofs.
    *   **Dynamic Reputation System:** Rewards active participation, successful proposals, and positive contributions, influencing voting power and access to specific grants.
    *   **Adaptive Governance:** Parameters like proposal delays, voting periods, and execution delays can dynamically adjust, potentially influenced by AI insights.
    *   **Blind/Revealed Proposals:** A mechanism for sensitive proposals to be submitted as a hash (blindly) and then revealed after a preliminary vote or specific conditions are met.
    *   **Staking & Incentives:** Encourages long-term commitment and participation.
    *   **Treasury Management:** Secure funding and disbursement mechanisms.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

**I. Core DAO Governance (QLT Token & Proposals)**
1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the DAO, deploys QLT, sets initial parameters.
2.  `delegate(address delegatee)`: Delegates QLT token voting power, considering reputation score.
3.  `getVotes(address account)`: Returns the total voting power for an account (QLT + reputation influence).
4.  `propose(bytes32 proposalHash, string calldata descriptionURI)`: Creates a new proposal based on a content hash and a URI for off-chain details.
5.  `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Casts a vote (support/against) on a proposal.
6.  `queueProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Moves a successful proposal to the execution queue.
7.  `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a queued proposal.
8.  `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancels a proposal, typically by an emergency multisig or if it fails to pass.
9.  `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal.

**II. AI Oracle Integration & Dynamic Parameters**
10. `setAIOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Sets the address of the trusted AI Oracle contract. (Only callable by owner/governance).
11. `updateAIGovernanceMetric(uint256 _metricValue)`: Oracle-only function to update an AI-derived governance metric.
12. `getAIGovernanceMetric()`: Retrieves the current AI-derived governance metric.
13. `adjustVotingThresholdsByAI(uint256 newThresholdMultiplier)`: Allows the DAO or AI Oracle to dynamically adjust voting thresholds.
14. `adjustQuorumByAI(uint256 newQuorumPercentage)`: Allows the DAO or AI Oracle to dynamically adjust the quorum requirements.

**III. ZK Proofs for Privacy-Preserving Actions**
15. `setZKVerifierAddress(address _verifier)`: Sets the address of the trusted ZK Proof Verifier contract.
16. `submitZKProofForPrivateVote(uint256 proposalId, bytes calldata _proof, bytes32 _publicInputsHash)`: Submits a ZK proof to cast a private, verifiable vote on a sensitive proposal.
17. `processZKVerifiedAction(uint256 actionType, bytes calldata _proof, bytes32 _publicInputsHash, bytes calldata _actionData)`: Initiates an action (e.g., claiming a private grant) that requires a valid ZK proof.

**IV. Dynamic Reputation System**
18. `updateReputation(address target, uint256 amount, bool increase)`: Internal function to adjust a user's reputation score based on actions (e.g., successful proposal, active voting).
19. `delegateReputation(address delegatee)`: Delegates an account's reputation score to another account.
20. `getReputation(address account)`: Returns the current reputation score for an account.
21. `issueReputationBasedGrant(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Issues a grant where eligibility or amount is influenced by the recipient's reputation score.

**V. Blind/Revealed Proposals (for Sensitive Information)**
22. `submitBlindProposalHash(bytes32 _blindHash, string calldata _descriptionURI)`: Submits a proposal where the content is initially hidden as a hash.
23. `revealBlindProposal(uint256 proposalId, string calldata _actualContentURI)`: Reveals the actual content of a blind proposal after it passes an initial voting phase or condition.

**VI. Treasury & Emergency Management**
24. `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
25. `withdrawFundsByProposal(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows funds to be withdrawn only after a successful proposal execution.
26. `emergencyPause()`: Allows a designated emergency multi-sig to pause critical DAO functions.
27. `emergencyUnpause()`: Unpauses the DAO functions.
