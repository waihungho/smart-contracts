This smart contract, "CogniLatticeProtocol," is designed as an advanced, creative, and unique platform for collective intelligence and emergent digital asset generation. It focuses on the idea of an on-chain "cognitive network" where users contribute, synthesize, and collectively curate abstract ideas, leading to the creation of concrete digital assets and adaptive protocol governance.

---

## CogniLatticeProtocol: Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** CogniLatticeProtocol

**Core Idea:** An innovative protocol enabling the decentralized generation, synthesis, and evaluation of "ThoughtFragments," culminating in the emergence of new digital assets ("EmergentConstructs") and adaptive protocol governance. Users contribute, combine, and collectively curate ideas, driving an on-chain "collective intelligence."

**Advanced Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Multi-tier Dynamic NFTs:**
    *   **ThoughtFragments (ERC721):** Represent raw, foundational ideas.
    *   **SynthesizedThoughts (ERC721):** More complex ideas derived from combining ThoughtFragments. They have a lineage and evolve in "coherence."
    *   **EmergentConstructs (ERC721):** Concrete digital assets or applications that "emerge" from highly coherent SynthesizedThoughts.
2.  **On-chain Synthesis Logic:** Users combine fragments by providing an off-chain derived "synthesis hash" (representing a proof or unique derivation logic), which is recorded on-chain. This hash is crucial for unique identification and potential future verification.
3.  **Coherence Engine (Staking & Curation):** A core mechanism where participants stake a hypothetical protocol token (`ISynToken`) to collectively endorse or "boost" the "coherence" score of SynthesizedThoughts. This score is dynamic and determines the thought's potential for "emergence."
4.  **Emergent Asset Generation:** SynthesizedThoughts that achieve a high coherence threshold can be "catalyzed" into `EmergentConstruct` NFTs, symbolizing the materialization of a collective idea into a tangible digital asset.
5.  **Adaptive Protocol Governance:** Highly coherent SynthesizedThoughts can directly propose and influence changes to the protocol's parameters (e.g., minimum coherence for emergence, fee rates), making the system self-modifying based on its collective intelligence. This goes beyond simple voting by linking governance directly to the "validity" of an emergent idea.
6.  **Reputation System:** Meaningful participation (successful synthesis, accurate coherence staking, impactful proposals) contributes to a user's on-chain reputation, granting them higher influence.
7.  **Economic Incentives:** Rewards are distributed to creators and coherence stakers of successfully emergent ideas from a protocol fee pool.

7.  `finalizeSynthesis(uint256 _pendingSynthesizedId, bytes32 _synthesisHash)`: Completes the synthesis process, requiring a unique `_synthesisHash` (e.g., derived from an off-chain computation/proof) and mints the SynthesizedThought NFT.
8.  `getSynthesizedThoughtDetails(uint256 _tokenId) returns (address creator, uint256[] memory parentFragments, string memory uri, uint256 coherenceScore, uint256 timestamp)`: Retrieves comprehensive details of a SynthesizedThought, including its current coherence score.

10. `burnSynthesizedThought(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the creator to burn their SynthesizedThought (e.g., if it's flawed, before it gains significant coherence or emerges).

**III. Coherence Engine & Staking**

11. `stakeForCoherence(uint256 _synthesizedThoughtId, uint256 _amount)`: Users stake `ISynToken` to endorse a SynthesizedThought, which boosts its coherence score.
12. `unstakeFromCoherence(uint256 _synthesizedThoughtId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to remove their staked `ISynToken` from a SynthesizedThought.
13. `getSynthesizedThoughtCoherenceScore(uint256 _synthesizedThoughtId) returns (uint256)`: Returns the current collective coherence score for a specific SynthesizedThought.

16. `claimStakingRewards()`: Allows stakers to withdraw their accrued `ISynToken` rewards.

**IV. Emergence & Cognitive Constructs (ERC721-like)**

17. `catalyzeEmergence(uint256 _synthesizedThoughtId, string memory _constructUri)`: If a SynthesizedThought has achieved sufficient coherence, this function mints a new "EmergentConstruct" NFT, representing a concrete outcome or application of the idea. Requires an `ISynToken` fee.

22. `voteOnAdaptationProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Participants vote on proposed protocol adaptations (vote weight can be based on reputation or staked tokens).
23. `executeAdaptationProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a governance proposal if it has passed the voting threshold.
24. `setMinimumCoherenceForEmergence(uint256 _newMinCoherence)`: A governance function to adjust the minimum coherence score required for a SynthesizedThought to catalyze emergence.
25. `setMinimumReputationForProposal(uint256 _newMinReputation)`: A governance function to adjust the minimum reputation required to submit a protocol adaptation proposal.

**VI. Protocol Treasury & Control**

26. `setEmergenceFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Allows governance to set the `ISynToken` fee required to catalyze emergence.
27. `withdrawProtocolFees(address _to)`: Governance function to withdraw accumulated `ISynToken` fees to a specified address.
28. `pause()`: An emergency function to pause critical operations of the contract.
29. `unpause()`: An emergency function to unpause critical operations.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is a conceptual demonstration. It incorporates advanced ideas but simplifies their real-world implementation for brevity. A production-grade system would require extensive security audits, robust error handling, gas optimizations, and potentially off-chain components (e.g., for complex synthesis proof generation, IPFS for URI storage). The `ISynToken` interface assumes an existing ERC-20 token for staking and rewards.
