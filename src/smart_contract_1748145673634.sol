Okay, let's design an interesting, advanced, and non-standard smart contract.

**Concept:** A "Decentralized Outcome Prediction & Reputation Game" (let's call it PredictaRep). Users can create events with multiple outcomes, others can predict outcomes by staking Ether. Correct predictions earn rewards from the total stake pool (minus a small fee), and users build an on-chain reputation score based on their prediction accuracy. This reputation could potentially unlock future features (though we'll focus on the core mechanics and tracking reputation).

**Why it's potentially interesting/advanced/creative:**
1.  **Combined System:** Not just a prediction market, but integrates a persistent, dynamic reputation system.
2.  **Dynamic Reputation:** Reputation changes based on success/failure, potentially influencing future interactions or being used by other protocols.
3.  **Multi-Outcome Events:** Handles events with more than just two outcomes (like sports matches, election results with multiple candidates, etc.).
4.  **Self-Sufficiency:** Manages stakes, rewards, and fees internally.
5.  **Oracle Dependency (Simulated):** Requires external input for resolution, highlighting oracle integration needs (we'll use owner/trusted resolver for simplicity in the example, but the concept implies oracle use).
6.  **Complexity:** Manages multiple state variables per user, event, and prediction, along with calculations for payouts and reputation updates.

**Avoiding Duplicates:** While prediction markets exist, the tight coupling with a stake-weighted, persistent, on-chain reputation system in the same contract is less common than standard prediction market templates or simple betting contracts. The "game" aspect and the focus on the *user profile* and *reputation* as key elements differentiate it from purely financial prediction platforms. It's not a standard ERC-20, ERC-721, simple multi-sig, simple DAO, or basic staking contract.

## PredictaRep Smart Contract Outline

**Purpose:** A decentralized application allowing users to predict outcomes of defined events, stake cryptocurrency on their predictions, earn rewards for correct predictions, and build a persistent on-chain reputation based on their success rate.

**Core Components:**
1.  **Users:** Each user has a profile with balance, reputation score, and prediction history.
2.  **Events:** Defined by an owner/trusted entity, with a description, potential outcomes, deadlines for prediction and resolution.
3.  **Predictions:** Users stake funds on a specific outcome for an event before the deadline.
4.  **Resolution:** A trusted entity resolves the event by selecting the winning outcome.
5.  **Payouts:** Correct predictors share the total staked pot (minus fees) proportionally to their stake.
6.  **Reputation:** User reputation is updated based on prediction results.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: The contract owner.
*   `oracleAddress`: An address authorized to resolve events (could be owner or a dedicated oracle contract).
*   `feePercentage`: Percentage of winnings taken as a platform fee.
*   `minBetAmount`: Minimum amount required to make a prediction.
*   `eventCount`: Counter for unique event IDs.
*   `events`: Mapping of event ID to Event struct.
*   `userProfiles`: Mapping of user address to UserProfile struct.
*   `eventPredictions`: Mapping of event ID to user address to Prediction struct.
*   `activeEventIds`: Array of IDs of events open for prediction or awaiting resolution.
*   `resolvedEventIds`: Array of IDs of resolved events.
*   `canceledEventIds`: Array of IDs of canceled events.

**Structs:**
*   `UserProfile`: `uint256 balance`, `int256 reputation`, `uint256 totalPredictions`, `uint256 correctPredictions`.
*   `Event`: `uint256 eventId`, `string description`, `string[] outcomes`, `uint256 predictionDeadline`, `uint256 resolutionTime`, `int256 winningOutcomeIndex` (use -1 for unresolved, -2 for canceled), `uint256 totalPot`, `uint256 totalCorrectStake`, `bool isResolved`, `bool isCanceled`.
*   `Prediction`: `uint256 eventId`, `address predictor`, `uint256 outcomeIndex`, `uint256 stakeAmount`, `bool claimed`, `bool isCorrect`.

*   `_addResolvedEventId(uint256 _eventId)`: Adds an event ID to the resolved list.
*   `_addCanceledEventId(uint256 _eventId)`: Adds an event ID to the canceled list.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Integrated Reputation System:** The `UserProfile` struct and the `reputation` field, updated by `_updateReputation` and triggered in `claimWinnings`, is the central advanced concept here. It's not just financial betting; it's building a persistent on-chain identity score tied to prediction skill. While simple here (fixed points), it lays the groundwork for more complex reputation mechanics (stake-weighted reputation impact, time decay, quadratic reputation gain/loss, using reputation for tiered access/features).
2.  **Multi-Outcome Events:** The `string[] outcomes` and using `outcomeIndex` makes the contract flexible enough for various types of events beyond binary outcomes (e.g., "Team A wins", "Draw", "Team B wins" or election candidates A, B, C...).
3.  **Pull Payment for Winnings:** Using `claimWinnings` and updating user balances (`userProfiles[msg.sender].balance += winnings`) rather than directly sending Ether during `resolveEvent` is a standard and secure practice to prevent re-entrancy attacks and manage gas costs associated with iterating through many winners in a single transaction.
4.  **Separation of Concerns (Implicit Oracle):** While `resolveEvent` is callable by the owner or `oracleAddress`, the design pattern explicitly separates the *resolution* (setting the outcome) from the *payout* (claiming winnings), which is necessary when relying on external data (oracles) for resolution.
5.  **Dynamic Arrays for Event Tracking:** Using `activeEventIds`, `resolvedEventIds`, `canceledEventIds` provides dynamic lists of events in different states. *Self-correction:* Noted in comments, iteration and manipulation of these in Solidity is gas-intensive for large N. A more advanced implementation would use linked lists in storage or external indexing solutions for scalability, but for a demonstration, dynamic arrays suffice.
6.  **Basis Points for Fees:** Using basis points (1/100th of a percent) for fees (`feePercentage`) is a common and precise way to handle small percentages in Solidity.
7.  **Modern Solidity Features:** Uses `error` definitions (more gas-efficient than `require` with strings), `immutable` for owner (standard best practice), and `ReentrancyGuard` (standard security pattern).

**Limitations and Potential Improvements (for a real-world application):**

*   **Scalability of Iterations:** As noted, iterating through dynamic arrays or potentially all users for resolution/cancellation is gas-prohibitive for a high-traffic contract. A real DApp would require off-chain indexing or more sophisticated on-chain data structures (like linked lists per event for predictors) to manage large numbers of predictions and users.
*   **Oracle Integration:** The current oracle mechanism is just an address check. A real-world application would likely use a decentralized oracle network like Chainlink to fetch event outcomes securely and reliably.
*   **Reputation Complexity:** The reputation system is basic (+10 for win, -5 for loss). More advanced systems could weigh stakes, consider outcome odds, or decay over time.
*   **Event Creation Permissions:** Currently only owner can create events. This could be extended to allow users with a certain reputation or by staking collateral.
*   **Gas Costs of Strings:** Storing event descriptions and outcome strings on-chain can be costly. Hashing strings and storing hashes, with the full string stored off-chain, is a common optimization.
*   **Arbitration:** What if an event is resolved incorrectly? A dispute resolution mechanism (perhaps involving reputation or staked tokens) could be added.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a decentralized prediction game with an integrated reputation system, showcasing several non-trivial concepts and exceeding the 20-function requirement while avoiding simple duplication of basic ERC standards.
