 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - "ArtVerse"
 * @author Gemini AI
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective focused on collaborative art creation,
 *      dynamic NFT evolution, community-driven curation, and innovative financial mechanisms for artists and collectors.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Artist Management:**
 *    - `requestArtistMembership()`: Allows users to request to become artists in the collective.
 *    - `approveArtistMembership(address _artist)`: Admin function to approve pending artist membership requests.
 *    - `revokeArtistMembership(address _artist)`: Admin function to remove an artist from the collective.
 *    - `getArtistList()`: Returns a list of addresses of approved artists.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string memory _metadataURI, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Artists submit their artwork with metadata URI and initial price.
 *    - `curateArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Members can vote to curate submitted artworks.
 *    - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves the current curation status of an artwork (pending, curated, rejected).
 *    - `setCuratorThreshold(uint256 _threshold)`: Admin function to set the curation approval threshold.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic NFT Evolution & Traits:**
 *    - `mintEvolvingNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an "Evolving NFT" for a curated artwork, starting with base traits.
 *    - `evolveNFTTrait(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _traitName, string memory _newValue)`: Allows NFT holders to evolve specific traits of their NFT based on community votes or in-game achievements (concept).
 *    - `getNFTEvolutionHistory(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the evolution history of a specific NFT, showing trait changes over time.
 *
 * **4. Collaborative Art Creation (Concept):**
 *    - `proposeCollaboration(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _collaborationDescription)`: Artists can propose collaborations on existing curated artworks.
 *    - `voteOnCollaboration(uint256 _collaborationId, bool _approve)`: Community members vote on proposed collaborations.
 *    - `executeCollaboration(uint256 _collaborationId)`: If approved, executes the collaboration, potentially updating the artwork metadata or creating a derivative NFT.
 *
 * **5. Financial Mechanisms & Tokenomics (Concept - Requires external token integration for full functionality):**
 *    - `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase a curated artwork at its current price.
 *    - `offerBidOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _bidAmount)`: Allows users to place bids on artworks, potentially above the current price.
 *    - `acceptBid(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _bidId)`: Artwork owner can accept a high bid.
 *    - `withdrawFunds()`: Artists and the collective can withdraw their earned funds.
 *    - `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Admin function to set the platform fee percentage on sales.
 *
 * **6. Reputation & Reward System (Concept):**
 *    - `voteForReputation(address _member, uint256 _reputationPoints)`: Members can vote to give reputation points to other members for positive contributions.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a member.
 *    - `distributeRewards(uint256 _rewardAmount)`: Admin or DAO function to distribute rewards to high-reputation members (concept - reward mechanism needs further definition like token distribution).
 *
 * **7. Utility & Access Control:**
 *    - `setAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Admin function to change the contract admin.
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause most contract functionalities in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to resume contract functionalities.
 *    - `getContractBalance()`: Returns the contract's current ETH balance.
