/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Inspired by User Request)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) with advanced features.
 * It allows artists to submit artwork, community to vote on artwork for exhibition,
 * implements fractional ownership of art NFTs, dynamic pricing based on community engagement,
 * and introduces a reputation system for curators and artists.
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  **Core Functionality (Art Submission & Exhibition):**
 *     - submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice): Allows artists to submit artwork for consideration.
 *     - mintArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Mints an ERC721 NFT for an approved artwork (Curator/DAO controlled).
 *     - rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Rejects a submitted artwork (Curator/DAO controlled).
 *     - exhibitArtwork(uint256 _artworkId):  Sets an artwork as 'exhibited' in the gallery.
 *     - withdrawArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Removes an artwork from exhibition.
 *     - purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to purchase exhibited artwork NFTs.
 *     - getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): Returns detailed information about an artwork.
 *     - getGalleryArtworks(): Returns a list of artwork IDs currently in the gallery.
 *     - getExhibitedArtworks(): Returns a list of exhibited artwork IDs.
 *
 * 2.  **Decentralized Curation & Voting:**
 *     - startCurationRound(): Starts a new curation round for submitted artworks (Curator/DAO controlled).
 *     - voteForArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows community members to vote for artworks during a curation round.
 *     - endCurationRound(): Ends the current curation round and processes votes (Curator/DAO controlled).
 *     - getCurationRoundStatus(): Returns the status of the current or last curation round.
 *     - getCurationResults(uint256 _roundId): Returns the results of a specific curation round.
 *
 * 3.  **Fractional Ownership & Revenue Sharing:**
 *     - fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions): Allows fractionalizing an artwork NFT into ERC1155 tokens (Curator/DAO controlled, owner only).
 *     - purchaseFraction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _amount): Allows users to purchase fractions of an artwork.
 *     - redeemFractionsForNFT(uint256 _artworkId): Allows fraction holders to redeem fractions for the original NFT (if threshold reached - advanced concept).
 *     - distributeRevenue(uint256 _artworkId): Distributes revenue from fractional sales to fraction holders (Curator/DAO controlled).
 *
 * 4.  **Dynamic Pricing & Engagement:**
 *     - updatePriceBasedOnEngagement(uint256 _artworkId): Dynamically adjusts artwork price based on views, likes, or community engagement (Automated or Curator/DAO triggered).
 *     - recordArtworkView(uint256 _artworkId): Records a view for an artwork, contributing to engagement metrics.
 *     - getArtworkEngagementScore(uint256 _artworkId): Returns the engagement score for an artwork.
 *
 * 5.  **Reputation System (Curators & Artists - Advanced Concept):**
 *     - upvoteCurator(address _curatorAddress): Allows community to upvote curators for good performance.
 *     - downvoteCurator(address _curatorAddress): Allows community to downvote curators for poor performance.
 *     - getCuratorReputation(address _curatorAddress): Returns the reputation score of a curator.
 *     - reportArtist(address _artistAddress, string _reason): Allows reporting artists for policy violations.
 *     - getArtistReportCount(address _artistAddress): Returns the report count for an artist.
 *
 * 6.  **Gallery Management & Settings:**
 *     - setGalleryName(string _name): Sets the name of the art gallery (Owner controlled).
 *     - setCurator(address _curatorAddress, bool _isCurator): Adds or removes a curator (Owner controlled).
 *     - changeVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration): Changes the duration of curation rounds (Owner/DAO controlled).
 *     - setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Sets a gallery fee percentage on sales (Owner controlled).
 *     - withdrawGalleryFees(): Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 *
 * 7.  **Utility Functions:**
 *     - isCurator(address _address): Checks if an address is a curator.
 *     - isArtworkApproved(uint256 _artworkId): Checks if an artwork is approved for minting.
 *     - getContractBalance(): Returns the contract's ETH balance.
 *
 * This contract is designed to be highly customizable and can be further extended with DAO governance for even greater decentralization.
