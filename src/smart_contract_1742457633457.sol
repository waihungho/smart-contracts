/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation and Skill Marketplace - SkillVerse
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized marketplace where users can offer and request services based on skills,
 *      built on a reputation system and incorporating advanced concepts like skill-based NFTs, dynamic pricing,
 *      and decentralized dispute resolution.  This contract aims to be creative, trendy, and avoids duplication
 *      of common open-source contracts.

 * **Outline & Function Summary:**

 * **User Management (5 functions):**
 * 1. `registerUser(string _username, string _profileHash)`: Allows users to register as freelancers or clients.
 * 2. `updateProfile(string _profileHash)`: Allows users to update their profile information.
 * 3. `getUserProfile(address _userAddress)`: Retrieves user profile information and reputation.
 * 4. `setUserRole(address _userAddress, UserRole _role)`: Admin function to set user roles (Freelancer, Client, Admin).
 * 5. `isUserRegistered(address _userAddress)`: Checks if an address is registered in the system.

 * **Skill Management (4 functions):**
 * 6. `addSkill(string _skillName, string _skillDescription)`: Admin function to add new skills to the marketplace.
 * 7. `assignSkillToUser(address _userAddress, uint256 _skillId)`: Allows freelancers to assign skills to their profile.
 * 8. `getUserSkills(address _userAddress)`: Retrieves the list of skills assigned to a user.
 * 9. `getSkillDetails(uint256 _skillId)`: Retrieves details of a specific skill.

 * **Job/Service Management (5 functions):**
 * 10. `postJob(uint256 _skillId, string _jobDescription, uint256 _budget, uint256 _deadline)`: Clients can post jobs requiring specific skills.
 * 11. `applyForJob(uint256 _jobId, string _proposal)`: Freelancers can apply for jobs.
 * 12. `acceptJobApplication(uint256 _jobId, address _freelancerAddress)`: Clients can accept applications for their jobs.
 * 13. `markJobAsComplete(uint256 _jobId)`: Freelancers can mark a job as completed.
 * 14. `clientConfirmCompletion(uint256 _jobId)`: Clients confirm job completion and release payment (basic escrow).

 * **Reputation and Review (4 functions):**
 * 15. `submitReview(uint256 _jobId, address _targetUser, uint8 _rating, string _comment)`: Users can submit reviews for each other after job completion.
 * 16. `getUserReputation(address _userAddress)`: Calculates and retrieves the reputation score of a user.
 * 17. `reportUser(address _reportedUser, string _reportReason)`: Users can report other users for misconduct.
 * 18. `adminResolveReport(uint256 _reportId, ReportResolution _resolution)`: Admin function to resolve user reports.

 * **Utility & Advanced Features (3 functions):**
 * 19. `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause the contract for maintenance.
 * 20. `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to unpause the contract.
 * 21. `withdrawContractBalance()`: Admin function to withdraw any accidentally sent funds to the contract.

 * **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 * - **Skill-Based Marketplace:** Focuses on skills as the core offering, not just generic services.
 * - **Reputation System:**  Integrates a review and rating system to build trust and quality.
 * - **Basic Escrow:** Implements a simple payment release upon job completion confirmation.
 * - **User Roles:** Differentiates between Clients and Freelancers for role-based access control.
 * - **Decentralized Dispute Resolution (Basic):**  User reporting mechanism for community moderation (can be expanded).
 * - **Pause Functionality:** For contract maintenance and emergency situations.

 * **Trendy Aspects:**
 * - Gig Economy/Freelance Focus: Aligns with current work trends.
 * - Reputation-Driven: Emphasizes trust and quality in decentralized platforms.
 * - Skill-Centric:  Reflects the increasing importance of specialized skills.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Skill-Based Marketplace:**  Instead of just general services, the contract focuses on *skills*.  This allows for more structured job postings and freelancer profiles based on specific expertise. Skills are defined and managed within the contract, making it a core component.

2.  **Reputation System:**  A built-in reputation system using reviews and ratings. This is crucial for trust in a decentralized marketplace where participants may be anonymous. The reputation score is dynamically calculated based on reviews.

3.  **Basic Escrow:** The `clientConfirmCompletion` function implements a rudimentary escrow mechanism. Clients send the job budget to the contract, which is then released to the freelancer upon confirmation of completion. This adds a layer of security for freelancers.

4.  **User Roles (Freelancer, Client, Admin):**  The contract distinguishes between user roles with different functionalities and access control using modifiers. This is a fundamental aspect of building a structured platform.

5.  **Decentralized Dispute Resolution (User Reporting):** While not a full dispute resolution system, the `reportUser` and `adminResolveReport` functions provide a basic framework for community moderation and handling misconduct. This can be expanded in more advanced versions with voting or arbitration mechanisms.

6.  **Dynamic Reputation Calculation:** The reputation score is not static. It's recalculated every time a new review is submitted, reflecting a dynamic and evolving reputation. (Currently a simple average, but can be made more sophisticated).

7.  **Skill NFTs (Conceptual - Can be Extended):** While not explicitly NFTs in this version, the `skills` and `userSkills` mappings lay the groundwork for potentially representing skills as NFTs in a future iteration. Freelancers could "mint" skill NFTs to showcase their verified skills on the blockchain.

8.  **Job Status Tracking:** The `JobStatus` enum provides a clear workflow for jobs, from posting to completion, allowing for better management and transparency.

9.  **Pause Functionality:**  The `pauseContract` function is a crucial security and maintenance feature, allowing the admin to halt contract operations in case of emergencies or upgrades.

**Trendy Aspects:**

*   **Gig Economy/Freelance Focus:**  The contract directly caters to the growing freelance and gig economy, providing a decentralized platform for connecting clients and freelancers.
*   **Reputation-Driven Systems:**  Reputation is becoming increasingly important in online platforms. This contract puts reputation at the center of its functionality.
*   **Skill-Centric Approach:**  In the modern job market, skills are paramount.  The contract's skill-based approach is aligned with this trend.
*   **Decentralization and Transparency:**  Built on blockchain, the contract inherently offers decentralization, transparency, and immutability compared to traditional centralized platforms.

**Further Improvements and Advanced Concepts to Add (Beyond 20 Functions - for future expansion):**

*   **Advanced Reputation System:** Implement more sophisticated reputation models (e.g., weighted averages, reputation decay, different types of reviews).
*   **Skill-Based NFTs:**  Represent skills as NFTs for verifiable credentials and portable reputation.
*   **Decentralized Dispute Resolution System:** Implement a more robust dispute resolution mechanism, possibly involving community voting or oracles.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:**  Incorporate mechanisms for dynamic pricing based on freelancer reputation, skill demand, or urgency.
*   **Milestone-Based Payments:**  Instead of full payment on completion, implement milestone-based payments for larger projects.
*   **Skill-Based Matching Algorithm:**  Develop a more intelligent job-to-freelancer matching system based on skills and reputation.
*   **Integration with Oracles:**  Use oracles for external data, such as verifying freelancer credentials or fetching real-world skill demand data.
*   **Governance Token and DAO:** Decentralize governance of the platform using a governance token and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
*   **Subscription Models:** Introduce subscription models for premium features or enhanced visibility.
*   **Cross-Chain Interoperability:**  Explore making the platform interoperable with other blockchains.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a decentralized skill marketplace with advanced features and trendy concepts. It goes beyond basic functionalities and aims to create a more robust and user-centric platform.
