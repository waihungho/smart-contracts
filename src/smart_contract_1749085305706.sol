Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts, aiming for at least 20 distinct functionalities without directly duplicating standard open-source contracts like basic ERC-20, ERC-721, or simple staking/vaults (though it builds *upon* vault concepts).

The core idea is a "Quantum Vault" that manages multiple assets and operates in different "Dimensions" or states, influenced by external factors (simulated oracle) and internal mechanisms (time, commitments), with dynamic fees, rewards, and basic governance.

    // Value calculation requires external price data (simulated via oracle).

    function totalAssets() public view returns (uint256 totalValueUSD) {
        // Calculates the total value of all assets in the vault in USD (simulated).
        // This requires up-to-date oracle data for each asset's price feed.
        // For this example, we simulate a single 'lastOracleData' representing a general market index or total vault value factor.
        // A real implementation would integrate with Chainlink or similar for multiple asset prices.

        // Simplified calculation: total value = total shares * sharesPerUSD (derived from oracle)
        // Or value = sum(assetBalance * assetPrice)
        // Let's use a simple ratio based on a 'virtual' USD value tied to oracle data.
        // totalVaultShares * (approx USD value per share)
        // We need a reference point. Let's say 1 share aims to be roughly 1 USD initially.
        // value = (totalVaultShares * lastOracleData) / 1e18 // Example: if lastOracleData is a multiplier/index

        // More realistic approach: sum(assetBalances[asset] * price[asset])
        // Since we only have one `lastOracleData`, let's make it a general health/value index where:
        // 1e18 represents a baseline. Value scales with this index.
        // Total value is proportional to total shares AND the oracle index.
        // Let's assume 1 share is initially valued at 1e18 "value units".
        // The value of all assets is (totalVaultShares * lastOracleData) / 1e18.
        // This is highly simplified. A real multi-asset vault needs asset-specific price feeds.

        // To avoid complexity of multiple price feeds in this example,
        // let's calculate total value based on deposited amounts and a SIMULATED fixed value per unit, adjusted by oracle data.
        // This is conceptual. totalAssets here represents a proportional value unit, not true USD.
        // Let's assume 1 unit of any supported asset is *roughly* equivalent for simplicity, adjusted by a factor if needed.
        // A more robust method is summing assetBalances * getAssetPrice(asset).
        // Let's simulate a simple total value representation:
        // total value = SUM(assetBalances[asset] * some_weight_or_price_factor)
        // Weighted sum + apply oracle index? Too complex for simple example.
        // Let's fallback to the simplest possible interpretation for demonstrating the vault concept:
        // total value is proportional to total shares, and the value *per share* changes based on oracle data.
        // A share's value = (baseline_value_per_share * lastOracleData) / baseline_oracle_data.
        // Let baseline_value_per_share = 1e18, baseline_oracle_data = 1e18.
        // Value per share = (1e18 * lastOracleData) / 1e18 = lastOracleData.
        // Total value = totalVaultShares * (lastOracleData / 1e18).
        // If lastOracleData is 1e18, value per share is 1. If oracle data changes, share value changes.
        // This simulates investment performance tied to the oracle feed.
        // Total value in 'value units':
        if (totalVaultShares == 0) {
             return 0;
        }
        // Value per share (in internal value units, scaled by 1e18):
        // Let's use a different approach: Track the total value *at the time of the last share mint/burn*
        // This requires tracking a `totalValueLastUpdated` state variable.
        // Or, track total `value units` contributed.
        // Let's re-think: Shares represent a claim on asset *quantity*, not *value*.
        // This is simpler and avoids complex oracle value conversions for deposit/withdraw.
        // `totalAssets` then means the sum of ALL raw asset balances (maybe weighted).
        // This is still not truly standard.
        // Let's make shares represent proportional ownership of the *quantity* of each asset.
        // shares_of_asset_X = (user_shares / totalVaultShares) * assetBalances[assetX]
        // totalAssets would then need to return a mapping or struct? No, ERC-4626 returns one value.
        // Okay, back to basics: ERC-4626 is for ONE asset. We *must* adapt or break the pattern.
        // Let's break the strict ERC-4626 adherence but keep the function *names* and *purpose* (deposit for shares, shares for assets).
        // `totalAssets()` will return the sum of *one specific designated reference asset* or a calculated index.
        // Let's return `totalVaultShares` as a proxy for total "value units" or scale. This is the least confusing way to fit the signature.
        // A real multi-asset vault might use an index token or LP token as its 'shares' and calculate NAV.
        return totalVaultShares; // Simulating total 'value' being proportional to total shares
    }

    // --- Multi-Asset Vault Core (Adaptation) ---

    // Returns the number of shares that would be minted for a given deposit *of a specific asset*.
    // Adaptation: Need to specify which asset is deposited.
    // Let's rename these slightly or add asset parameter. ERC-4626 doesn't have this.
    // The user deposits a mapping or array of amounts? Or calls `deposit(asset, amount)`?
    // `deposit(amount, recipient)` is the ERC-4626 signature.
    // Okay, let's make `deposit` and `withdraw` take a *single* asset and amount for simplicity,
    // while `totalAssets` and conversions operate on the *total* value concept (even if simplified).

    // How many shares receive for `assets` amount of ONE specific `depositAsset`?
    // Shares are minted based on the total value provided / value per share.
    // Value per share calculation is the trickiest part in multi-asset.
    // Value per share = total_value_in_vault / totalVaultShares.
    // If totalVaultShares == 0, value_per_share = some initial price (e.g., 1e18).
    // If totalVaultShares > 0, value_per_share = totalAssets() / totalVaultShares.
    // shares to mint = (deposit_amount * price_of_deposit_asset) / value_per_share
    // This *still* requires price feeds per asset.

    // Let's use a *simpler* multi-asset model:
    // Shares represent a proportional claim on the *sum of balances* of all assets, maybe weighted.
    // Share price is SUM(assetBalances[asset] * weight[asset]) / totalVaultShares.
    // Weighting requires more config. Let's assume equal weighting for simplicity.
    // Share price = SUM(assetBalances) / totalVaultShares. This only works if assets have similar value.
    // Let's use the `totalVaultShares` as the measure of 'value units' as planned earlier.
    // Then depositing assets *increases* the total 'value units' represented by `totalVaultShares`.
    // How many shares to give? If you deposit `amount` of `asset`, how much 'value' does that add?
    // value_added = amount * getAssetValueInVaultUnits(asset, amount).
    // Shares minted = (value_added * totalVaultShares) / total_value_before.
    // Total value before = totalVaultShares (by our simplified model).
    // This implies Shares minted = value_added. This is too simple.

    // Let's go back to shares representing proportional ownership of QUANTITY of assets.
    // If you deposit 100 USDC and total vault has 1000 USDC and 500 ETH, and total shares is 1000.
    // Shares represent 1 unit of total asset quantity (summing quantities).
    // If you add 100 USDC, total quantity sum increases.
    // This only works if assets are homogenous (all stablecoins, or all units of computation).
    // It breaks down with USDC and ETH.

    // Final attempt at a simplified multi-asset model for this example:
    // Shares are minted based on the *ratio* of the *value* of deposited assets
    // to the *current total value* of the vault's holdings.
    // Value is calculated using `lastOracleData` as a multiplier applied to a baseline.
    // Assume 1 unit of any supported asset has a baseline value of 1 unit.
    // Total vault value = SUM(assetBalances[asset]) * (lastOracleData / 1e18).
    // Value per share = Total vault value / totalVaultShares.
    // Shares to mint for depositing `amount` of `asset`:
    // Value of deposit = amount * (lastOracleData / 1e18). (Assuming a fixed asset-to-value ratio modified by oracle)
    // Shares minted = (Value of deposit / Value per share) = (amount * (lastOracleData / 1e18)) / (Total vault value / totalVaultShares)
    // Shares minted = (amount * (lastOracleData / 1e18) * totalVaultShares) / (SUM(assetBalances) * (lastOracleData / 1e18))
    // Shares minted = (amount * totalVaultShares) / SUM(assetBalances) -- if oracle data is up to date and same for all
    // This requires SUM(assetBalances). Let's track `totalSupportedAssetUnits`

    uint256 private totalSupportedAssetUnits = 0; // Sum of all assetBalances - highly simplified proxy for total quantity/value base

    function convertToShares(address depositAsset, uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256 shares) {
        require(supportedAssets[depositAsset], "QV: Asset not supported");
        if (totalVaultShares == 0 || totalSupportedAssetUnits == 0) {
            return assets; // 1:1 conversion initially (conceptual)
        }
        // Shares = (assets * totalVaultShares) / totalSupportedAssetUnits;
        // This is a basic proportional ratio based on total asset units vs total shares.
        // Incorporate oracle influence: value per share is affected by oracle.
        // Let's say shares track the value *relative* to the oracle data.
        // Share price = (initialSharePrice * lastOracleData) / initialOracleData
        // Deposit value = assets * initialAssetPrice * (lastOracleData / initialOracleData)
        // Shares = deposit_value / share_price
        // Shares = (assets * initialAssetPrice * (lastOracleData / initialOracleData)) / ((initialSharePrice * lastOracleData) / initialOracleData)
        // Shares = (assets * initialAssetPrice) / initialSharePrice -- This means oracle cancels out if applied uniformly?
        // This is still complex. Let's use the simplest: Shares are proportional to the contribution to `totalSupportedAssetUnits`.
        // And `totalVaultShares` tracks these "value units".
        // If you add `assets` units of `depositAsset`, you increase `totalSupportedAssetUnits` by `assets`.

             // This is complex. Let's assume dimensionRewardPool is the total EXTRA reward.
             // Base rewards (yield from strategies) are assumed to increase totalSupportedAssetUnits or assetBalances directly.
             // The `rewardMultiplier` applies to a conceptual "base yield".

             // A real solution uses a pull mechanism or iteration limits.
             // For demonstration, iterate through supportedAssetList as a proxy for users (bad design!).
             // Need a way to iterate users... impossible directly.
             // Rewards MUST be pull-based.
             // Let's revert `claimDimensionRewards` to be the PULL function,
             // and `distributeDimensionRewards` updates an ACCRUAL state per user.

             // --- Re-designing Rewards (Pull Based) ---
             // Need mapping user -> asset -> accrued reward amount
             // Need state to track last distribution point (e.g., total shares * time) to calculate accrued yield per share.
             // This is getting very complex.

             // Let's stick to the simpler model: `setRewardPool` adds tokens to the contract,
             // `claimDimensionRewards` lets users claim their share based on current holdings from the *vault balance*.
             // `dimensionRewardPool` just indicates what was *intended* for this dimension.

             // Let's make distributeDimensionRewards actually transfer rewards *into* the `userRewards` mapping.
             // This still requires iterating users... unless using a simpler pool claim.

             // Simpler pull mechanism: The `dimensionRewardPool` represents the total rewards added by owner/gov *for this specific dimension*.
             // Users claim from this pool based on their shares *when they call claim*.
             // This is the first simplified model described. Let's make that work.
             // The `dimensionRewardPool[asset]` is the pool.
             // `claimDimensionRewards` calculates proportion `vaultSharesOf[msg.sender] / totalVaultShares * dimensionRewardPool[asset]`
             // and transfers from `assetBalances[asset]`, reducing `dimensionRewardPool[asset]`.

             // `distributeDimensionRewards` then becomes a redundant function if `setRewardPool` and `claimDimensionRewards` handle it.
             // Let's use `setRewardPool` to add funds to `assetBalances` AND mark them as available in `dimensionRewardPool`.
             // `claimDimensionRewards` calculates claimable amount based on `dimensionRewardPool` and transfers from `assetBalances`.

**Explanation of Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vault (Adapted ERC-4626):**
    *   Instead of a single `asset()`, the vault supports multiple assets listed in `supportedAssets`.
    *   `assetBalances` tracks the quantity of each supported asset held.
    *   `totalVaultShares` represents the total supply of shares, and `vaultSharesOf` tracks user balances.
    *   The core logic (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `mint`, `redeem`) is adapted. Users deposit/withdraw/redeem a *specific* asset, and shares are minted/burned based on a simplified value calculation relative to the vault's total (tracked via `totalSupportedAssetUnits` which is a conceptual sum of quantities). This deviates from standard ERC-4626 which is single-asset and calculates shares based on the *value* of the single underlying asset.
    *   `totalAssets()` returns `totalVaultShares` as a proxy for the vault's size/value in this simplified model.
    *   `convertToShares` and `convertToAssets` implement the core share-to-asset conversion logic based on the simplified quantity model (`totalSupportedAssetUnits` vs `totalVaultShares`).
    *   `preview*` and `max*` functions provide estimates based on the conversion logic and vault/user balances/caps.
    *   Functions: `addSupportedAsset`, `removeSupportedAsset`, `getAssetBalance`, `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw`, `redeem`, `totalAssets`, `convertToShares`, `convertToAssets`, `previewDeposit`, `previewMint`, `previewWithdraw`, `previewRedeem`, `maxDeposit`, `maxMint`, `maxWithdraw`, `maxRedeem`.

2.  **Dimension System:**
    *   The contract can exist in different `Dimension` states (`Stable`, `Volatile`, `Locked`, `QuantumFluctuation`).
    *   Each dimension has configurable `DimensionParameters` like fees, reward multipliers, and lock-up durations.
    *   `currentDimension` tracks the active state.
    *   `triggerDimensionTransition` allows switching between states based on external or internal conditions (simulated here by `triggerValue`).
    *   `dimensionEntryTime` tracks when a user last entered the *current* dimension state (used for lock-ups).
    *   Functions: `getCurrentDimension`, `setDimensionParameters`, `triggerDimensionTransition`, `getDimensionParameters`.

3.  **Oracle Integration (Simulated):**
    *   `oracle` address is trusted to provide external data.
    *   `lastOracleData` and `lastOracleUpdateTimestamp` store the latest data point and its age.
    *   `updateOracleData` allows the oracle to push new data.
    *   This data can be used by `triggerDimensionTransition` or influence internal calculations (though simplified in this example).
    *   Functions: `setOracleAddress`, `updateOracleData`, `getOracleData`.

4.  **Dynamic Fees & Rewards:**
    *   Deposit and withdrawal fees are calculated based on the `dimensionConfigs`.
    *   `protocolFees` tracks accumulated fees per asset.
    *   `collectProtocolFees` allows owner/governance to withdraw fees.
    *   A simplified reward mechanism: `dimensionRewardPool` holds assets intended for rewards in the current dimension. `setRewardPool` adds assets to this pool. `claimDimensionRewards` allows users to claim a proportional share of the available pool from the vault's balance based on their current shares. (Note: A real system would likely use snapshotting or yield-farming calculations for fairer distribution).
    *   Functions: `calculateDimensionFee` (internal), `claimDimensionRewards`, `setRewardPool`, `collectProtocolFees`.

5.  **Commitment Scheme:**
    *   Users can `submitCommitment` to a hashed value.
    *   They can later `revealCommitment` within a time window, proving they knew the original value.
    *   This can be tied to accessing features or rewards in specific dimensions (`QuantumFluctuation`).
    *   A `simulateVDFVerification` function is included conceptually, demonstrating that the reveal could be subject to a complex, verifiable computation check.
    *   Functions: `submitCommitment`, `revealCommitment`, `checkCommitmentStatus`, `simulateVDFVerification`.

6.  **Basic Governance:**
    *   A simple proposal system where proposals target specific function calls on the contract.
    *   `proposeParameterChange` allows creating proposals.
    *   `voteOnProposal` allows users (or a defined voting body - simplified here to any address) to vote.
    *   `executeProposal` allows the owner/governance to execute proposals that meet a threshold after the voting period ends.
    *   Functions: `proposeParameterChange`, `voteOnProposal`, `executeProposal`, `getProposal`.

7.  **Emergency & Utility:**
    *   `emergencyWithdraw` allows the owner/governance to rescue assets in emergencies.
    *   `setDepositCap` allows setting limits on total asset balances to manage risk.
    *   `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` provide general halting functionality.
    *   Functions: `emergencyWithdraw`, `setDepositCap`, `getDepositCap`, `pauseContract`, `unpauseContract`.

This contract combines several mechanisms – dynamic state, oracle dependency, multi-asset management (in a custom way), commitment/reveal, simulated advanced crypto interaction, and basic governance – to create a complex and interesting contract demonstrating various advanced Solidity concepts beyond a simple token or single-purpose DeFi protocol. It also avoids direct inheritance or significant code reuse from standard OpenZeppelin contracts (implementing basic Ownable and Pausable manually, and adapting ERC-4626 ideas rather than implementing the interface directly for a single asset).
