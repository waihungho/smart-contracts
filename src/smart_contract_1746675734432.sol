Okay, let's design an interesting, advanced, and creative smart contract that isn't a direct copy of common open-source patterns.

How about a **Neural Network Governance DAO (`NeuralNetDao`)**?

This contract will govern parameters and operations for a hypothetical decentralized neural network (the computation of which would happen off-chain, as complex AI is not feasible on-chain). The DAO members propose and vote on things like:

1.  **Model Parameters:** Approving sets of hyperparameters or even simplified model structures represented by hashes.
2.  **Training Data:** Approving sources or criteria for training data.
3.  **Contributor Rewards:** Allocating funds to data providers or nodes performing training/inference (based on oracle reports).
4.  **Performance Targets:** Setting goals the model should aim for.
5.  **System Updates:** Pausing, unpausing, or even upgrading the contract (via proxy pattern, although we'll represent the *ability* to propose this).

This concept is advanced because it links on-chain governance to a complex off-chain process (AI/ML). It requires integrating with oracles (simulated here) to get off-chain data (like performance metrics or proof of contribution). It's creative because it applies DAO principles to a non-traditional domain like AI model development. It's trendy due to the focus on AI and decentralized governance.

We will need a governance token for voting power and staking, but we'll define a placeholder interface for it within the same file for simplicity, assuming it's an ERC20 standard or similar.

**Contract Name:** `NeuralNetDao`

**Description:** A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) contract designed to govern parameters, operations, and resource allocation for a hypothetical decentralized neural network. It manages membership, proposals, voting, treasury funds, and interacts with oracles to incorporate off-chain information regarding model performance and contributor contributions.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **DAO Governance:** Member-based proposal and voting system.
*   **Abstracted AI/ML:** Manages parameters and state updates related to a hypothetical decentralized neural network (computation off-chain).
*   **Treasury Management:** Holds and allocates funds (ETH or ERC20) via proposals.
*   **Contributor System:** Allows registration, staking, and reward claims for contributors (data providers, trainers, etc.) based on oracle reports.
*   **Oracle Integration:** Designed to receive data from trusted oracle addresses regarding model performance and contributor actions.
*   **Pausable:** Emergency pause mechanism controlled by DAO proposal.
*   **Internal Target Calls:** DAO execution triggers internal functions for state changes.

**Dependencies:**
*   OpenZeppelin Contracts (ERC20, Pausable, Ownable - for Oracle management)

**Outline:**
1.  **State Variables:** Store DAO configuration, proposals, members, contributors, model state, oracle addresses.
2.  **Enums:** Define proposal states.
3.  **Structs:** Define data structures for proposals and contributors.
4.  **Events:** Announce key actions (proposals, votes, execution, contributions, state changes).
5.  **Modifiers:** Control access (`onlyMember`, `onlySelf`, `onlyOracle`, `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`).
6.  **Core DAO Logic:**
    *   Constructor: Initialize contract, set initial parameters.
    *   Membership Management (handled via proposals).
    *   Proposal System: Create, vote, queue, execute, cancel proposals.
    *   Treasury: Receive funds, execute transfers via proposals.
7.  **Neural Net Specifics (Abstracted):**
    *   Functions to update model version, hyperparameters, performance metrics (triggered by execution or oracles).
8.  **Contributor Management:**
    *   Register, stake, unstake, claim rewards.
    *   Function for oracles to report contributor performance.
9.  **Oracle Management:**
    *   Owner sets allowed oracle addresses.
10. **Utility Functions:** View functions to query state.
11. **Internal Target Functions:** Functions prefixed with `_` designed to be called *only* by the contract itself during proposal execution.

**Function Summary (>= 20 Functions):**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes the DAO with governance token, initial members, voting parameters, and oracle manager.
2.  `createProposal`: Allows a member to create a new proposal with a target address, value, calldata, and description.
3.  `voteOnProposal`: Allows a member to cast a vote (for/against) on an active proposal. Requires staking/locking voting power (simplified here).
4.  `queueProposal`: Moves a successful proposal to the execution queue after the voting period ends and quorum/threshold are met. Implements a timelock.
5.  `executeProposal`: Executes the action of a queued proposal after its timelock has passed.
6.  `cancelProposal`: Allows the proposer to cancel their own proposal before voting ends or under specific conditions.
7.  `getProposalState`: View function to get the current state of a proposal.
8.  `getProposalInfo`: View function to get all details about a specific proposal.
9.  `registerContributor`: Allows an external address to register as a potential contributor (data provider, trainer).
10. `stakeForContribution`: Allows a registered contributor to stake governance tokens to participate and be eligible for rewards.
11. `unstakeContribution`: Allows a contributor to unstake their tokens after a cooldown period or when eligible.
12. `reportContributionPerformance`: (Only callable by Oracle) Records performance or contribution points for a contributor, making them eligible for rewards.
13. `claimContributionRewards`: Allows a contributor to claim accrued rewards based on their reported performance and available treasury funds (simplified reward pool logic).
14. `updateModelMetrics`: (Only callable by Oracle) Updates the on-chain record of the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency), based on off-chain evaluation.
15. `getContributorInfo`: View function to get staking amount, performance points, and claimed rewards for a contributor.
16. `getDaoTreasuryBalance`: View function to get the ETH balance held by the contract.
17. `getMemberCount`: View function to get the total number of DAO members.
18. `getProposalCount`: View function to get the total number of proposals created.
19. `isMember`: View function to check if an address is currently a DAO member.
20. `getTotalStakedByContributor`: View function to get the total staked amount by a specific contributor.
21. `_addMember`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`) Function executed via proposal to add a new DAO member.
22. `_removeMember`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`) Function executed via proposal to remove a DAO member.
23. `_setMinimumStake`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`) Function executed via proposal to change the minimum staking requirement for contributors.
24. `_setVotingPeriod`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`) Function executed via proposal to change the duration proposals are open for voting.
25. `_updateModelVersion`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`) Function executed via proposal to record a new version hash/identifier for the governed neural network model.
26. `_pauseContract`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`, `whenNotPaused`) Function executed via proposal to pause the contract.
27. `_unpauseContract`: (Internal Target, `onlySelf`, `whenPaused`) Function executed via proposal to unpause the contract.
28. `setOracleAddress`: (Only Owner) Sets the address allowed to call oracle-restricted functions.
29. `getOracleAddress`: View function to get the current oracle address.
30. `receive()`: Payable function to receive ETH donations into the treasury.

This list contains 30 functions, exceeding the minimum requirement and covering various aspects of the concept.

**Explanation of Advanced/Interesting Concepts Used:**

1.  **DAO for Off-Chain AI:** The core concept is governing a non-blockchain process (AI development/operation) using on-chain mechanics (DAO). This requires careful separation of concerns – the contract governs *parameters* and *resource allocation*, relying on off-chain agents (oracles, contributors) to perform the actual computation and reporting.
2.  **Oracle Integration:** The contract has explicit functions (`reportContributionPerformance`, `updateModelMetrics`) designed to be called *only* by a trusted oracle address. This is a common pattern for bringing real-world or computationally intensive data onto the blockchain in a controlled manner. `Ownable` is used here to manage the oracle address itself.
3.  **Internal Target Calls via Proposals:** The `executeProposal` function uses low-level `call` with arbitrary `target`, `value`, and `callData`. This allows the DAO to trigger *any* function on *any* contract (including itself) with parameters. The functions prefixed with `_` (`_addMember`, `_pauseContract`, etc.) are specifically designed to be targets for these internal DAO executions, restricted by the `onlySelf` modifier. This is a powerful and flexible DAO execution pattern.
4.  **Contributor Staking & Performance-Based Rewards:** The contract introduces a system for external contributors to stake governance tokens and earn rewards based on their performance reported by an oracle. This is a simplified model of how decentralized work contribution platforms (like decentralized rendering, data labeling, or AI training) might integrate with tokenomics. The `claimContributionRewards` function represents a mechanism for distributing value based on off-chain proof-of-work/contribution vouched for by the oracle.
5.  **Pausable via Governance:** Instead of a single owner being able to pause the contract, the `_pauseContract` and `_unpauseContract` functions are internal targets callable *only* via a successful DAO proposal execution. This decentralizes emergency control.
6.  **Structured Proposals:** The `Proposal` struct captures significant detail including target address, value, calldata, and a timelock, allowing for complex actions to be governed, not just simple token transfers or parameter changes.
7.  **Proposal State Machine:** The `ProposalState` enum and `getProposalState` function define a clear lifecycle for proposals (Pending, Active, Succeeded, Queued, Executed, etc.), managing the flow from creation to completion or failure. Includes concepts like quorum, voting period, and execution timelock.
8.  **Simplified Voting Power:** While the example uses 1 member = 1 vote for simplicity in the `voteOnProposal` function, the structure is compatible with integrating more complex voting power based on staked tokens or token balances at a specific block height (as is common in many DAOs, often requiring a separate voting-escrow or snapshot mechanism, which `INNDToken` interface hints at with `lockTokens`/`unlockTokens`).
9.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Used to prevent reentrancy attacks, especially important in `executeProposal` which makes external calls.
10. **OpenZeppelin Libraries:** Leverages battle-tested standards (`IERC20`, `Pausable`, `Ownable`, `SafeMath`, `ReentrancyGuard`) for security and efficiency, which is a best practice in Solidity development.

This contract is a conceptual framework. A real-world implementation would require significantly more complex logic for reward calculation, oracle security (multiple oracles, reputation), contributor slashing/penalties for poor performance or malicious behavior, and a robust off-chain system interacting with the contract. However, it demonstrates a creative application of smart contract principles to a non-standard domain with several advanced features.
