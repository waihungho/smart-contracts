 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract Outline
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to collaborate, curate, and monetize digital art in novel ways.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * --- Artist Management ---
 * 1. requestArtistMembership(): Allows anyone to request to become an artist member.
 * 2. approveArtistMembership(address _artist): Governance function to approve pending artist membership requests.
 * 3. revokeArtistMembership(address _artist): Governance function to revoke artist membership.
 * 4. getArtistList(): Returns a list of current artist members.
 * 5. isArtist(address _account): Checks if an address is a registered artist.
 *
 * --- Art Submission & Curation ---
 * 6. submitArtProposal(string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _title, string memory _description): Artists propose new artwork for the collective.
 * 7. voteOnArtProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Artists vote on submitted art proposals.
 * 8. getArtProposalDetails(uint _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific art proposal.
 * 9. getApprovedArtworks(): Returns a list of IPFS hashes of approved artworks.
 * 10. reportInappropriateArt(uint _artworkId): Allows users to report artwork deemed inappropriate (triggers governance review).
 *
 * --- Revenue & Royalties ---
 * 11. purchaseArtworkNFT(uint _artworkId): Allows users to purchase an NFT representing an approved artwork.
 * 12. setArtworkPrice(uint _artworkId, uint _price): Artist function to set the price of their submitted and approved artwork.
 * 13. withdrawArtistEarnings(): Artists can withdraw their accumulated earnings from artwork sales.
 * 14. setCollectiveRoyalty(uint _royaltyPercentage): Governance function to set the collective royalty percentage on artwork sales.
 * 15. distributeCollectiveRevenue(): Governance function to distribute collective revenue (e.g., to artists, treasury, etc. - logic can be customized).
 *
 * --- Governance & Community ---
 * 16. createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata): Allows artists to create governance proposals for contract changes.
 * 17. voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Artists vote on governance proposals.
 * 18. executeGovernanceProposal(uint _proposalId): Governance function to execute approved governance proposals.
 * 19. getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific governance proposal.
 * 20. donateToCollective(): Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective's treasury.
 * 21. pauseContract(): Governance function to pause core contract functionalities in emergency situations.
 * 22. unpauseContract(): Governance function to unpause contract functionalities.
 * 23. getContractState(): Returns the current state of the contract (paused/unpaused).
 *
 * --- Advanced/Trendy Features ---
 * 24. fractionalizeArtworkNFT(uint _artworkId, uint _numberOfFractions): Allows artists to fractionalize their approved artwork NFTs (advanced NFT concept).
 * 25. createArtChallenge(string memory _challengeDescription, uint _submissionDeadline): Governance function to create art challenges for the community.
 * 26. submitChallengeEntry(uint _challengeId, string memory _ipfsHash): Artists submit artwork entries for active art challenges.
 * 27. voteOnChallengeEntry(uint _challengeId, uint _entryId, bool _vote): Artists vote on challenge entries to determine winners.
 * 28. awardChallengeWinners(uint _challengeId): Governance function to award prizes to challenge winners (prize mechanism needs further definition - could be NFTs, tokens, etc.).
 * 29. setCuratorRole(address _curator, bool _isCurator): Governance function to assign/revoke curator roles (curators can have special privileges, e.g., faster art approval - can be implemented in further iterations).
