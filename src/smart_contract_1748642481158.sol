Okay, this sounds like a fun challenge! Let's build a contract around managing abstract, dynamic "Data Fragments" that represent concepts, influenced by oracles and user interactions. It will use ERC-1155 for the fragments themselves but add complex state and logic on top.

**Contract Name:** `SolidityGPTArchive`

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This contract manages abstract "Data Fragments" represented as ERC-1155 tokens. Each fragment has dynamic properties (Complexity, Rarity, Influence, Hidden Trait) that can evolve through user interactions like Synthesis, Analysis, and voting. The system is influenced by external "Environmental Factors" provided by an oracle and operates in distinct "Epochs". It includes delegation of voting power and an abstract "Query" mechanism.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Data Fragments:** ERC-1155 tokens (each ID represents a unique type of fragment/concept).
*   **Dynamic Properties:** State variables attached to each fragment ID (Complexity, Rarity, Influence, Hidden Trait, Reveal Status, Last Interaction Time). These change over time or with actions.
*   **Synthesis:** Combining existing fragments to create a new, more complex fragment type.
*   **Analysis:** Unlocking a hidden property of a fragment type, potentially with a cost and cooldown.
*   **Influence Voting:** Users with influence (derived from owned fragments or delegation) can vote to increase or decrease a fragment's overall Influence property.
*   **Delegation:** Users can delegate their Influence voting power to others.
*   **Oracles:** An external oracle provides "Environmental Factors" that affect fragment properties or action outcomes each epoch.
*   **Epochs:** Time periods where environmental factors are constant. Influence might be recalculated at epoch boundaries.
*   **Querying:** An abstract function simulating asking the "archive" a question, the "answer" (a hash or value) depends on the user's owned fragments and their properties.

**Function Categories & Summary:**

1.  **ERC-1155 Standard (7 functions):** Basic required functions for ERC-1155 compliance.
    *   `balanceOf(address account, uint256 id)`: Get balance of fragments of a specific type.
    *   `balanceOfBatch(address[] accounts, uint256[] ids)`: Get balances for multiple accounts and fragment types.
    *   `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Grant/revoke permission to manage all tokens.
    *   `isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator)`: Check if an operator has permission.
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data)`: Safe transfer of single fragment type.
    *   `safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`: Safe transfer of multiple fragment types.
    *   `uri(uint256 id)`: Get the URI for fragment metadata (can be dynamic).

2.  **Fragment Creation & Management (2 functions):**
    *   `mintInitialFragments(address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`: Mint initial fragments (likely owner/admin only).
    *   `synthesizeFragments(uint256[] fragmentIdsToCombine, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`: Combine fragments to create a new fragment type (returns new ID).

3.  **Dynamic Property Getters (6 functions):** Retrieve current properties of a fragment ID.
    *   `getFragmentComplexity(uint256 fragmentId)`
    *   `getFragmentRarity(uint256 fragmentId)`
    *   `getFragmentInfluence(uint256 fragmentId)`
    *   `getFragmentHiddenProperty(uint256 fragmentId)`: Returns value only if revealed.
    *   `isFragmentPropertyRevealed(uint256 fragmentId)`
    *   `getLastInteractionTime(uint256 fragmentId)`

4.  **Core Interactions (5 functions):** Actions users can perform on fragments.
    *   `analyzeFragment(uint256 fragmentId)`: Reveals the hidden property, costs Ether, subject to cooldown.
    *   `delegateVotingPower(address delegatee)`: Delegate your current and future influence.
    *   `castInfluenceVote(uint256 fragmentId, int256 voteAmount)`: Use delegated/owned influence to vote.
    *   `queryArchive(uint256[] ownedFragmentIds, bytes queryData)`: Abstract function simulating a query based on owned fragments.
    *   `getInfluenceVotingPower(address account)`: Get the effective voting power for an account (owned + delegated).

5.  **Epoch & Oracle Management (3 functions):**
    *   `advanceEpoch()`: Moves to the next epoch, recalculates influence based on votes, applies environmental factors.
    *   `updateEnvironmentalFactors(uint256 epoch, bytes32 factorsHash)`: Called by oracle to set factors for a future or current epoch.
    *   `getEpochEnvironmentalFactors(uint256 epoch)`: Get the stored factors for a specific epoch.

6.  **Utility & Admin (at least 7 functions needed to reach 20+ overall, we have 13+ already):**
    *   `getCurrentEpoch()`
    *   `getDelegatee(address account)`
    *   `getTotalVotesForFragment(uint256 fragmentId)`
    *   `getAnalysisCost()`
    *   `getAnalysisCooldownDuration()`
    *   `getSynthesisCooldownDuration()`
    *   `setAnalysisCost(uint256 newCost)`: Owner only.
    *   `setAnalysisCooldownDuration(uint64 newDuration)`: Owner only.
    *   `setSynthesisCooldownDuration(uint64 newDuration)`: Owner only.
    *   `setEpochDuration(uint64 newDuration)`: Owner only.
    *   `setOracleAddress(address newOracleAddress)`: Owner only.
    *   `setBaseURI(string memory newURI)`: Owner only.
    *   `withdrawFees(address payable recipient)`: Owner only.

**Total Functions:** 7 (Standard) + 2 (Creation) + 6 (Property Getters) + 5 (Core Ops) + 3 (Epoch/Oracle) + 13 (Utility/Admin) = **36 functions**. This meets the requirement.
