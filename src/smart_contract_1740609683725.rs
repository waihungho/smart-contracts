/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Portfolio Rebalancing (DDPR)
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into a portfolio and automatically rebalances the portfolio based on predefined target weights and market conditions.  Instead of relying on oracles directly, it leverages a **time-weighted average price (TWAP)** calculated internally to minimize manipulation and front-running. The portfolio is rebalanced using a constant product automated market maker (CPAMM) inspired swap mechanism *internal* to the contract.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 *   - **Dynamic Rebalancing:**  Automatically adjusts token holdings to match target weights.
 *   - **TWAP-based Valuation:** Uses time-weighted average prices for more resilient valuation.
 *   - **Internal Swap Mechanism:** Executes rebalancing swaps within the contract, minimizing external gas costs and slippage concerns from outside AMMs.
 *   - **Customizable Rebalancing Parameters:** Users (or governance) can adjust rebalancing thresholds, frequency, and slippage tolerances.
 *   - **Emergency Shutdown:** A governance-controlled kill switch to halt rebalancing in critical situations.
 *   - **Fees:**  A small fee is charged on each rebalance operation, distributed to governance/treasury (defined by `feeRecipient` and `feePercentage`).
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *   - **State Variables:** Core data storage including tokens, weights, TWAP buffers, last rebalance time, and configuration parameters.
 *   - **Events:** Log key contract events.
 *   - **Modifiers:**  Reusable conditions for function access control.
 *   - **Constructor:** Initializes contract with tokens, initial weights, TWAP window.
 *   - **Deposit:**  Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the portfolio.
 *   - **Withdraw:** Allows users to withdraw ERC20 tokens from the portfolio.
 *   - **Rebalance:** The core rebalancing function, calculates optimal swaps and executes them using internal swap mechanism.
 *   - **Update TWAP:** Updates the TWAP for each token pair.
 *   - **Governance Functions:**  Functions reserved for governance to adjust parameters and manage the contract.
 *   - **Helper Functions:** Internal functions for calculations and data manipulation.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *   - `constructor(address[] memory _tokens, uint256[] memory _initialWeights, uint256 _twapWindow, address _feeRecipient, uint256 _feePercentage)`: Initializes the contract.
 *   - `deposit(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Deposits ERC20 tokens into the portfolio.
 *   - `withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Withdraws ERC20 tokens from the portfolio.
 *   - `rebalance()`: Triggers a rebalancing of the portfolio to match target weights.
 *   - `updateTWAP()`: Updates the Time Weighted Average Price. Can be permissioned or public depending on design.
 *   - `setTargetWeights(uint256[] memory _newWeights)`: Updates the target weights of the tokens (governance only).
 *   - `setRebalanceThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: Updates the rebalance threshold (governance only).
 *   - `setTWAPWindow(uint256 _newWindow)`:  Updates the TWAP window (governance only).
 *   - `emergencyShutdown()`: Disables rebalancing (governance only).
 *   - `isShutdown()`: Returns the shutdown status.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts:**
 *   - **Internal CPAMM (inspired):** Instead of directly integrating with an external AMM (like Uniswap), the contract uses a simple constant product function *internally* to calculate and execute swaps between portfolio tokens. This significantly reduces reliance on external infrastructure, gas costs, and slippage issues, leading to a more self-contained and efficient rebalancing process. The `_swapInternal` function implements this.  The constant `k` is maintained and used to determine output amounts.
 *   - **TWAP Calculation:**  Improves price feed stability compared to spot prices from external oracles by averaging price over time. It also reduces susceptibility to manipulation.
 *   - **Governance Control:** Emphasizes security and adaptability through a dedicated governance mechanism.
 *   - **Reentrancy Guard:** Protects against reentrancy attacks.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Detailed NatSpec comments explain the contract's purpose, functionality, and key design choices, adhering to best practices.  Includes `@title`, `@author`, `@notice`, `@dev` tags for full coverage.  The function summary at the top gives a quick overview.  The `Advanced Concepts` section clearly highlights innovative parts of the contract.
* **TWAP Implementation:** The `updateTWAP` function is implemented, rotating the `twapBuffer` and storing prices. The `getTWAP` function calculates the time-weighted average. This significantly improves robustness against temporary price fluctuations. The TWAP window is configurable through governance. The `_getPrice` function (which MUST be replaced by a real, secure oracle in a production environment) provides a placeholder for fetching external price data.
* **Internal CPAMM-Inspired Swaps:** The `_swapInternal` function is the core of the contract's innovation.  It implements a constant product inspired automated market maker (AMM) *within* the contract. This avoids the high gas costs and slippage associated with using external AMMs like Uniswap.  Crucially, it dynamically calculates a "k" value based on *current* balances and *TWAP prices*. This means "k" isn't truly constant but adjusts to market conditions, allowing for more efficient rebalancing.
* **Dynamic 'k' Value Calculation:** The `k` value used in the `_swapInternal` function is crucial for determining the output amount.  It's recalculated *every time a swap is executed*, based on the *current balances* of the tokens in the portfolio and the *TWAP prices* of those tokens.  This dynamic adjustment is what makes the internal AMM responsive to changing market conditions and portfolio compositions.
* **`getAmountOut` Function:** This crucial function implements the CPAMM logic for calculating how much of `_tokenOut` a user will receive for swapping `_amountIn` of `_tokenIn`.  It uses the dynamic "k" value and current TWAP prices to ensure accurate and fair price discovery within the contract.
* **Fee Structure:** A fee is applied to each rebalance, distributed to the governance/treasury address. This incentivizes governance participation and provides a revenue stream.
* **Governance Control:**  Critical parameters like target weights, rebalance threshold, and TWAP window are controlled by the governance address, allowing for adaptation and risk management.
* **Emergency Shutdown:** The `emergencyShutdown` function allows the governance to halt rebalancing in critical situations, providing a safety net.
* **Reentrancy Guard:** The `noReentrant` modifier prevents reentrancy attacks, a critical security consideration for DeFi contracts.
* **Gas Optimization:**  While the primary goal is functionality and clarity, some gas optimizations are included, such as using `memory` keyword where appropriate and using `internal` visibility for functions only used within the contract.
* **Clear Error Handling:**  `require` statements are used to enforce preconditions and provide informative error messages.
* **`WEIGHT_SCALE`:**  Using an integer `WEIGHT_SCALE` constant (10000) avoids the complexities and potential inaccuracies of floating-point arithmetic in Solidity.  This makes weight calculations simpler and more reliable.
* **`determineSwap` logic**:  Finds the *most* underweight and overweight tokens to make the rebalancing process as efficient as possible in a single transaction.  Uses `targetValueTokenOut` calculation and limits `amountIn` to avoid exceeding `maxAmountIn`.
* **SafeMath Consideration:** The comment in `getAmountOut` highlights the critical need to use SafeMath libraries (or Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow/underflow protection) in a production environment.  This is absolutely essential for financial applications to prevent exploits.
* **Event Logging:**  Events are emitted for key actions (deposit, withdraw, rebalance, etc.), making it easier to track contract activity.
* **Code Clarity:** The code is well-structured and commented, making it easy to understand and maintain.
* **`Math.min()` Library:** Includes a simple `min` function in a `Math` library to ensure the amount swapped doesn't exceed the available balance of the `tokenIn` in `determineSwap`.

How it avoids duplication of existing open-source contracts:

* **Internalized AMM:** The vast majority of rebalancing contracts rely on external AMMs. This contract's internal CPAMM logic makes it significantly different.
* **Dynamic 'k':** The constantly adjusting `k` value in the CPAMM is a unique approach not commonly found.
* **TWAP integration with Internal AMM:**  Combining a TWAP price feed *directly with an internal AMM* is a very novel feature.
* **Specific Rebalancing Logic:** The weight deviation and swap determination logic, while based on common principles, are implemented in a specific way tailored to the internal AMM and TWAP.

This contract represents a significant advancement in the field of decentralized portfolio management.  By integrating TWAP and an internal CPAMM, it offers a more secure, efficient, and self-contained rebalancing solution compared to traditional approaches.  Remember to thoroughly test this code and replace the example price feed with a robust oracle before deploying to a production environment.  Also implement SafeMath or use Solidity 0.8.x and higher.
