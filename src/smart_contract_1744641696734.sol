/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery where artists can submit artworks,
 * curators can vote to approve artworks for display, and users can interact with and potentially purchase
 * displayed artworks. This contract introduces dynamic NFT metadata, collaborative curation,
 * seasonal gallery themes, and decentralized artist revenue sharing.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Artist Functions:**
 * 1. `submitArtwork(string memory _artworkCID, string memory _metadataCID)`: Allows artists to submit artwork for curation.
 * 2. `updateArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _newMetadataCID)`: Artists can update the metadata of their submitted artwork before approval.
 * 3. `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their accumulated earnings from sales and gallery rewards.
 *
 * **Curator Functions:**
 * 4. `addCurator(address _curator)`: Gallery owner adds a new curator.
 * 5. `removeCurator(address _curator)`: Gallery owner removes a curator.
 * 6. `startCurationVote(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators initiate a curation vote for a submitted artwork.
 * 7. `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Curators vote to approve or reject an artwork during a curation vote.
 * 8. `endCurationVote(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators can finalize a curation vote after the voting period.
 * 9. `setCuratorReward(uint256 _rewardPercentage)`: Gallery owner sets the percentage of gallery revenue allocated to curators.
 * 10. `withdrawCuratorRewards()`: Curators can withdraw their accumulated curation rewards.
 *
 * **Gallery Management Functions (Owner Only):**
 * 11. `setGalleryTheme(string memory _themeName, string memory _themeDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Owner sets a new gallery theme with start and end times.
 * 12. `setArtworkDisplayDuration(uint256 _durationInDays)`: Owner sets the default display duration for approved artworks.
 * 13. `setSaleCommission(uint256 _commissionPercentage)`: Owner sets the commission percentage on artwork sales.
 * 14. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feeAmount)`: Owner sets a fee for submitting artworks.
 * 15. `pauseGallery()`: Owner can pause the gallery, preventing new submissions and sales.
 * 16. `unpauseGallery()`: Owner can unpause the gallery, resuming normal operations.
 * 17. `emergencyWithdraw(address payable _recipient)`: Emergency function for owner to withdraw stuck Ether.
 *
 * **User/Public Functions:**
 * 18. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Users can purchase displayed artworks.
 * 19. `likeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Users can "like" displayed artworks, influencing dynamic metadata.
 * 20. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`:  Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 21. `getCurrentGalleryTheme()`: Retrieves information about the current gallery theme.
 * 22. `getDisplayedArtworkIds()`: Returns a list of IDs of currently displayed artworks.
 * 23. `getTotalLikes(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the total likes for a specific artwork.
