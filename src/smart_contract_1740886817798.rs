/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Content Reputation System (DDCRS)
 * @author Bard (An AI Assistant)
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized system for managing and rewarding content creators
 * based on community engagement and a dynamic reputation score.  It leverages a novel decay mechanism for reputation
 * to encourage consistent content creation and community involvement.  It introduces a dynamic reward pool
 * that adjusts to the contract's overall activity and reputation health.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1.  **Content Creation:** Creators can submit content URIs (e.g., IPFS hashes).
 * 2.  **Reputation System:**  Users can vote on content (upvote/downvote).  A content creator's
 *     reputation is calculated based on their content's average score and a time-decaying factor.
 * 3.  **Reputation Decay:**  Reputation decays over time if a creator doesn't create new content or receive engagement.
 * 4.  **Dynamic Reward Pool:** A portion of collected fees are added to a reward pool.  The pool's
 *     distribution is weighted by reputation.  The pool size and distribution frequency are dynamically
 *     adjusted based on the overall contract activity (e.g., content submission rate, vote rate).
 * 5.  **Fee Structure:** Creators and voters might pay a small fee to prevent spam and sustain the system.
 * 6.  **Emergency Shutdown:**  Owner can pause the contract in case of emergency.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - `createContent(string memory _contentURI)`: Allows creators to submit new content.
 *  - `voteContent(uint256 _contentId, bool _upvote)`: Allows users to vote on content.
 *  - `getContentReputation(uint256 _contentId)`: Returns the reputation score for a specific piece of content.
 *  - `getUserReputation(address _user)`: Returns the overall reputation of a user (creator).
 *  - `calculateRewards()`: Calculates and distributes rewards from the reward pool based on user reputation.
 *  - `setFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows the owner to set the fee percentage (in basis points).
 *  - `pause()`: Allows the owner to pause the contract.
 *  - `unpause()`: Allows the owner to unpause the contract.
 *  - `withdraw(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw any excess ether from the contract.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Reward Pool:** The reward pool now dynamically adjusts based on the activity of the contract.  Fees for content creation and voting are added to the pool.
* **Reward Distribution Percentage:** Introduces `rewardDistributionPercentage` which controls how much of the reward pool is distributed during each reward cycle. This allows the contract to build a bigger pool if needed.
* **Minimum Time Between Rewards:** Implements `minTimeBetweenRewards` to prevent frequent small distributions and control the timing of rewards.
* **Reputation Decay:** A `reputationDecayFactor` is introduced and used in both `getContentReputation` and `getUserReputation` to decay reputation over time if there's no recent activity.  This is crucial to prevent reputation hoarding and to encourage ongoing participation.  The decay implementation is time-based.
* **Fee Structure:** Creators and voters pay a small fee. This addresses the "nothing at stake" problem and can help sustain the contract's operation by adding to the reward pool.  This can be adjusted via `setFeePercentage`.  Separate fees for content creation and voting for more fine-grained control.
* **Paused State:** The contract can be paused and unpaused by the owner for emergency maintenance or security issues.
* **Events:** Extensive use of events allows for easy monitoring of contract activity.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `require` statements to ensure that inputs are valid and that the contract is in the correct state.
* **Gas Optimization:** The code has been written to be relatively gas-efficient.  Further optimization could be done by carefully considering data storage and loop usage.
* **Security Considerations:**  This contract, as with *all* smart contracts, needs careful auditing.  Potential vulnerabilities include:
    * **Reentrancy:**  The reward distribution logic could be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Consider using `transfer` (which limits gas) or implementing a check-effects-interactions pattern.  However, the use of `transfer` already mitigates this.
    * **Denial of Service:** A malicious user could spam content or votes to inflate their reputation or to make reward distribution calculations very expensive.  Fees help mitigate this.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** While Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection, be mindful of potential issues if using external libraries or assembly. The use of `int256` in votes to allow for negative reputation addresses the issue directly.
    * **Front Running:**  A malicious user could try to front-run reward distribution by quickly creating content or voting to increase their reputation just before the distribution occurs. Mitigation is difficult but frequent distributions and the reputation decay help.
    * **Owner Control:** The owner has considerable power (pausing, withdrawing).  Consider multi-sig ownership for greater security.
* **Withdrawal Function:** A simple `withdraw` function allows the owner to retrieve funds.
* **Clear Comments:**  Comprehensive comments explain the logic of the code.

To use this contract:

1.  Deploy it to a suitable Ethereum environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat).
2.  Fund the contract with some Ether.
3.  Have users create content, vote on content, and eventually, the contract will distribute rewards to creators based on their reputation.

This is a more advanced and practical example.  Remember that a real-world implementation would require thorough security auditing and testing before being deployed to a live network.  The dynamic reward pool and reputation decay mechanisms are designed to create a more sustainable and engaging content ecosystem.
