/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation & Governance with Dynamic Reward Allocation (DRGRA)
 * @author Gemini AI
 * @notice This smart contract facilitates a decentralized reputation system tied to community governance.
 *         It uses a dynamic reward allocation mechanism based on both reputation and voting participation.
 *         This contract is designed to promote active participation and reward valuable contributions.
 *
 * @dev This contract introduces novel concepts like:
 *      - Reputation Points: Reflecting contribution quality and quantity.
 *      - Dynamic Reward Allocation: Favoring high-reputation, active voters.
 *      - Proposal Types: Allowing for different decision-making processes (simple yes/no, weighted voting).
 *      - Delegated Voting: Enabling users to delegate their voting power.
 *      - Reputation-Based Penalties: Discouraging malicious behavior by docking reputation.
 *      - Quadratic Funding Inspired Matching Pool: Amplifying community contributions.
 *
 *
 * FUNCTION SUMMARY:
 *
 *  // Core Functionality
 *  - registerUser(): Allows a new user to register within the system.
 *  - updateProfile(string _name, string _bio): Updates a user's profile information.
 *  - submitContent(string _contentHash, uint8 _contentType): Submits new content and requests initial reputation points.
 *  - voteOnContent(uint256 _contentId, bool _upvote): Allows users to upvote or downvote content, impacting reputation.
 *  - createProposal(string _title, string _description, ProposalType _proposalType, uint256 _votingDuration, bytes _data): Creates a new governance proposal.
 *  - voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, uint8 _voteChoice, uint256 _weight): Allows users to vote on a governance proposal.
 *  - executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a proposal if it meets the quorum and approval threshold.
 *  - claimRewards(): Allows users to claim their accumulated rewards based on reputation and voting participation.
 *  - donateToMatchingPool(): Allows anyone to donate ETH to the quadratic funding matching pool.
 *  - withdrawMatchingPoolFunds(): Allows the contract owner to withdraw the matching pool funds (subject to governance).
 *  // Reputation Management
 *  - addReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount): Adds reputation points to a user (Admin Only).
 *  - deductReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount, string _reason): Deducts reputation points from a user (Admin Only).
 *  - getContentReputation(uint256 _contentId): Returns the current reputation score of content.
 *  - getUserReputation(address _user): Returns the user's reputation score.
 *
 *  // Governance Parameters (Admin Only)
 *  - setQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum): Sets the minimum quorum required for proposals to pass.
 *  - setApprovalThreshold(uint256 _newApprovalThreshold): Sets the minimum approval percentage required for proposals to pass.
 *  - setRewardMultiplier(uint256 _newRewardMultiplier): Sets the multiplier used to calculate rewards.
 *  - setBaseRewardAmount(uint256 _newBaseRewardAmount): Sets the base reward amount distributed to users.
 *  - setContentReviewer(address _newContentReviewer): Sets the address responsible for content review.
 *  - requestInitialReputation(uint256 _contentId, bool _approved): Content Reviewer approves or rejects initial reputation request.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Complete and Compilable:** This code is now a full, compilable Solidity contract. It includes all the necessary data structures, state variables, events, and functions to implement the DRGRA concept.
* **Error Handling:**  The code now has many `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors. This is crucial for smart contract security and reliability.  Specifically added checks for:
    * Valid content types.
    * Preventing self-voting.
    * Proposal voting constraints (double voting, voting during the voting period, valid vote choice).
    * Requiring enough reputation to deduct.
    * Checking if the content reputation is approved or requested
    * Enforcing ownership and registration restrictions.
* **Clear Modifiers:**  Uses modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `onlyRegisteredUser`, `validProposalId`, etc.) to make the code cleaner and easier to understand.  Reduces code duplication.
* **Events:** Emits events for all significant actions, allowing external applications to monitor the contract's state.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Reentrancy Prevention:**  While this contract doesn't have obvious reentrancy vulnerabilities, it's crucial to consider this in any real-world implementation. If `executeProposal` interacts with external contracts, implement reentrancy guards.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later include automatic overflow/underflow checks, which significantly improve security.  If using an older version, use SafeMath.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Be mindful of potential DoS attacks.  For example, if iterating through a large list of users in a loop, consider pagination to avoid exceeding gas limits.
    * **Access Control:** Clearly defined roles (owner, content reviewer) and access restrictions.
* **Governance Parameters:** Allows the contract owner to adjust crucial parameters like quorum, approval threshold, and reward multipliers.
* **Reputation System:**  A basic reputation system is implemented, where users gain reputation for submitting good content and lose reputation for submitting bad content or receiving downvotes.
* **Reward System:** A dynamic reward system is included, rewarding users based on reputation and voting participation.  The `calculateReward` function is designed to be easily extensible to incorporate more factors.
* **Delegated Voting:** Added a mechanism for users to delegate their voting power to another user. This is important for participation and accessibility.
* **Content Review Process:** An admin (contentReviewer) can grant or reject the initial reputation points for the content
* **Matching Pool (Quadratic Funding Inspired):** Added functionality to donate to a matching pool and for the owner to withdraw those funds (subject to governance, as noted).
* **Proposal Data Field:** The `proposal` struct includes a `bytes data` field. This is CRITICAL for enabling the `executeProposal` function to execute arbitrary code.  The `data` field would typically contain the target contract address and the function signature/encoded parameters to call.  This makes the governance system much more powerful.
* **Proposal Types:** Included proposal types for Simple Majority and Weighted voting.
* **Upvote/Downvote Content:** Added functionality for users to upvote and downvote the content.
* **Comments and Documentation:** Added extensive comments throughout the code to explain the logic and purpose of each function and variable.
* **Total Reputation Counter:** A `totalReputation` state variable tracks the total reputation in the system. This can be used to normalize reputation scores.
* **Correct use of `payable`:** Addressed potential errors and made the withdrawal process correct by using `payable(msg.sender).transfer()`.
* **Content Types:**  Added an enum for `ContentType` to categorize content.
* **Clearer Vote Recording:**  Implemented a `userVotes` mapping within each `Proposal` to prevent double-voting.
* **Loop Protection:** Iterating through the proposal counter should be fine, assuming that it is unlikely to become unfeasibly large for iterating through.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:**
    * Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function arguments where appropriate (e.g., string arguments in external functions).
    * Minimize state variable reads and writes.
    * Use efficient data structures.  Mappings are generally more efficient than arrays for lookups.
* **Testing:**  You will need to write thorough unit tests to verify the correctness and security of this contract.  Use a testing framework like Hardhat or Truffle.

This revised version provides a much more solid foundation for building a decentralized reputation and governance system.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the code before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider security best practices for smart contract development.
