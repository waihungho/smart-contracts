Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and less common concepts, aiming for over 20 functions without directly duplicating popular open-source patterns like standard ERC20/721 implementations, AMMs, or simple vesting contracts.

This contract acts as a "Conditional Agent & Reputation Hub". Users can deposit assets, define complex conditional tasks (actions triggered only when specific, potentially multi-faceted conditions are met), earn reputation based on activity/staking, and delegate specific permissions.

**Smart Contract: ConditionalAgentHub**

**Outline:**

1.  **Introduction:** Contract purpose and core concepts (Conditional Execution, Reputation, Delegation, Programmable Vesting).
2.  **Interfaces:** Define necessary external interfaces (ERC20, simplified Oracle).
3.  **Libraries:** Potentially use Safemath (not strictly needed in modern Solidity for basic arithmetic, but good practice).
4.  **State Variables:** Store user balances, task definitions, conditions, reputation data, staking data, configuration settings, permissions.
5.  **Enums & Structs:** Define types for conditions, tasks, and data structures.
6.  **Events:** Announce significant actions.
7.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state checks (`onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, etc.).
8.  **Core Logic:**
    *   Asset Deposits & Withdrawals (ETH, ERC20).
    *   Task Definition: Allowing users to specify actions (target, data) and attach conditions.
    *   Condition Definition: Supporting various condition types (time, oracle value, contract state, reputation level, ERC20 balance, etc.).
    *   Task Execution: The central function, callable by anyone, that checks *all* conditions for a task and executes the action if met.
    *   Reputation System: Accumulating reputation based on defined rules (e.g., task execution, staking).
    *   ERC20 Staking: A mechanism to earn reputation and/or yield.
    *   Delegation/Permissions: Allowing users to grant limited control (e.g., define tasks for them) to other addresses.
    *   Programmable Release: Functions allowing conditional release of *any* held asset.
9.  **Configuration:** Owner functions to set fees, add supported tokens, update oracle address, etc.
10. **Query Functions:** View functions to inspect contract state, user data, task details, etc.
11. **Safety/Emergency:** Pause/Unpause, Owner withdrawal.

        // or the user pre-approved the agent contract to spend their ERC20s held *externally*.
        // For calls sending ETH, userEthBalances needs to be checked *before* the call.
        // We'll add a basic check for ETH calls where value is included in 'data'. This is simplified.
        // A real system would need more sophisticated parsing or distinct "callWithETH" action types.

        // Check if the call attempts to send ETH (basic check, not foolproof)
        // If target is payable AND data length is 0, it's likely a simple ETH transfer
        // If data is not 0 but includes a value in the function signature/params, more complex logic is needed.
        // Let's assume for now any ETH sent must be explicitly handled by the target contract pulling it
        // OR the 'data' field encodes a value to send (which 'call' handles if target is payable).
        // If task.owner is the one whose funds are being used, agent contract must hold them.

        // Example: A task could be to call a DeFi protocol to swap tokens held *by the Agent contract*.
        // The Agent needs sufficient balance of the input token.
        // If the action is a transfer *from* the task owner's balance *within this contract*,
        // the action logic itself must interact with userEthBalances/userErc20Balances.

        // For a generic 'call', the success/failure is captured.
        // We'll add a simple requirement that the target is payable IF the data indicates a value transfer (difficult to parse generically).
        // A more robust design might have specific `ActionType` enums like `CALL`, `TRANSFER_ETH`, `TRANSFER_ERC20`.
        // Sticking to generic `call` for flexibility, but acknowledging the complexity.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Conditional Execution Engine:** The core concept revolves around the `executeTask` and `checkCondition` functions. Instead of simple timed releases or fixed logic, tasks only run when a dynamic set of on-chain and potentially off-chain (via Oracle) conditions are *all* met.
2.  **Diverse Condition Types:** The `ConditionType` enum and the `checkCondition` logic support a variety of checks:
    *   Time (absolute and relative).
    *   External data via Oracle (e.g., price feeds, events).
    *   Contract State: Reading arbitrary state variables or calling view functions on *other* contracts (`ContractStateValueGE`). This allows complex cross-contract dependencies.
    *   User-centric: Checking ERC20/721/1155 balances *anywhere* or checking the user's internal reputation score.
3.  **Generalized Action (`call`):** The `Action` struct uses a low-level `call` to `target` with arbitrary `data`. This makes the agent highly flexible, capable of interacting with almost any other smart contract function (DeFi protocols, NFTs, DAOs, etc.), provided the `data` is correctly constructed.
4.  **Reputation System:** The contract introduces an internal `userReputation` score. While simple in this example (`_addReputation` and staking-based), this could be extended to award points for successful task executions, participating in governance (if added), or external attestations. Reputation is then usable as a `ConditionType`, enabling access or features only for users above a certain score.
5.  **ERC20 Staking Linked to Reputation:** A trendy DeFi primitive (staking) is integrated not just for yield, but specifically as a mechanism to earn reputation points within the system. The `_updateStakingReputation` function calculates earned reputation based on amount and time staked.
6.  **Programmable Release (`releaseAssetsConditional`):** This function allows users to specify a release of assets (ETH or ERC20) to a beneficiary that only happens if the conditions defined in *other*, separate "condition tasks" are met. This decouples the "what to release" from the "when to release", making complex multi-party or multi-event conditional escrows possible.
7.  **Delegation of Powers:** `grantTaskDefinitionPermission` and `grantConditionalExecutionPermission` allow users to delegate specific abilities (defining tasks for them or triggering task execution) to other addresses. This is more granular than simple ownership transfer.
8.  **Relayer-Friendly Execution:** The `executeTask` function is `public` (anyone can call it). This supports a relayer network model where third parties can monitor conditions and pay the gas to execute tasks on behalf of users, potentially earning a fee (which is also implemented).
9.  **Owner Configuration:** Fees, Oracle address, and supported tokens are owner-configurable, adding a layer of centralized control necessary for bootstrapping, though these could be transitioned to DAO governance.
10. **Comprehensive View Functions:** A wide range of `view` functions allows users and external applications to inspect the state, including complex queries like `queryIsTaskExecutable` which runs the condition checks without state changes.

This contract provides a foundation for building complex, automated behaviors on-chain based on dynamic, multi-faceted conditions and user-earned reputation, going beyond standard token or escrow logic.
