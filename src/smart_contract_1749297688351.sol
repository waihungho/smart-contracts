Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a decentralized fund with a unique, probabilistic allocation mechanism inspired by quantum superposition and collapse, managed through epochs and community input on strategy weights.

This concept is creative as it introduces a non-deterministic (yet weighted) allocation based on on-chain events, advanced by integrating with external strategy contracts, and trendy by touching on fund management and probabilistic systems. It aims to be distinct from typical yield farms or simple investment pools by adding this layer of epoch-based, weighted-random strategy selection.

We'll assume strategies are external contracts implementing a specific interface for depositing, redeeming, and checking balances.

**Outline & Function Summary: QuantumFund Contract**

**Core Concept:**
The QuantumFund contract pools user deposits (Ether) and manages them across different investment "Dimensions". Within each Dimension, multiple external investment strategies can exist. The fund operates in "Epochs". In each epoch, participants propose weights for strategies within dimensions. After a weighting period, the state "collapses" for each dimension, meaning the capital allocated to that dimension for the epoch is probabilistically routed to *one* of its strategies based on the committed weights. Yield is generated by the capital in the chosen strategy and increases the total fund value, thereby increasing the value of each participant's shares.

**Epoch Flow:**
1.  **Collecting:** Users deposit capital. Proposed weights for the *next* epoch can be submitted.
2.  **Weighting:** Deposits for the current epoch close. Only weight proposals/finalization for the *next* epoch are active.
3.  **WeightingComplete:** Weights for the *next* epoch are finalized/committed.
4.  **Collapsed:** The probabilistic collapse for the *current* epoch occurs, allocating capital to strategies. Yield accrual begins in strategies.
5.  (Repeat)

**Key Components:**
*   **Dimensions:** Categories for strategies (e.g., "High Yield", "Stable", "Experimental"). Capital is allocated per dimension per epoch.
*   **Strategies:** External smart contracts implementing `IQuantumStrategy` interface, representing actual investment opportunities (e.g., yield farms, lending protocols, etc.).
*   **Epochs:** Discrete time periods for deposit collection, weight setting, and collapse.
*   **Weights:** Probabilistic distribution defined for strategies within a dimension for the *next* epoch's collapse.
*   **Shares:** Represent user's ownership percentage of the total fund value.

**Function Summary:**

*   **Fund Management:**
    *   `constructor`: Initializes the contract with owner, epoch duration.
    *   `deposit`: Allows users to deposit Ether and receive shares.
    *   `withdraw`: Allows users to redeem shares for Ether based on current fund value.
    *   `getTotalFundValue`: Calculates the total value of assets held by the fund (Ether balance + value in external strategies).
    *   `getInvestorShareValue`: Calculates the value of a specific investor's shares.

*   **Epoch & Collapse Management:**
    *   `startNextEpoch`: Advances the fund to the next epoch, transitioning states and preparing for the next cycle.
    *   `triggerCollapse`: Executes the probabilistic allocation for all eligible dimensions in the *current* epoch based on the committed weights. This is the core "quantum collapse" event.
    *   `getCurrentEpoch`: Returns the current epoch number.
    *   `getEpochState`: Returns the current state of the latest epoch.
    *   `getCollapseOutcome`: Returns which strategy was selected for a specific dimension in a past epoch's collapse.
    *   `getEpochDuration`: Returns the duration of each epoch.
    *   `setEpochDuration`: Allows owner to set the epoch duration.

*   **Strategy & Dimension Management (Owner/Admin):**
    *   `addStrategy`: Adds a new external strategy contract reference.
    *   `removeStrategy`: Removes a strategy reference.
    *   `listStrategies`: Lists all registered strategy addresses.
    *   `getStrategyDetails`: Gets information about a registered strategy.
    *   `addDimension`: Adds a new investment dimension.
    *   `removeDimension`: Removes a dimension.
    *   `listDimensions`: Lists all dimensions.
    *   `assignStrategyToDimension`: Assigns a strategy to a specific dimension.
    *   `removeStrategyFromDimension`: Removes a strategy from a dimension.

*   **Weight & Probability Setting (Owner/Admin or Delegated Role):**
    *   `proposeStrategyWeights`: Submits a probabilistic weighting proposal for strategies within a dimension for the *next* epoch. (Could be extended with voting logic).
    *   `getProposedWeights`: Retrieves the currently proposed weights for the next epoch's collapse for a dimension.
    *   `commitEpochWeights`: Finalizes the proposed weights for the next epoch's collapse, making them active for the subsequent `triggerCollapse`.

*   **Internal/Utility/Admin:**
    *   `checkStrategyBalance`: Queries an external strategy contract to get the fund's balance held there.
    *   `exitStrategyGracefully`: Allows owner to withdraw funds from a specific strategy prematurely in case of issues.
    *   `transferOwnership`: Standard Ownable function to transfer contract ownership.
    *   `pauseContract`: Standard Pausable function to pause critical operations.
    *   `unpauseContract`: Standard Pausable function to unpause the contract.
    *   `setFeeRecipient`: Sets the address to receive collected fees.
    *   `getFeeRecipient`: Gets the fee recipient address.
    *   `setDepositFeeBps`: Sets deposit fee in basis points.
    *   `getDepositFeeBps`: Gets deposit fee in basis points.
    *   `setWithdrawalFeeBps`: Sets withdrawal fee in basis points.
    *   `getWithdrawalFeeBps`: Gets withdrawal fee in basis points.
    *   `collectFees`: Allows fee recipient to withdraw accumulated fees.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Probabilistic Allocation (Quantum Collapse Analogy):** The `triggerCollapse` function simulates a "collapse" where capital is allocated to one strategy within a dimension based on weighted probabilities (`activeWeights`). This is inspired by the concept of quantum superposition collapsing into a definite state upon measurement. On-chain, the "measurement" is triggered by the function call and uses pseudo-randomness to select the state (strategy).
2.  **Epoch-Based Lifecycle:** The fund operates in distinct time-based epochs (`Collecting`, `Weighting`, `WeightingComplete`, `Collapsed`). This structures the investment cycle, separating deposit/withdrawal periods from the allocation process.
3.  **Dynamic Strategy Selection:** Capital isn't permanently tied to one strategy. In each epoch, based on the outcome of the collapse, new capital (collected in that epoch) can be routed to *different* strategies, allowing the fund to adapt over time.
4.  **Community-Influenced Weights:** While simplified to `onlyOwner` in this example for brevity, the `proposeStrategyWeights` and `commitEpochWeights` functions provide hooks for a more decentralized governance mechanism (e.g., a voting system via a separate contract or token) to influence the probabilities of strategy selection for future epochs.
5.  **Modular Strategy Integration:** The use of the `IQuantumStrategy` interface allows the fund to potentially interact with a variety of external DeFi protocols (lending, yield farming, etc.) without needing their specific logic hardcoded into the `QuantumFund` contract itself. The fund acts as a routing layer.
6.  **Share Value Reflecting Total Fund Value:** Investor shares represent a proportion of the *total* value held by the fund, including capital and yield locked in external strategies (queried via `getTotalFundValue` and `checkStrategyBalance`), providing a more accurate reflection of their holdings than just tracking raw ETH deposits.

**Security Considerations & Caveats:**

*   **Randomness:** The use of `block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty` (or `block.prevrandao`), and `msg.sender` for randomness is **highly insecure** for determining significant financial outcomes. Miners/validators can potentially influence these values. A production-ready system *must* integrate with a secure, decentralized oracle for verifiable randomness (like Chainlink VRF).
*   **External Strategy Risk:** The fund is entirely reliant on the security and performance of the external `IQuantumStrategy` contracts. If a strategy contract is hacked, rug-pulled, or fails, the capital allocated to it via this fund will be lost, impacting the `getTotalFundValue` and all investor shares. The `exitStrategyGracefully` is a limited emergency measure.
*   **Strategy Interface Assumptions:** The `IQuantumStrategy` interface is simplified. Real-world integrations might require more complex interactions, handling specific strategy tokens, different yield claiming mechanisms, or approvals (ERC20 allowances) if strategies require them. The `redeem` function's behavior (taking principal amount as input) is an assumption for this example.
*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating through lists of strategies or dimensions in functions like `getTotalFundValue`, `triggerCollapse`, `removeStrategy`, etc., can become expensive as the lists grow. Batching or alternative data structures might be needed for scalability.
*   **Precision Issues:** Division operations can lead to loss of precision. Using libraries or careful ordering of operations (multiplication before division) is important, though `SafeMath` helps with overflow/underflow, not precision loss. Share calculation (`sharesMinted = amountAfterFee.mul(totalShares).div(currentFundValue);`) is a standard way to handle this, but small variations can occur.
*   **Withdrawal Liquidity:** Investors can only withdraw Ether that is currently held in the contract's balance. If most capital is locked in strategies, withdrawals might fail until capital is redeemed from those strategies (either through yield collection or emergency exit). This contract doesn't automatically trigger redemptions from strategies for withdrawals; it assumes sufficient liquid ETH or requires users to wait/rely on admin `exitStrategyGracefully`.

This contract provides a foundation for the "QuantumFund" concept with the requested number of functions and advanced features, while highlighting key areas that would require further development and security hardening for a production environment.
