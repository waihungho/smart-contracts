 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) with advanced features for art management,
 *      community governance, dynamic pricing, artist collaboration, and innovative engagement mechanisms.
 *      It is designed to be creative and trendy, incorporating concepts beyond typical open-source examples.
 *
 * **Contract Outline:**
 *
 * 1.  **Art Proposal & Curation System:**
 *     -  Artists can submit art proposals (NFT references).
 *     -  Community voting on art proposals for gallery inclusion.
 *     -  Curators with special roles to guide curation.
 *
 * 2.  **Dynamic Pricing & Auction Mechanics:**
 *     -  Dynamic pricing algorithm based on community engagement and market trends.
 *     -  Dutch Auction mechanism for initial art piece sales.
 *     -  Secondary market listing and commission system.
 *
 * 3.  **Artist Collaboration & Revenue Sharing:**
 *     -  Collaborative art creation feature with revenue split among artists.
 *     -  Artist royalty system for secondary sales.
 *     -  Artist grants and support mechanisms funded by gallery revenue.
 *
 * 4.  **Community Governance & DAO Features:**
 *     -  Proposal system for gallery upgrades, feature requests, and policy changes.
 *     -  Voting system using governance tokens or NFT ownership.
 *     -  Decentralized decision-making for gallery evolution.
 *
 * 5.  **Interactive Exhibitions & Gamification:**
 *     -  Virtual exhibition spaces managed within the contract.
 *     -  Gamified interactions (e.g., badges, rewards) for gallery engagement.
 *     -  Curated themed exhibitions with specific criteria.
 *
 * 6.  **Advanced Security & Transparency:**
 *     -  Role-based access control for different functions.
 *     -  Transparent data storage and on-chain record keeping.
 *     -  Emergency stop mechanism for critical situations.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Art Management & Curation:**
 *   1. `submitArtProposal(string _ipfsHash, uint256 _editionSize)`: Artists propose new artwork for the gallery.
 *   2. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Community members vote on art proposals.
 *   3. `acceptArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Curators officially accept approved art proposals.
 *   4. `rejectArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Curators reject art proposals.
 *   5. `getArtProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: View details of an art proposal.
 *   6. `listArtProposals(ProposalStatus _status)`: List art proposals based on their status.
 *   7. `getGalleryArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieve information about a specific artwork in the gallery.
 *   8. `listGalleryArtwork(uint256 _start, uint256 _count)`: List artwork currently in the gallery.
 *
 * **Pricing & Sales:**
 *   9. `startDutchAuction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _startingPrice, uint256 _priceDropRate, uint256 _duration)`: Start a Dutch auction for a gallery artwork.
 *  10. `buyArtworkDutchAuction(uint256 _artworkId)`: Purchase artwork during a Dutch auction.
 *  11. `setDynamicPriceAlgorithm(address _algorithmContract)`: Set a contract to handle dynamic pricing calculations.
 *  12. `getArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieve the current dynamic price of an artwork.
 *  13. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: List owned artwork for sale on the secondary market within the gallery.
 *  14. `buyArtworkSecondaryMarket(uint256 _listingId)`: Buy artwork listed on the secondary market.
 *
 * **Artist Collaboration & Revenue:**
 *  15. `createCollaborativeArtworkProposal(string _ipfsHash, address[] _collaborators, uint256[] _shares)`: Propose collaborative artwork with revenue sharing.
 *  16. `acceptCollaborationProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Artists accept collaborative artwork proposals.
 *  17. `claimArtistRevenue(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists claim their revenue from sales.
 *  18. `setSecondarySaleRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Set royalty percentage for artists on secondary sales.
 *
 * **Governance & Community:**
 *  19. `createGovernanceProposal(string _description, bytes _calldata)`: Propose changes to the gallery or contract through governance.
 *  20. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Vote on governance proposals.
 *  21. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Execute approved governance proposals.
 *  22. `setCuratorRole(address _curator, bool _isCurator)`: Assign or remove curator roles.
 *  23. `donateToGallery()`: Allow users to donate to the gallery's operational fund.
 *  24. `withdrawGalleryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Admin function to withdraw funds from the gallery (governance controlled).
 *  25. `emergencyStop()`: Emergency stop function to pause critical contract operations.
