This smart contract, `GeniusNexus`, aims to create a decentralized platform for AI-assisted idea incubation and funding. It integrates several advanced and trendy concepts:

1.  **AI-Assisted Solutions:** A mechanism for users (AI Operatives) to submit solutions, implicitly or explicitly using AI tools, to community-proposed bounties.
2.  **NFTs for Intellectual Assets:** Idea Bounties and AI-Assisted Solutions are represented as ERC721 NFTs, making them ownable, transferable, and providing on-chain provenance.
3.  **Role-Based Staking & Reputation:** Participants stake native tokens (`GNX`) to take on roles (AI Operative, Curator) and earn reputation scores based on their contributions and the success of their actions. Reputation influences rewards and future opportunities.
4.  **Conviction Voting for Funding:** A sophisticated governance mechanism where voting power (conviction) for funding proposals accumulates over time based on the amount of tokens staked. This incentivizes long-term commitment over short-term capital.
5.  **Dynamic Parameter Suggestion:** The contract includes an internal logic that can *suggest* adjustments to system parameters (e.g., reward rates, bond amounts) based on aggregated success metrics of past projects. This moves towards a "self-evolving" DAO model, where the community still has the final say.
6.  **Curator Review & Dispute System:** A peer-review system by bonded Curators, with a mechanism for AI Operatives to dispute unfair reviews.
7.  **Slashing Mechanisms:** Incentivizes good behavior by allowing bonds to be slashed for fraudulent or low-quality submissions.

## Contract: `GeniusNexus`

This contract orchestrates the `GeniusNexus` platform. It relies on a native ERC20 token (`GNX`), and two ERC721 NFT contracts for `Bounties` and `Solutions`.

**Outline & Function Summary:**

### I. Core Infrastructure & Access Control
1.  `constructor`: Initializes core contract dependencies (GNX token, NFT contracts), sets up initial roles for DAO treasurer.
2.  `pause()`: Allows `PAUSER_ROLE` to pause critical contract functions in an emergency.
3.  `unpause()`: Allows `PAUSER_ROLE` to unpause the contract.
4.  `updateDaoTreasurer()`: Allows `DAO_TREASURER_ROLE` to change the treasury address.

### II. Token Management & Staking
5.  `stakeForRole()`: Users stake `GNX` tokens to activate specific roles (e.g., AI Operative, Curator).
6.  `unstakeFromRole()`: Allows users to withdraw staked `GNX` after a cooldown period.
7.  `claimStakingRewards()`: Allows active role participants to claim accrued `GNX` staking rewards.
8.  `distributePeriodicReputationRewards()`: Distributes bonus `GNX` to high-reputation participants periodically, callable by a keeper or DAO.
9.  `treasuryTransfer()`: Enables the `DAO_TREASURER_ROLE` to execute `GNX` transfers for approved funding proposals.

### III. Idea Bounties (ERC721 NFT)
10. `proposeIdeaBounty()`: Creator stakes `GNX` funds and mints a new `BountyNFT` representing their innovation challenge.
11. `cancelIdeaBounty()`: Allows the bounty proposer to cancel an unfunded bounty, potentially with a penalty.
12. `addFundsToBounty()`: Enables anyone to contribute additional `GNX` funds to an existing bounty.
13. `getBountyDetails()`: View function to retrieve comprehensive details of a specific bounty.

### IV. AI-Assisted Solutions (ERC721 NFT)
14. `registerAIOperative()`: Staking `GNX` tokens to become an AI Operative, allowing solution submissions.
15. `submitAIAssistedSolution()`: An `AI_OPERATIVE` submits a solution to a bounty, stakes a bond, and mints a `SolutionNFT`.
16. `withdrawSolutionBond()`: Allows an `AI_OPERATIVE` to reclaim their solution bond if the solution is processed without dispute/slashing.
17. `slashOperativeBond()`: Callable by the DAO to penalize an `AI_OPERATIVE` by slashing their bond for fraudulent or unacceptable solutions.

### V. Curator Review & Evaluation
18. `becomeCurator()`: Staking `GNX` tokens to become a Curator, enabling solution reviews.
19. `reviewSolution()`: `CURATOR` provides a rating and feedback (hashed) on a submitted solution, impacting their reputation.
20. `disputeSolutionReview()`: An `AI_OPERATIVE` can dispute a Curator's review, potentially triggering a DAO vote for arbitration.
21. `getCuratorReputation()`: View function to retrieve the current reputation score of a Curator.

### VI. DAO Governance & Funding (Conviction Voting)
22. `submitFundingProposal()`: A `DAO_MEMBER` proposes to fund a specific solution, setting a voting period and threshold.
23. `voteOnFundingProposal()`: `DAO_MEMBER`s stake `GNX` to cast or update their conviction vote for a proposal, influencing its funding outcome.
24. `executeFundingProposal()`: Executes the funding for a solution once its proposal reaches the required conviction threshold.
25. `submitParameterAdjustmentProposal()`: `DAO_MEMBER`s propose changes to key system parameters, subject to conviction voting.

### VII. Reputation System & Dynamic Adaptation
26. `getReputation()`: Public view function to check any participant's reputation score.
27. `updateReputation()` (internal): Internal function to adjust reputation scores based on actions (successes, failures, reviews).
28. `dynamicParameterSuggestion()`: Callable by anyone (e.g., a keeper), this function calculates and emits *suggested* parameter adjustments based on accumulated success metrics, providing data for `DAO_MEMBER`s to propose via `submitParameterAdjustmentProposal`.
