/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Your Name (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery.
 *      It allows artists to submit artwork, community voting for curation,
 *      NFT minting, exhibition management, decentralized governance via proposals,
 *      artist reputation system, and dynamic pricing based on community engagement.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Data Structures:**
 * - `Artwork`: Struct to store artwork details (ID, artist, title, description, IPFS hash, submissionTime, approvalStatus, saleStatus, price, likes, curatorVotes).
 * - `ArtistProfile`: Struct to store artist profile information (address, name, bio, registrationTime, reputationScore).
 * - `Proposal`: Struct for governance proposals (ID, proposer, proposalType, description, votingStartTime, votingEndTime, votesFor, votesAgainst, executed, executionData).
 *
 * **State Variables:**
 * - `owner`: Contract owner address.
 * - `artworkCount`: Counter for artwork IDs.
 * - `artistCount`: Counter for artist IDs.
 * - `proposalCount`: Counter for proposal IDs.
 * - `artworks`: Mapping of artwork IDs to `Artwork` structs.
 * - `artists`: Mapping of artist addresses to `ArtistProfile` structs.
 * - `proposals`: Mapping of proposal IDs to `Proposal` structs.
 * - `curators`: Mapping of curator addresses to boolean (isCurator).
 * - `minSubmissionDeposit`: Minimum deposit for artwork submission.
 * - `votingDuration`: Duration of voting periods for artworks and proposals.
 * - `approvalThreshold`: Percentage of votes needed for artwork approval.
 * - `likeThresholdForPriceIncrease`: Number of likes to trigger price increase mechanism.
 * - `priceIncreasePercentage`: Percentage by which price increases.
 * - `galleryTreasury`: Address to receive gallery fees and funds.
 * - `galleryFeePercentage`: Percentage of sales going to the gallery.
 * - `paused`: Boolean to pause/unpause contract functionalities.
 *
 * **Modifiers:**
 * - `onlyOwner`: Modifier to restrict function access to the contract owner.
 * - `onlyCurator`: Modifier to restrict function access to curators.
 * - `onlyArtist`: Modifier to restrict function access to registered artists.
 * - `artworkExists`: Modifier to check if an artwork with a given ID exists.
 * - `artistExists`: Modifier to check if an artist profile exists.
 * - `proposalExists`: Modifier to check if a proposal with a given ID exists.
 * - `notPaused`: Modifier to prevent function execution when the contract is paused.
 * - `votingPeriodNotEnded`: Modifier to ensure voting period has not ended.
 *

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Curation via Community Voting:**  Instead of centralized curators, the contract implements a voting system where curators (initially set by the owner, but could be expanded to a wider community or DAO in future iterations) vote on submitted artworks. This reflects a trend towards decentralized governance and community involvement.

2.  **Dynamic Pricing based on Community Engagement (Likes):** The `likeArtwork` function introduces a novel concept where the price of an artwork can dynamically increase based on the number of "likes" it receives from the community. This creates a self-adjusting pricing mechanism influenced by popularity, moving beyond fixed prices.

3.  **Governance Proposals and Execution:** The contract includes a basic governance system using proposals. Curators can create proposals to change key parameters of the gallery (like fees, voting durations, etc.).  While simple in this example, it demonstrates the foundation for a more complex Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) structure. The `CUSTOM_FUNCTION` proposal type is a placeholder for extending governance to more complex actions in the future.

4.  **Artist Reputation (Placeholder):** The `ArtistProfile` struct includes a `reputationScore` field.  While not fully implemented, this hints at the potential to build a reputation system for artists based on community feedback, sales, or other metrics. This could unlock future features like tiered artist benefits or curated collections.

5.  **Submission Deposit:** Requiring a small deposit for artwork submissions (`minSubmissionDeposit`) can deter spam and incentivize artists to submit quality work. This mechanism can be adjusted via governance proposals.

6.  **Gallery Treasury and Fees:** The contract manages a `galleryTreasury` and collects a percentage of sales (`galleryFeePercentage`).  These funds can be used for the upkeep of the gallery, community rewards, or further development, guided by governance proposals.

7.  **Pause/Unpause Functionality:** The `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` functions provide an emergency brake mechanism. In case of a critical vulnerability or unexpected issue, the owner can pause the contract to prevent further actions while a solution is implemented.

8.  **Clear Separation of Roles (Artist, Curator, Community):** The contract clearly defines roles and access control using modifiers (`onlyArtist`, `onlyCurator`, `onlyOwner`). This modular design makes the contract more secure and understandable.

9.  **NFT Minting Integration (Conceptual):** The `mintArtworkNFT` function is a placeholder for integration with an actual NFT contract. The concept is that after artwork approval, the artist would use this function to trigger the minting of a unique NFT representing their digital artwork.

10. **Comprehensive Function Set (30+ Functions):** The contract exceeds the 20+ function requirement, offering a wide range of functionalities from artist registration and artwork submission to governance and utility functions.

**Important Considerations and Future Enhancements:**

*   **NFT Contract Integration:**  The `mintArtworkNFT` function needs to be connected to a real NFT contract (e.g., ERC721 or ERC1155) to create actual NFTs.
*   **Voting Mechanism Improvements:**  The voting system could be made more robust (e.g., quadratic voting, weighted voting based on token holdings if a gallery token is introduced).
*   **Curator Selection and Rotation:**  A more sophisticated curator selection and rotation mechanism could be implemented, potentially governed by the community.
*   **Advanced Governance:** The governance system could be expanded to include more complex proposal types, delegation, and potentially a dedicated DAO token.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract could be optimized for gas efficiency, especially if deployed on a mainnet.
*   **Frontend UI:** A user-friendly frontend interface would be essential for artists, curators, and users to interact with the gallery.
*   **Security Audit:**  Before deploying to a production environment, a thorough security audit is crucial to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
*   **IPFS Integration:**  While IPFS hash storage is included, actual retrieval and display of artwork from IPFS would require frontend integration and potentially IPFS gateway services.
*   **Artist Reputation System Implementation:**  The `reputationScore` field in `ArtistProfile` could be developed into a functional reputation system with clear metrics and benefits for artists.

This Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery smart contract provides a foundation for a creative and advanced blockchain application, incorporating several trendy concepts and offering a rich set of functionalities beyond basic token transfers or simple marketplaces. Remember that this is an example, and real-world deployment would require further development, testing, and security considerations.
