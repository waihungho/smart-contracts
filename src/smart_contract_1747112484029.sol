Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that goes beyond simple tokens or standard DAO structures. We'll create a "Decentralized Collaborative Project Hub" contract. Each instance of this contract will represent a single project, allowing a defined group of contributors to manage resources, achieve milestones, build reputation, and make decisions on-chain.

It combines elements of:
1.  **Resource Management:** Staking, treasury functions.
2.  **Reputation System:** Earned/lost based on actions, impacts governance weight.
3.  **Milestone Tracking:** Defining and completing project goals.
4.  **Proposal & Voting:** Decentralized decision-making weighted by reputation.
5.  **State Machine:** Project progresses through different states.

This is not a standard ERC-20, ERC-721, basic multisig, or typical Uniswap/Aave-style DeFi primitive. It's a framework for on-chain group coordination on specific goals.

## DecentralizedProjectHub Smart Contract

**Concept:** A smart contract acting as an on-chain hub for a single collaborative project. It manages contributors, resources, milestones, reputation, and decision-making via reputation-weighted proposals and voting.

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Define project parameters, contributor data, milestones, proposals, treasury, etc.
2.  **Enums:** Define project states, proposal types, proposal statuses.
3.  **Structs:** Define Milestone and Proposal structures.
4.  **Events:** Announce key actions and state changes.
5.  **Modifiers:** Control access and project state.
6.  **Core Logic:**
    *   Constructor: Initialize project details and owner.
    *   Admin/Setup Functions: Set project details, add/remove approved resource tokens, manage contributors initially.
    *   Contributor Management: Functions to add/remove contributors (post-setup, likely via proposals).
    *   Resource & Treasury: Staking resources, checking balances, proposing resource use.
    *   Milestones: Adding milestones, proposing completion, marking completed.
    *   Reputation: Awarding/penalizing reputation (primarily via proposal execution).
    *   Proposals & Voting: Creating different types of proposals, voting (reputation-weighted), checking status, executing approved proposals.
    *   State Control: Pause/Unpause project.
7.  **View/Getter Functions:** Retrieve state variable values and struct details.

**Function Summary (At least 20 functions):**

*   `constructor(string _projectName, string _projectDescription, address[] _initialContributors)`: Initializes the project with basic details and initial team.
*   `setProjectDetails(string _newName, string _newDescription)`: Owner updates project name/description.
*   `addApprovedResourceToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Owner adds an ERC20 token that can be staked or held in the treasury.
*   `removeApprovedResourceToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Owner removes an approved token (only if treasury balance is zero).
*   `addContributor(address _contributor)`: Adds an address as a contributor (can be called by owner initially, or via approved proposal later).
*   `removeContributor(address _contributor)`: Removes a contributor (via approved proposal).
*   `stakeResource(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Contributors stake approved ERC20 tokens into the project treasury. Requires prior approval (`ERC20.approve`).
*   `withdrawStake(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Contributors withdraw their staked resources (may be conditional based on project state or milestones).
*   `addMilestone(string _description, uint256 _deadlineTimestamp, uint256 _requiredReputationToComplete, uint256 _reputationReward)`: Owner adds a new project milestone.
*   `proposeMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _milestoneId)`: A contributor proposes a specific milestone has been met, initiating a vote.
*   `createProposal(string _description, ProposalType _type, bytes _executionDetails, uint256 _votingPeriodSeconds)`: Contributors with sufficient reputation can create a proposal for various actions (resource allocation, parameter change, contributor changes, reputation award/penalty).
*   `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Contributors cast a vote (For/Against) on a proposal. Voting power is weighted by their current reputation.
*   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Any contributor can call this after the voting period ends if the proposal passed. Executes the proposed action.
*   `awardReputation(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Internal function, only callable via `executeProposal` with a ProposalType.ReputationAward.
*   `penalizeReputation(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Internal function, only callable via `executeProposal` with a ProposalType.ReputationPenalty.
*   `pauseProject()`: Owner can pause project activity (staking, proposals, etc.).
*   `unpauseProject()`: Owner can unpause the project.
*   `getContributorReputation(address _contributor)`: View function to get a contributor's current reputation points.
*   `getProjectTreasuryBalance(address _tokenAddress)`: View function to get the project's balance for an approved token.
*   `getMilestoneDetails(uint256 _milestoneId)`: View function to get details of a milestone.
*   `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to get details of a proposal.
*   `isContributor(address _account)`: View function to check if an address is a contributor.
*   `getApprovedResourceTokensList()`: View function to list approved token addresses.
*   `getProjectState()`: View function to get the current state of the project.
*   `getProposalVoteCount(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to get current raw votes for/against.
*   `getProposalReputationWeight(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to get current reputation-weighted votes for/against.
*   `hasVotedOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, address _account)`: View function to check if an account has already voted on a proposal.

**Explanation of Concepts & Advanced Features:**

1.  **State Machine (`ProjectState`):** The project moves through different stages (Active, Paused, Completed, Failed), controlling which actions are permissible.
2.  **Reputation System:** Contributor actions (like proposing milestone completion) and potentially proposals themselves can award/penalize reputation points. This is an *internal* score for governance, not a transferrable token.
3.  **Reputation-Weighted Voting:** Voting power isn't 1 person = 1 vote or 1 token = 1 vote. It's based on the contributor's accumulated reputation in *this specific project*. This incentivizes positive contributions over time. The `determineProposalOutcome` (or `determineProposalOutcomeSimple`) function implements this logic, considering both a majority percentage and a quorum (minimum participation).
4.  **Structured Proposals (`ProposalType`, `executionDetails`):** Proposals are not just text. They have a defined `ProposalType` and carry encoded data (`executionDetails`) that the contract uses to call specific internal functions (`_executeResourceAllocation`, `executeMilestoneCompletion`, etc.) if the proposal passes. This makes the governance system capable of enacting concrete changes to the contract's state and assets.
5.  **Milestone Tracking:** Formal on-chain representation of project goals with deadlines and associated rewards (here, reputation rewards). Completion requires a proposal and vote.
6.  **Resource Treasury & Staking:** The contract can hold approved ERC20 tokens. Contributors can stake resources (showing commitment), and the project can allocate these resources via approved proposals. Staked resources might potentially be tied to project outcomes (not fully implemented here but possible).
7.  **Internal/External Function Calls:** Using internal helper functions (`_executeResourceAllocation`, `_awardReputationInternal`, etc.) called only by the `executeProposal` function provides a clear separation of concerns and ensures complex actions are only taken after the governance process approves them.
8.  **`bytes executionDetails`:** Using `bytes` and `abi.decode` allows proposals to carry arbitrary data needed for execution, making the proposal system extensible to new types of actions without changing the core `Proposal` struct.
9.  **Non-Standard Logic:** Unlike standard token contracts or simple DAOs, this contract defines unique logic for contribution tracking, reputation accrual based on milestone/proposal success, and resource management tailored to a collaborative project's lifecycle.

**Limitations and Potential Improvements (as this is a concept):**

*   **Total Active Reputation Tracking:** The example `getTotalActiveReputation` function is a placeholder. A real implementation needs a state variable updated every time reputation changes or contributors are added/removed for an accurate quorum calculation.
*   **Efficient Contributor/Token Listing:** Iterating mappings (`getApprovedResourceTokensList`, `getTotalActiveReputation` example) can be gas-intensive. For production, tracking these in dynamic arrays or linked lists is better, but requires more complex add/remove logic.
*   **Proposal Execution Security:** The `executeProposal` function must be extremely careful in how it decodes and calls based on `executionDetails`. A bug here could be critical. More complex actions might require a separate, specialized executor contract called by the hub.
*   **Error Handling in Execution:** The current `executeProposal` marks rejected on *any* execution failure. Finer-grained error handling might be needed.
*   **Milestone Dependencies:** Milestones could have dependencies (Milestone B requires Milestone A).
*   **Dispute Resolution:** No mechanism for resolving disputes or challenging proposal outcomes outside of the voting process.
*   **Upgradability:** The contract is not upgradable, which might be desired for a long-term project hub.
*   **Gas Costs:** Complex state changes (like iterating contributors or managing dynamic arrays) can be costly.

This contract serves as an example of combining several blockchain concepts into a novel application for on-chain project coordination, fulfilling the requirements for interesting, advanced, and non-standard functionality.
