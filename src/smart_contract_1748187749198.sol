Okay, let's create a smart contract that combines several interesting concepts: a decentralized vault for user deposits, a mechanism for users to participate in prediction markets *using* their staked funds, a basic reputation system based on prediction success, and allocation to simulated internal strategies, all managed with roles and fees.

This isn't a direct copy of standard DeFi protocols, prediction markets, or vaults. It attempts to combine elements of staking, prediction, internal fund allocation, and reputation building within a single contract.

**Concept:** **AstroOracleVault - Decentralized Prediction & Strategy Vault**

Users deposit funds into a vault. They can then use their staked balance to participate in prediction events (e.g., "Will ETH price be > $3000 on date X?"). Successful predictions increase their balance and reputation score. Users can also allocate a percentage of their staked balance to predefined, simulated internal strategies. The contract collects a fee on prediction winnings and potentially strategy gains. Reputation score could unlock future features or benefits.

**Outline & Function Summary**

**I. Contract Structure:**
    - Imports (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard - good practice)
    - State Variables (Owner, Oracle, Fees, Balances, Predictions, Strategies, Reputation Scores)
    - Enums (PredictionStatus, ProtocolStatus)
    - Structs (PredictionEvent, StrategyAllocation)
    - Events (Deposit, Withdraw, PredictionCreated, BetPlaced, PredictionResolved, WinningsClaimed, StrategyAllocated, ScoreUpdated, FeeCollected, ProtocolStatusUpdated, etc.)
    - Modifiers (onlyOwner, whenNotPaused, whenPredictionActive, whenPredictionResolvable, etc.)
    - Constructor
    - Fallback/Receive

**II. Core Vault Functions:**
    1.  `deposit()`: Allows users to deposit ETH into the vault. Updates user balance and total staked.
    2.  `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw ETH from their available balance. Checks for sufficient balance.
    3.  `getUserBalance(address user)`: Returns the total balance a user has in the vault (staked + claimable winnings).
    4.  `getTotalStaked()`: Returns the total collective ETH staked in the vault.
    5.  `getVaultETHBalance()`: Returns the actual ETH balance held by the contract.

**III. Prediction Market Functions:**
    6.  `createPredictionEvent()`: (Admin/Authorized) Creates a new prediction event with question, outcomes, oracle source, and resolution time.
    7.  `placePredictionBet()`: (User) Allows a user to place a bet on a specific outcome of an active prediction event using their staked balance. Transfers funds within the contract to the prediction pool.
    8.  `resolvePredictionEvent()`: (Admin/Oracle Trigger) Resolves a prediction event based on the outcome provided by the oracle. Calculates winnings for participants of the winning outcome.
    9.  `claimPredictionWinnings()`: (User) Allows a user to claim their calculated winnings from a resolved prediction event. Moves winnings to their main balance.
    10. `getPredictionEventDetails(uint256 eventId)`: Returns details about a specific prediction event.
    11. `getUserPredictionBet(uint256 eventId, address user)`: Returns the user's bet details for a specific event.
    12. `getPredictionEventStatus(uint256 eventId)`: Returns the current status of a prediction event.
    13. `getOutcomePoolSize(uint256 eventId, uint256 outcomeId)`: Returns the total staked amount for a specific outcome in an event.
    14. `cancelPredictionEvent(uint256 eventId)`: (Admin/Authorized) Cancels an active prediction event and refunds staked amounts.

**IV. Strategy Allocation Functions (Simulated):**
    15. `allocateToStrategy()`: (User) Allocates a percentage of the user's staked balance to a predefined internal strategy ID.
    16. `deallocateFromStrategy()`: (User) Deallocates funds from a strategy back to the user's main staked balance.
    17. `getUserStrategyAllocation(address user, uint256 strategyId)`: Returns the amount a user has allocated to a specific strategy.
    18. `executeStrategyPayout(uint256 strategyId, int256 payoutRatio)`: (Admin/Authorized) Simulates a payout (positive or negative) for a strategy, adjusting user balances allocated to it. Updates strategy performance metric.

**V. Reputation & Scoring Functions:**
    19. `getUserPredictionScore(address user)`: Returns the user's score based on successful predictions.
    20. `getUserStrategyScore(address user)`: Returns the user's score based on strategy performance.
    21. `getTotalReputationScore(address user)`: Returns the user's combined prediction and strategy score.
    22. `canAccessPremiumFeature(address user)`: Checks if a user's total reputation score meets a threshold for a hypothetical premium feature.

**VI. Protocol & Admin Functions:**
    23. `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: (Owner) Sets the address of the trusted oracle contract (mock or real).
    24. `setFeePercentage(uint256 _feePercentage)`: (Owner) Sets the percentage fee taken from prediction winnings/strategy gains.
    25. `collectProtocolFees()`: (Owner) Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated protocol fees.
    26. `addAuthorizedPredictionCreator(address creator)`: (Owner) Adds an address authorized to create prediction events.
    27. `removeAuthorizedPredictionCreator(address creator)`: (Owner) Removes an authorized prediction creator.
    28. `emergencyShutdown()`: (Owner) Pauses most user interactions (deposits, bets, allocations, payouts). Allows withdrawals.
    29. `reactivateProtocol()`: (Owner) Reverts from emergency shutdown state.
    30. `getProtocolFeesCollected()`: Returns the total fees accumulated by the protocol.
    31. `setStrategyPerformanceThreshold(uint256 strategyId, int256 threshold)`: (Admin/Authorized) Sets a performance threshold for a strategy (e.g., for scoring). (Added for strategy scoring logic)
    32. `setReputationThreshold(uint256 threshold)`: (Owner) Sets the minimum reputation score required for premium features. (Added for `canAccessPremiumFeature`)
    33. `updateStrategyDefinition(uint256 strategyId, string memory description)`: (Admin/Authorized) Allows updating strategy description or parameters (simple for now). (Added for clarity)
    34. `getStrategyDescription(uint256 strategyId)`: Returns the description of a strategy. (Added for clarity)

Total functions: 34 (Well over the required 20)

         // Let's simplify further: This function only updates a global performance metric for the strategy
         // and affects the *score* of anyone *currently allocated* to it. The balance changes would happen via
         // deallocation (where the user gets back the *current* value of their allocation).

        // Let's refine `executeStrategyPayout`: it updates the user's *strategy score* based on the payout ratio
        // for users who are currently allocated to this strategy. It does *not* change their balances directly.
        // Balance changes from strategy performance only happen when `deallocateFromStrategy` is called,
        // and the amount returned is the *current value* of the allocation, which must be tracked.

        // --- Revision: Strategy Allocation Value Tracking ---
        // Need to track the current *value* of a user's allocation in a strategy, not just the initial amount.
        // This is complex, requiring a share/unit system like yield farming.
        // `userStrategyAllocations[user][strategyId].allocatedAmount` should probably be `units`.
        // Total units in strategy * price per unit = total value.
        // PayoutRatio updates the price per unit.
        // Deallocate returns units * current price per unit.

        // --- Let's use a simplified model for this example contract ---
        // `userStrategyAllocations[user][strategyId].allocatedAmount` is the *initial* staked amount.
        // We add a mapping `strategyCurrentValue[strategyId]`
        // `executeStrategyPayout` updates `strategyCurrentValue[strategyId]` based on `payoutRatio`.
        // `deallocateFromStrategy` calculates the final return based on the *initial* allocation and the *final* `strategyCurrentValue`.
        // This is NOT a standard or robust way to do it, but serves as a simulation for function count.

        // mapping(uint256 => int256) private strategyPerformanceIndicator; // Cumulative performance or current value factor? Let's use value factor. 1e18 represents 100%.
        // Initialise in defineStrategy? Or just default 1e18? Let's initialize to 1e18 when first used/defined.

        // Update strategy performance indicator:
        // Example: if indicator is 1e18 (100%) and payoutRatio is 105, new indicator is (1e18 * 105) / 100.
        // If it's 95, new indicator is (1e18 * 95) / 100.

        // This requires knowing the current indicator. Let's make it a mapping: `mapping(uint256 => uint256) public strategyValueIndicator; // Using uint for simplicity, 1e18 = 100%`
        // Initialize to 1e18 when first used/defined.

        // In executeStrategyPayout(strategyId, payoutRatio):
        // uint256 currentIndicator = strategyValueIndicator[strategyId];
        // if (currentIndicator == 0) currentIndicator = 1e18; // Initialize if first payout

        // uint256 newIndicator = (currentIndicator * uint256(payoutRatio)) / 100; // Use uint256(payoutRatio) assumes payoutRatio is always treated as positive multiplier percentage
        // This doesn't handle negative payouts correctly. Need signed integer math.
        // Revert to `int256 strategyPerformanceIndicator`. Initialize to 0? 1e18?
        // Let's use a simple score change simulation instead of balance changes via this function.

        // Final simplified approach for executeStrategyPayout:
        // It takes a `scoreChange` parameter and adds it to the score of ALL users *currently allocated* to that strategy.
        // This still requires iteration... Let's add the list of users to the parameters, acknowledging this limitation.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Integrated Vault & Prediction/Strategy Participation:** Unlike separate prediction markets or staking pools, this contract allows users to stake funds in a central vault and then use *that staked balance* to participate in predictions or allocate to strategies *without transferring funds out*. This creates a unified risk/reward profile tied to the vault balance.
2.  **Internal Strategy Simulation:** The `executeStrategyPayout` function (though simplified to a score update in the final code due to iteration limitations) and `allocateToStrategy` hint at a model where the protocol could offer internal, potentially algorithmic, investment strategies. Users allocate to these strategies from their vault balance, and the protocol (or authorized managers/logic) executes steps that affect the value of these allocations (or their associated scores). This is a simplified form of on-chain fund management.
3.  **Reputation System:** The contract tracks prediction and strategy scores (`userPredictionScores`, `userStrategyScores`). This on-chain reputation can be combined (`getTotalReputationScore`) and used to gate access to features (`canAccessPremiumFeature`), potentially rewarding successful participants with lower fees, higher allocation limits, or governance rights in a more complex version. This adds a persistent identity/performance layer beyond just token balances.
4.  **Flexible Fee Structure:** The protocol can dynamically set a fee percentage (`setFeePercentage`) on prediction winnings and (conceptually) strategy gains, creating a revenue stream for the protocol or its stakeholders.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control for Key Actions:** Beyond just `Ownable`, the contract introduces roles like `authorizedPredictionCreators` and `authorizedStrategyManagers`. This allows distributing specific permissions (creating predictions, simulating strategy performance) to multiple trusted parties or even smart contracts, moving away from a single point of control for operational tasks.
6.  **Emergency Shutdown Mechanism:** Includes a `emergencyShutdown` function to pause risky operations (like new deposits, bets, allocations) while still allowing users to withdraw their current balances, enhancing safety in case of bugs or market crises.
7.  **Internal Fund Movement:** Betting (`placePredictionBet`) doesn't send funds to a separate contract; it updates internal mappings (`userBalances`, `predictionEvents[eventId].outcomePools`), which is gas-efficient for internal state changes.
8.  **Simulation Placeholders:** Functions like `executeStrategyPayout` and parts of `claimPredictionWinnings`/`cancelPredictionEvent` contain explicit notes about the limitations of iterating over mappings in Solidity and suggest alternative design patterns (like providing user lists as parameters or using helper contracts/off-chain processes) that are common in more complex dApps bridging on-chain and off-chain logic. This acknowledges real-world implementation challenges.

This contract attempts to build a more integrated system than simple, isolated components, combining multiple user activities (staking, betting, strategy allocation) with a persistent reputation layer and flexible protocol controls. While some complex parts (like strategy execution logic affecting balances or efficient iteration) are simplified or noted as requiring off-chain/hybrid solutions, the structure and function set demonstrate a creative approach to building a multifaceted DeFi/Prediction protocol.
