Okay, let's design a smart contract based on a creative concept that's a bit different from standard patterns.

We'll create a "Quantum Entangled Treasury" (QET). This contract will manage user deposits in two conceptual "dimensions" or "states": Alpha and Beta. The core idea is that withdrawing assets from the Beta dimension is conditionally linked to the user's balance and actions in the Alpha dimension, mimicking a form of "entanglement" and "observation" that influences state collapse and accessibility.

It's an abstract concept, not real quantum physics, but it allows for interesting state-dependent logic.

**Concept:** Quantum Entangled Treasury (QET)

*   **Core Idea:** Manage user funds (ETH and ERC-20) in two distinct "dimensions" (Alpha and Beta). Withdrawal from Beta is conditional on maintaining specific balances/states in Alpha and triggering an "Observation" event.
*   **Entanglement:** A user can "entangle" their Alpha and Beta positions, linking their states for conditional access. Requires minimum deposits in both.
*   **Observation:** A user action that momentarily "collapses" the uncertainty and allows for entangled withdrawals from Beta, provided the Alpha conditions are met *at the time of observation*. This window is time-limited.
*   **Decoherence (Implicit):** If Alpha conditions aren't met during the observation window, or if the window expires, entangled withdrawal from Beta becomes impossible until a new observation is triggered (if allowed).
*   **State:** The contract tracks balances per user per dimension, pairing status, and observation state.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

**Contract:** `QuantumEntangledTreasury`

**Core Concepts:**
*   Two dimensions for funds: Alpha and Beta.
*   Conditional withdrawal from Beta based on Alpha balance/state.
*   User-initiated "pairing" and "observation" mechanics.
*   Support for ETH and multiple ERC-20 tokens.
*   Owner/Governance controlled parameters.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Contract owner (governance).
*   `supportedTokens`: Set of allowed ERC-20 tokens.
*   `alphaBalances`: Mapping `user => token => amount`.
*   `betaBalances`: Mapping `user => token => amount`.
*   `ethAlphaBalances`: Mapping `user => amount`.
*   `ethBetaBalances`: Mapping `user => amount`.
*   `isPaired`: Mapping `user => bool`. True if user's Alpha/Beta are paired.
*   `pairingTimestamp`: Mapping `user => uint256`. Timestamp of pairing.
*   `observationTriggeredTimestamp`: Mapping `user => uint256`. Timestamp observation was last triggered.
*   `observationWindowDuration`: Duration (in seconds) of the observation window after triggering.
*   `entanglementThresholds`: Mapping `token => struct { uint256 minAlpha; uint256 minBeta; }`. Min required balances for pairing/entangled withdrawal.

**Functions:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes owner and sets initial observation window duration.
2.  `addSupportedToken(address token)`: Owner adds an ERC-20 token to the supported list.
3.  `removeSupportedToken(address token)`: Owner removes an ERC-20 token from the supported list.
4.  `setObservationWindowDuration(uint256 duration)`: Owner sets the duration of the observation window.
5.  `setEntanglementThreshold(address token, uint256 minAlpha, uint256 minBeta)`: Owner sets required min balances for pairing/entangled withdrawal for a specific token.
6.  `depositEthAlpha()`: User deposits ETH into their Alpha balance.
7.  `depositEthBeta()`: User deposits ETH into their Beta balance.
8.  `depositTokenAlpha(address token, uint256 amount)`: User deposits ERC-20 into their Alpha balance. Requires token approval.
9.  `depositTokenBeta(address token, uint256 amount)`: User deposits ERC-20 into their Beta balance. Requires token approval.
10. `withdrawEthAlpha(uint256 amount)`: User withdraws ETH from their Alpha balance. Standard withdrawal.
11. `withdrawTokenAlpha(address token, uint256 amount)`: User withdraws ERC-20 from their Alpha balance. Standard withdrawal.
12. `withdrawEthBetaEntangled(uint256 amount)`: User withdraws ETH from their Beta balance. **Requires pairing, active observation window, and meeting Alpha ETH threshold.**
13. `withdrawTokenBetaEntangled(address token, uint256 amount)`: User withdraws ERC-20 from their Beta balance. **Requires pairing, active observation window, and meeting Alpha token threshold.**
14. `pairMyDeposits()`: User attempts to pair their Alpha and Beta positions. Requires meeting minimum thresholds for *all* supported tokens and ETH in *both* dimensions *at the time of pairing*. Sets `isPaired` to true and records timestamp.
15. `unpairMyDeposits()`: User unpairs their deposits. Breaks the entanglement link.
16. `triggerObservation()`: User triggers an "observation". Can only be called if paired. Sets `observationTriggeredTimestamp`, opening the limited withdrawal window for Beta.
17. `getAlphaBalance(address user, address token)`: View user's balance of a specific ERC-20 token in Alpha.
18. `getBetaBalance(address user, address token)`: View user's balance of a specific ERC-20 token in Beta.
19. `getEthAlphaBalance(address user)`: View user's ETH balance in Alpha.
20. `getEthBetaBalance(address user)`: View user's ETH balance in Beta.
21. `isUserPaired(address user)`: View if a user's deposits are currently paired.
22. `getPairingTime(address user)`: View the timestamp when a user last paired their deposits.
23. `getObservationExpiry(address user)`: View the timestamp when a user's current observation window expires (0 if not triggered).
24. `checkEntanglementCondition(address user, address token)`: View if a user *currently* meets the Alpha balance threshold required for entangled withdrawal of a specific token/ETH. (For ETH, use address(0)).
25. `getEntanglementThreshold(address token)`: View the required minAlpha and minBeta amounts for a specific token/ETH.
26. `transferEntanglement(address recipient)`: User transfers their *paired state and balances* in *both* dimensions to another user. Requires both sender and recipient consent/interaction outside the contract (conceptually, not enforced here for simplicity). This function itself just does the transfer *if* the user owns the paired state. (Simplified: transfers sender's entire QET position).
27. `emergencyWithdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount)`: Owner function to withdraw a specific amount of a token (could be used for rescues).
28. `emergencyWithdrawEth(uint256 amount)`: Owner function to withdraw a specific amount of ETH.
29. `renounceOwnership()`: Owner renounces ownership.
30. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Owner transfers ownership.

**Explanation of Concepts and Code:**

1.  **Dimensions (Alpha/Beta):** Represented by separate mappings (`alphaBalances`, `betaBalances`, `ethAlphaBalances`, `ethBetaBalances`). Funds are segregated based on which deposit function is called.
2.  **Entanglement:** The `pairMyDeposits()` function. It's a user-initiated action. The requirement to meet thresholds in *both* dimensions simultaneously for *all* assets with set thresholds is the "entanglement" link. If you don't meet the requirement in one dimension, you can't pair, thus you can't unlock the special Beta withdrawal.
3.  **Observation:** The `triggerObservation()` function. This is a state-changing action that opens a time-limited window (`observationWindowDuration`). This window is the "observed state" where the conditional Beta withdrawal logic becomes active. It's a key mechanism to gate access.
4.  **Conditional Beta Withdrawal:** The `withdrawEthBetaEntangled` and `withdrawTokenBetaEntangled` functions are the core of the "entanglement" effect. They *specifically* check three things:
    *   Is the user paired (`isPaired[msg.sender]`)?
    *   Is the observation window currently active (`block.timestamp` check against `observationTriggeredTimestamp` and `observationWindowDuration`)?
    *   Does the user *currently* hold enough balance in the *Alpha* dimension (`ethAlphaBalances[msg.sender]` or `alphaBalances[msg.sender][token]`) to meet the *minimum Alpha threshold* (`entanglementThresholds[token].minAlpha`) for the asset they are trying to withdraw from *Beta*?
    This last check is crucial: your ability to withdraw from Beta is tied to your *current* state in Alpha.
5.  **Decoherence (Implicit):** If you withdraw from Alpha after triggering observation, you might drop below the required `minAlpha` threshold, causing subsequent `withdrawBetaEntangled` calls for that asset to fail, even within the window. Also, when the observation window expires, entangled withdrawals stop being possible until a new observation is triggered (if allowed).
6.  **Entanglement Thresholds:** Configurable by the owner. Define the "cost" or requirement for pairing and the ongoing requirement in Alpha for Beta withdrawal. Address(0) is used as a convention for ETH.
7.  **Supported Tokens:** An owner-managed list (`supportedTokens` mapping) restricts which ERC-20s can be deposited via the standard functions. `removeSupportedToken` doesn't remove existing balances but prevents further interaction via the `depositTokenAlpha/Beta` and `withdrawTokenAlpha/Beta` functions (though emergency owner functions can still access them).
8.  **`transferEntanglement`:** A unique function allowing a user to transfer their entire position, including their paired state and balances in *both* dimensions, to another address. This represents transferring the entire "quantum state" bundle. Requires careful consideration in a real system regarding recipient consent.
9.  **Function Count:** The design easily exceeds the 20-function requirement, providing 30 distinct functions including owner utilities and views.
10. **Advanced/Creative/Trendy:** The dual-dimension treasury, the explicit pairing/unpairing states, and especially the conditional Beta withdrawal logic dependent on a *current* state in the *linked* Alpha dimension, gated by an "observation" window, provide a non-standard mechanic. It's not a typical yield farm, lending protocol, or standard NFT contract. The "quantum" metaphor provides a creative framing for this state-dependent, conditionally accessible system. It touches on concepts like state manipulation, timed windows, and linked asset positions in a non-traditional way.

**Important Considerations for Production (This is a conceptual example):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating over supported tokens (e.g., in `pairMyDeposits` and `transferEntanglement`) can become very expensive if many tokens are supported. A production system would need a different state structure (like an array of supported token addresses managed alongside the mapping) to iterate efficiently.
*   **Security:** This is a complex contract with non-standard logic. It would require extensive auditing.
*   **Entanglement Condition Logic:** The current logic checks the *current* Alpha balance at withdrawal time. An alternative could be checking the Alpha balance *at the time of observation*, or averaging over the window. The current approach is simplest to implement but makes entangled withdrawal susceptible to post-observation Alpha withdrawals.
*   **Recipient Consent:** The `transferEntanglement` function as written doesn't require the `recipient` to approve. In a real system, this would need a two-step process or signature check.
*   **ETH Handling:** Using `call` with a check is the standard safe way to send ETH in modern Solidity.
*   **Error Messages:** More specific error messages could be helpful (`require` strings).

This contract provides a unique and complex treasury model leveraging concepts inspired by quantum mechanics to create interesting state transitions and conditional asset access.
