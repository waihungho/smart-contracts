Okay, let's design a smart contract for a "Decentralized Autonomous Creative Collective (DACC)". This contract will combine elements of a DAO, an NFT platform for creative works, a curation system, and a tokenomics model for rewards and governance.

It incorporates concepts like:
*   On-chain membership management (paid/staked entry)
*   Decentralized Proposal & Voting for funding and decisions
*   Project Management linked to proposals
*   Minting of NFTs representing approved creative works
*   On-chain Curation and Rating of creative works
*   Dynamic NFT attributes based on curation scores
*   Automated Collaborative Royalty Splitting for creators
*   Token rewards for active participation (proposing, voting, curating, creating)
*   A built-in ERC-20 token for governance and rewards
*   A built-in ERC-721 token for creative works

This combination creates a unique, integrated system that goes beyond typical examples like simple DAOs, basic NFT minting contracts, or standard token contracts.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeCollective`

**Inherits:** ERC20 (internal token), ERC721 (internal NFTs), Ownable, ReentrancyGuard

**Core Concepts:**
*   A collective where members collaborate on and fund creative projects.
*   Governance via proposals and token voting.
*   Creative outputs are represented as unique NFTs.
*   Members earn tokens for contributions (creation, curation, governance).
*   NFTs can have dynamic attributes influenced by curation.
*   Royalties from NFT sales can be split automatically among defined collaborators.

**State Variables:**
*   Basic contract parameters (owner, treasury address, fees, voting periods, etc.)
*   Mappings for member data (address -> Member struct)
*   Mappings for proposal data (ID -> Proposal struct)
*   Mappings for project data (ID -> Project struct)
*   Mappings for creative work/NFT data (token ID -> CreativeWork struct)
*   Mappings for curation votes (work ID -> voter -> score)
*   Mappings for member curation reputation (address -> reputation score)
*   Counters for proposals, projects, works, and token IDs.

**Enums:**
*   `ProposalState` (Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Executed)
*   `ProjectState` (Proposed, Approved, InProgress, Completed, Funded)

**Structs:**
*   `Member`: address, join time, staked amount, reputation score, claimable rewards.
*   `Proposal`: proposer, start time, end time, state, description, execution data (target address, value, calldata), votes for, votes against, min token threshold.
*   `Project`: proposal ID, state, creators[], submitted works[], funding amount, milestones.
*   `CreativeWork`: project ID, creators[], primary URI (static metadata), dynamic URI (for mutable attributes), curation score, royalty splits.

**Events:**
*   `MemberJoined`, `MemberLeft`
*   `ProposalSubmitted`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`
*   `ProjectFunded`, `CreativeWorkSubmitted`, `NFTMinted`
*   `CurationVoteCast`, `CurationScoreUpdated`
*   `RewardsClaimed`, `CollaboratorRoyaltiesClaimed`
*   `DynamicNFTAttributeUpdated`
*   `TreasuryWithdrawal`

**Modifiers:**
*   `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to the contract owner.
*   `onlyMember`: Restricts access to current collective members.
*   `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`: Standard pausable modifiers.
*   `onlyProposalState`: Restricts execution based on proposal state.

**Function Summary (Custom Functions - total > 20):**

1.  `constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, string memory nftName, string memory nftSymbol, address initialOwner)`: Initializes the contract, ERC20 token, ERC721 token, and owner.
2.  `joinCollective(uint256 amountToStake)`: Allows an address to become a member by staking the required amount of the collective's token.
3.  `leaveCollective()`: Allows a member to leave, unstaking tokens and potentially affecting reputation.
4.  `submitProposal(string memory description, address target, uint256 value, bytes memory calldata)`: Members can propose actions (funding projects, changing parameters, etc.).
5.  `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Members cast votes on proposals based on their token balance/stake.
6.  `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal (e.g., transfers funds, calls other contracts, triggers project funding).
7.  `submitCreativeWork(uint256 projectId, string memory primaryURI)`: Project creators submit the metadata for a creative work associated with an approved project.
8.  `mintCreativeNFT(uint256 workId, address recipient, uint256[] memory creatorShares)`: Mints an ERC721 NFT for a submitted work, assigning initial ownership and defining creator royalty splits.
9.  `submitCurationVote(uint256 workTokenId, uint8 score)`: Members can vote/rate the quality of a creative work (NFT).
10. `updateCurationScore(uint256 workTokenId)`: Updates the aggregate curation score for a work based on recent votes (could be triggered after votes or periodically).
11. `setDynamicNFTAttribute(uint256 workTokenId, string memory key, string memory value)`: Allows authorized entities (e.g., contract itself based on curation, or a specific role) to update mutable attributes of an NFT's metadata.
12. `claimRewards()`: Allows members to claim earned tokens based on their accumulated reward balance from contributions (voting, curation, creation).
13. `setCollaboratorRoyalties(uint256 workTokenId, address[] memory collaborators, uint256[] memory shares)`: Sets the royalty split percentages for collaborators on a specific NFT (sum must be 100%).
14. `claimCollaboratorRoyalties(uint256 workTokenId)`: Allows collaborators to claim their share of royalties accumulated from secondary sales (requires integration with a royalty standard like EIP-2981 or a marketplace). *Simplified here to claim from contract balance if contract receives royalties*.
15. `updateMembershipFee(uint256 newFee)`: Owner/Admin sets the required staking amount to join.
16. `updateVotingPeriod(uint256 newPeriod)`: Owner/Admin sets how long proposals are active.
17. `updateProposalThreshold(uint256 newThreshold)`: Owner/Admin sets the minimum token balance required to submit a proposal.
18. `setRewardParameters(...)`: Owner/Admin sets parameters for reward distribution calculation (e.g., tokens per vote, per curation vote, per created NFT).
19. `withdrawFromTreasury(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows treasury withdrawal *only* via proposal execution.
20. `getMemberDetails(address memberAddress)`: View function to retrieve a member's information.
21. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: View function to retrieve proposal information.
22. `getProjectDetails(uint256 projectId)`: View function to retrieve project information.
23. `getCreativeWorkDetails(uint256 workId)`: View function to retrieve creative work information before it's minted as an NFT.
24. `getWorkCurationScore(uint256 workTokenId)`: View function to get the current curation score of an NFT.
25. `getMemberCurationReputation(address memberAddress)`: View function to get a member's accumulated curation reputation.
26. `claimableRewards(address memberAddress)`: View function to see how many tokens a member can claim.

*(Note: Standard ERC20 and ERC721 functions like `transfer`, `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `tokenURI`, `approve`, etc., will also be available via inheritance, contributing to the total function count, but the list above focuses on the custom logic functions.)*

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Implemented:**

1.  **Integrated DAO, Token, and NFT System:** Unlike contracts that are *just* a DAO, *just* a token, or *just* an NFT, this contract tightly integrates all three. The token (`CRC`) is used for membership stake, voting power, and rewards. NFTs (`CRC_NFT`) are the output of DAO-approved projects.
2.  **Membership with Staking:** Joining requires staking `CRC` tokens, aligning incentives and potentially preventing sybil attacks in governance/curation. Leaving allows unstaking.
3.  **Decentralized Project Funding & Management:** Projects aren't just conceptual; they are tied to successful proposals (`submitProposal` -> `executeProposal` funds treasury/calls project contract -> `submitCreativeWork` -> `mintCreativeNFT`).
4.  **On-chain Curation System:** Members can rate (`submitCurationVote`) the creative work NFTs. This creates an on-chain reputation (`curationReputation`) for curators and a score (`curationScore`) for the works.
5.  **Dynamic NFTs:** The `dynamicURI` and `setDynamicNFTAttribute` functions provide a hook for NFTs to change their metadata based on on-chain events, specifically curation scores. This requires an off-chain service to actually generate and host the dynamic metadata, but the contract manages the link and authorization. `tokenURI` is overridden to serve the dynamic URI if available.
6.  **Automated Collaborative Royalty Splitting:** The `setCollaboratorRoyalties` and `claimCollaboratorRoyalties` functions allow defining multi-party royalty splits *at the time of minting* and provide a mechanism for creators to claim their share from a pool of royalties received by the contract (simplified implementation). This is a key feature for creative collaboration.
7.  **Token Rewards for Participation:** The contract explicitly rewards members for contributing to the collective's activities (voting, curating, creating) by increasing their `claimableRewards` balance, which they can then `claimRewards`.
8.  **Enumerable NFTs:** Inheriting `ERC721Enumerable` allows iterating through all owned NFTs, which can be useful for collective treasury management or displaying all community-created works on a front-end.
9.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Used on state-changing functions involving transfers (`joinCollective`, `leaveCollective`, `claimRewards`, `claimCollaboratorRoyalties`, `withdrawFromTreasury`) to protect against reentrancy attacks.

This contract provides a robust framework for a decentralized organization focused on creative output, using interconnected token, NFT, and governance mechanisms.
