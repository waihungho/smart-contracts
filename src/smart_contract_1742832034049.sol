 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It facilitates collaborative art creation, curation, exhibitions, and governance within a community of artists and art enthusiasts.

 * **Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *   - `requestMembership()`: Artists can request to join the collective.
 *   - `approveMembership(address _artist)`: Admin/DAO can approve membership requests.
 *   - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Admin/DAO can revoke membership.
 *   - `isMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *   - `getMembers()`: Returns a list of current members.

 * **2. Art Piece Submission & Management:**
 *   - `submitArtPiece(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Members can submit their art pieces with metadata (title, description, IPFS hash).
 *   - `getArtPieceDetails(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art piece.
 *   - `listArtPieceForSale(uint256 _artPieceId, uint256 _price)`: Artists can list their submitted art pieces for sale within the DAAC.
 *   - `purchaseArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Members can purchase art pieces listed for sale.
 *   - `withdrawArtPieceEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their earnings from art sales.
 *   - `getArtistArtPieces(address _artist)`: Returns a list of art pieces submitted by a specific artist.

 * **3. Exhibition Management:**
 *   - `createExhibitionProposal(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Members can propose new exhibitions.
 *   - `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on exhibition proposals.
 *   - `approveExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Admin/DAO can approve an exhibition after successful voting.
 *   - `addArtPieceToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artPieceId)`: Admin/DAO can add art pieces to an approved exhibition.
 *   - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts an approved exhibition.
 *   - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends a running exhibition.
 *   - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 *   - `getExhibitionArtPieces(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns a list of art pieces in a specific exhibition.

 * **4. DAO Governance & Settings:**
 *   - `setMembershipFee(uint256 _fee)`: Admin/DAO can set the membership fee.
 *   - `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the current membership fee.
 *   - `setPlatformFeePercentage(uint256 _percentage)`: Admin/DAO can set the platform fee percentage on art sales.
 *   - `getPlatformFeePercentage()`: Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 *   - `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Admin/DAO can withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *   - `transferAdminRights(address _newAdmin)`: Admin can transfer admin rights to a new address.
 *   - `pauseContract()`: Admin can pause the contract for maintenance.
 *   - `unpauseContract()`: Admin can unpause the contract.
 *   - `isContractPaused()`: Checks if the contract is paused.

 * **5. Utility Functions:**
 *   - `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.
