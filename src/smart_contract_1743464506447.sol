/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Conceptual and for illustrative purposes only)
 * @dev This smart contract outlines a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 *      with advanced features for art creation, curation, governance, and fractional ownership.
 *      It aims to be a creative and trendy platform for digital art in the Web3 space,
 *      incorporating DAO principles, NFT technologies, and community-driven art management.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art Management:**
 *    - `createArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to propose new artwork for the collective.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on art proposals.
 *    - `mintArt(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints approved art proposals as NFTs and transfers ownership to the collective.
 *    - `setArtMetadata(uint256 _artId, string memory _newMetadata)`: Allows updating metadata for existing art within the collective.
 *    - `transferArtOwnership(uint256 _artId, address _recipient)`: Allows the collective to transfer ownership of art NFTs (e.g., for sales, collaborations).
 *    - `burnArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows the collective to vote to burn (destroy) an art NFT.
 *
 * **2. Collective Governance & Membership:**
 *    - `joinCollective(string memory _reason)`: Allows users to apply for membership in the collective.
 *    - `voteOnMembership(address _applicant, bool _approve)`: Existing members vote on membership applications.
 *    - `contributeToCollective()`: Allows members (and potentially public) to contribute funds to the collective's treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromCollective(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to withdraw funds from the collective treasury (subject to governance rules).
 *    - `proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _proposalDetails)`: Allows members to propose changes to the collective's governance rules.
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on governance change proposals.
 *
 * **3. Financial & Reward Mechanisms:**
 *    - `fundArtCreation(uint256 _artId, uint256 _fundingAmount)`: Allows the collective to allocate funds from the treasury to support the creation of specific artworks.
 *    - `distributeArtRevenue(uint256 _artId, uint256 _revenueAmount)`: Distributes revenue generated from an art piece (e.g., from sales, royalties) to contributors and the treasury.
 *    - `rewardActiveMembers(address[] memory _members, uint256 _rewardAmount)`: Allows rewarding active members for their contributions to the collective.
 *
 * **4. Advanced & Trendy Features:**
 *    - `fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Fractionalizes ownership of an art NFT, creating fractional tokens representing shares.
 *    - `createArtCollabProposal(uint256 _artId, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Proposes a collaborative project based on an existing art piece.
 *    - `voteOnCollabProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on collaborative art proposals.
 *    - `setArtLicense(uint256 _artId, string memory _licenseDetails)`: Sets a specific usage license for an art NFT, defining rights and restrictions.
 *    - `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power to another address.
 *    - `emergencyShutdown()`: A function with specific conditions (e.g., majority vote or owner intervention) to halt critical contract functions in case of emergencies or critical vulnerabilities.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Implemented:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Concept:** The contract embodies the idea of a DAO focused on art. It's not just about buying and selling art, but about collective creation, curation, and governance.

2.  **Proposal and Voting System:**
    *   **Art Proposals:** Members can propose new artworks with titles, descriptions, and IPFS hashes (linking to the actual artwork data stored off-chain, which is common practice for NFTs to keep on-chain data size and gas costs low).
    *   **Governance Proposals:** Members can propose changes to the collective's rules and operations.
    *   **Voting Mechanism:**  Simple up/down voting with a voting duration. More advanced voting mechanisms (quadratic voting, weighted voting based on contribution, etc.) could be implemented.

3.  **NFT Integration (ERC721Enumerable Example):**
    *   The contract interacts with an external ERC721Enumerable NFT contract (example provided as `ERC721EnumerableNFT`). This separation of concerns is good practice. The DAAC contract manages the collective logic, and the NFT contract handles the NFT mechanics.
    *   `mintToCollective()` function in the NFT contract is intended to be called by the DAAC contract to mint NFTs and transfer ownership to the collective itself.
    *   `transferFrom()` and `burn()` are used to manage NFT ownership and destruction.
    *   **Enumerable:** The example NFT contract is `Enumerable`, meaning it *should* track all tokens and tokens owned by each address (though the example implementation is simplified and would need full implementation for real use).

4.  **Membership and Governance:**
    *   **Membership Application:** Users can apply for membership, potentially paying a fee.
    *   **Membership Voting:** Existing members vote on new applicants.
    *   **Governance Changes:**  Members can propose and vote on changes to the collective's governance.
    *   **Voting Delegation:** Members can delegate their voting power to another address, a common DAO feature.

5.  **Financial Mechanisms:**
    *   **Collective Treasury:**  The contract acts as a treasury, holding funds contributed by members or generated from art sales.
    *   **Contributions:** Members can contribute to the collective treasury.
    *   **Withdrawals:** Members can withdraw from the treasury (governance rules can be added to control withdrawals).
    *   **Art Funding:** The collective can allocate funds to support the creation of specific artworks.
    *   **Revenue Distribution:**  Revenue from art (sales, royalties) can be distributed back to members and the treasury (distribution logic can be customized).
    *   **Member Rewards:** Active members can be rewarded for their contributions.

6.  **Advanced & Trendy Features:**
    *   **Art Fractionalization:**  Functionality to fractionalize ownership of an art NFT. This is a trendy concept allowing for shared ownership and investment in valuable NFTs.  (Note:  This is a placeholder and would require integration with a fractional NFT standard or implementation of a fractional token system).
    *   **Collaborative Art Proposals:**  Facilitates proposing and voting on collaborative art projects based on existing art pieces.
    *   **Art Licenses:**  Allows setting specific usage licenses for art NFTs, defining rights and restrictions (e.g., Creative Commons licenses).
    *   **Emergency Shutdown:**  A safety mechanism to halt critical functions in case of emergencies or vulnerabilities. This is important for security and risk management in smart contracts.

7.  **Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted for all important actions, making it easier to track activity and integrate with off-chain systems.

8.  **Modifiers:**  Modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `onlyMembers`, `validArtProposal`, `validGovernanceProposal`, `artExists`) are used to enforce access control and preconditions, improving code readability and security.

9.  **Helper/View Functions:**  Provides functions to easily query the contract state, such as proposal statuses, art ownership, member details, and collective balance.

**Important Considerations and Potential Enhancements (Beyond the Scope of the Request but relevant for a real-world DAAC):**

*   **Robust Voting System:** Implement a more sophisticated voting system (e.g., quadratic voting, ranked-choice voting, weighted voting based on reputation/contribution).
*   **Reputation System:**  Incorporate a reputation system to track member contributions and influence, potentially affecting voting power and rewards.
*   **DAO Governance Framework:**  Integrate with a more established DAO framework or library for more robust governance features (e.g., snapshot voting, Aragon integration, Governor contracts from OpenZeppelin).
*   **Fractional NFT Implementation:**  Integrate with a proper fractional NFT standard or develop a robust fractional token system for `fractionalizeArt()`.
*   **Off-chain Storage and Metadata:**  For real art, IPFS or decentralized storage solutions are crucial for storing the actual artwork data and metadata reliably.
*   **Scalability and Gas Optimization:**  Consider gas optimization techniques, especially for functions that might be called frequently or involve loops. For very large collectives, scalability solutions might be needed (though Solidity smart contracts have inherent limitations).
*   **Security Audits:**  For any real-world deployment, rigorous security audits are essential to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:** Consider the legal and regulatory implications of DAOs and NFTs in your jurisdiction.

This smart contract provides a comprehensive and creative example of a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, incorporating many advanced and trendy concepts relevant to the Web3 and NFT space. Remember that this is a conceptual example, and a real-world implementation would require further development, testing, and security considerations.
