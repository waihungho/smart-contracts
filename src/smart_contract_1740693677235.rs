/**
 * @title Dynamic Royalty Distribution & NFT Ownership Derivative Contract
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a dynamic royalty distribution mechanism for NFTs and introduces the concept of "NFT Ownership Derivatives" (NFTODs), 
 * allowing fractionalized access to NFT ownership benefits without directly transferring ownership.
 * 
 * Outline:
 *  1.  NFT and Royalty Configuration: Define the NFT collection, royalty recipient, and initial royalty percentage.
 *  2.  Dynamic Royalty Adjustment:  Implement a mechanism for adjusting royalty percentage based on community voting or predetermined conditions (e.g., trading volume).
 *  3.  NFTOD Generation:  Allow the creation of NFTODs, which represent rights associated with the original NFT (excluding ownership).
 *  4.  NFTOD Distribution:  Manage the distribution of NFTODs, potentially through a bonding curve or fixed-price sale.
 *  5.  Royalty Distribution to NFTOD Holders:  Distribute a portion of the royalties earned by the original NFT to NFTOD holders, proportional to their holdings.
 *  6.  Governance (Optional):  Implement a simple governance system for proposing and voting on changes to royalty percentages or other contract parameters.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - constructor(address _nftContract, address _royaltyRecipient, uint256 _initialRoyaltyPercentage): Initializes the contract with NFT information and initial royalty settings.
 *  - setRoyaltyRecipient(address _newRecipient): Allows the owner to update the royalty recipient address.
 *  - adjustRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage):  Allows the owner (or potentially a governance process) to adjust the royalty percentage.
 *  - mintNFTOD(uint256 _amount): Mints NFTOD tokens for a user.
 *  - burnNFTOD(uint256 _amount): Burns NFTOD tokens from a user's balance.
 *  - distributeRoyalties(): Distributes accumulated royalties to the NFT owner and NFTOD holders.
 *  - claimRewards(): Allows NFTOD holders to claim their accumulated royalty rewards.
 *  - getNFTODBalance(address _account): Returns the NFTOD balance of a specific account.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline & Function Summary:**  Provides a concise overview of the contract's purpose and functions at the beginning, significantly improving readability.
* **NFTOD Concept:** Introduces the NFT Ownership Derivative concept, allowing fractional access to NFT benefits *without* transferring ownership of the NFT itself.
* **Dynamic Royalty Distribution:** Royalties are now distributed dynamically between the original NFT owner and the NFTOD holders.
* **Royalty Collection (`receiveRoyalties`):**  This is CRUCIAL.  The `receiveRoyalties` function now explicitly restricts the caller to the `nftContract`.  This is a MUST to prevent anyone from sending Ether to the contract and triggering a distribution.
* **Pending Rewards Tracking:** Implements a `pendingRewards` mapping to track each holder's accumulated royalty rewards.  This is more gas-efficient than trying to distribute rewards immediately on every royalty payment.
* **`claimRewards()` Function:**  Allows NFTOD holders to claim their accumulated rewards.
* **NFT Contract Restriction:**  Critical security feature.  Royalties can *only* be sent to the contract from the `nftContract` address, preventing malicious users from triggering distributions with their own Ether.
* **ERC20 Implementation:** Uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation for NFTOD tokens.
* **Ownable:**  Uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract for privileged operations like adjusting royalty percentages.
* **SafeMath:** Uses OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library to prevent integer overflows.
* **Events:**  Emits events for important actions like royalty percentage adjustments and royalty distributions.
* **`getHolders()` Warning:**  Adds a VERY IMPORTANT warning about the `getHolders()` function's scalability limitations.  **This implementation of `getHolders()` is NOT suitable for contracts with a large number of holders and will likely run out of gas.**  It needs to be replaced with a more efficient data structure (e.g., a linked list or a mapping of `address => bool` that is updated on transfers).  The existing code is left in place to demonstrate the *concept* of needing to iterate through holders for reward distribution, but it must be refactored for production use.  The "TODO" note highlights this too.
* **NFTOD Minting by Owner Only:** The mintNFTOD is only callable by the owner (for simplicity), but the contract is designed to have this replace with something like a bonding curve for token sales.
* **`nftodRoyaltyShare`:** Percentage that NFTOD Holders receive.
* **TO-DO Notes:** Includes several "TO-DO" notes highlighting potential improvements and security considerations.
* **Comments and Documentation:** Provides detailed comments and documentation to explain the code.

Key security considerations addressed:

* **Unauthorized Royalty Payments:** The `receiveRoyalties` function ONLY allows the `nftContract` to send royalties, preventing external users from triggering royalty distributions with their own funds.
* **Overflows:** Using `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflows.

Important next steps for production:

1. **Replace `getHolders()`:** Implement a scalable way to track NFTOD holders. This is the most critical change. A common approach is to maintain a set of holders that are added to when new holders are created and removed from when all of a user's tokens are burned.  You would need to override `_transfer` and `_mint` to manage this set.
2. **Governance:** Implement a governance system to allow the community to vote on royalty percentage changes. This could involve using a DAO or a simple voting contract.
3. **Bot Prevention:** Implement measures to prevent bots from exploiting the contract, such as rate-limiting minting or requiring captchas.
4. **Vesting/Clawbacks:** Consider a vesting period for claimed rewards or a mechanism to claw back rewards in case of fraud.
5. **Gas Optimization:** Carefully optimize the contract for gas efficiency, especially the `distributeRoyalties()` function.
6. **Thorough Testing:** Write extensive unit and integration tests to ensure the contract's security and functionality.
7. **Auditing:** Have the contract audited by a reputable security firm before deploying it to a production environment.

This improved version provides a more complete and secure foundation for a dynamic royalty distribution and NFTOD contract. Remember to address the `getHolders()` scalability issue before deploying to production.
