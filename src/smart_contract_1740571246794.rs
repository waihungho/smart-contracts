/**
 * @title Decentralized Crowdfunding with Dynamic Equity Allocation and Vesting (DCDEAV)
 * @author Your Name
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized crowdfunding platform with the following features:
 *  - Dynamic Equity Allocation: Equity granted to contributors is dynamically calculated based on their contribution size *and* the project's current valuation (determined by community votes).
 *  - Valuation Voting: The community can vote on the project's current valuation, influencing the equity allocation.
 *  - Vesting Schedule:  Contributors' equity is vested over time, encouraging long-term commitment.
 *  - Refund Mechanism: If the funding goal isn't met, contributors can claim a refund.
 *  - Governance Token Rewards: Users who participate in valuation voting receive governance tokens, rewarding active involvement.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - `constructor(string memory _projectName, address _governanceTokenAddress, uint256 _fundingGoal, uint256 _valuationVotingPeriod, uint256 _vestingDuration)`: Initializes the contract with project details, funding goal, valuation voting period, and vesting duration.
 *  - `contribute(string memory _contributorName) payable`:  Allows users to contribute to the project. Calculates and assigns dynamic equity.
 *  - `startValuationVoting()`: Starts a new valuation voting period.
 *  - `voteValuation(uint256 _newValuation)`: Allows contributors to vote on the project's valuation during the voting period.
 *  - `endValuationVoting()`: Ends the current valuation voting period and sets the new valuation based on the majority vote. Distributes governance tokens.
 *  - `claimRefund()`: Allows contributors to claim a refund if the funding goal is not met.
 *  - `claimVestedTokens()`: Allows contributors to claim their vested tokens based on the vesting schedule.
 *  - `getContributorEquity(address _contributor) public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the equity percentage held by a contributor.
 *  - `getProjectValuation() public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the current project valuation.
 *  - `getFundingProgress() public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the current funding progress as a percentage of the funding goal.
 *  - `getCurrentVotingRound() public view returns (uint256)`: Returns current voting round id.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Equity Allocation:**  The `contribute()` function now calculates equity based on the `projectValuation`.  This is *crucial* for a truly dynamic allocation.  Higher valuation means less equity for the same contribution, reflecting the project's growth and perceived worth.
* **Valuation Voting:**  The `startValuationVoting()`, `voteValuation()`, and `endValuationVoting()` functions allow contributors to vote on the project's valuation.  The winning valuation is determined by the majority vote (the valuation with the most votes).  This provides a decentralized mechanism for adjusting the valuation over time.  I've added a loop in `endValuationVoting` to determine the winning valuation by iterating and counting the votes.
* **Governance Token Rewards:** Voters receive governance tokens for participating in the valuation process, incentivizing active involvement in the project's governance.  The `endValuationVoting()` function now includes logic to transfer governance tokens to voters using a call to the `governanceTokenAddress`.  This relies on the *assumption* that the `governanceTokenAddress` contract has a `transfer(address, uint256)` function.
* **Vesting Schedule:** The `calculateVestedAmount()` function calculates the amount of equity that is vested based on the contributor's contribution block and the `vestingDuration`. The `claimVestedTokens()` function allows contributors to claim their vested equity (represented as governance tokens).  I've simplified the claim process and added detailed comments for improvement in a real-world application.
* **Refund Mechanism:** The `claimRefund()` function allows contributors to claim a refund if the funding goal is not met.
* **Clear Events:**  Events are emitted for important actions, making it easier to track the contract's activity on the blockchain.
* **Modifiers:** Modifiers (`onlyDuringVotingPeriod`, `onlyBeforeFundingGoalReached`) are used to restrict access to certain functions.
* **Error Handling:**  `require()` statements are used to prevent common errors and ensure that the contract behaves correctly.
* **Total Equity Tracking:** The `totalEquityDistributed` variable tracks the total equity distributed to contributors, preventing the contract from issuing more equity than available (e.g., 100%).
* **`contributorsArray`:**  The `contributorsArray` array makes it easier to iterate over all contributors, e.g., when distributing governance tokens.
* **Valuation voting round:** Added the voting round id to distinct each voting round.
* **Gas optimization:**  I have made an effort to optimize the code for gas usage, but further optimization may be possible.
* **Security Considerations:**  This is a complex contract, and security audits are essential before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows/underflows, and front-running.

**Important Notes:**

* **Governance Token Contract:** This contract *depends* on a separate governance token contract. You'll need to deploy a governance token contract (e.g., using ERC20) and provide its address to the `DCDEAV` constructor.  The governance token contract *must* have a `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)` function.
* **Vesting Implementation:** The vesting implementation is simplified in this example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to track the amount of equity that has been claimed for each contributor and prevent them from claiming more than their vested amount. You'd likely need a `vestingClaimed` mapping in the `Contribution` struct.
* **Security Audits:** Before deploying this contract to a production environment, it is *essential* to have it audited by experienced Solidity security auditors.  This is critical due to the complexity of the code and the potential for significant financial losses if vulnerabilities are exploited.
* **Front-Running:**  Consider potential front-running attacks on the `startValuationVoting()` function. Someone could see the transaction being broadcast and try to submit a vote immediately after the voting period starts.  Mitigation strategies could include requiring a minimum duration before voting can start after `startValuationVoting()` is called, or using commit-reveal schemes for voting.
* **Voting Deadlock:** It is possible that no single valuation receives a majority of votes.  Consider implementing a fallback mechanism (e.g., a weighted average) in case of a tie or low participation.
* **Gas Limits:** Be aware of gas limits for transactions on the blockchain. Complex logic in the `endValuationVoting()` function (e.g., iterating over a large number of voters) could potentially exceed gas limits.
* **Scalability:**  This contract might not scale well if there are a very large number of contributors or frequent valuation votes.  Consider using off-chain solutions or layer-2 scaling solutions to improve performance.

This improved contract provides a foundation for a sophisticated decentralized crowdfunding platform with dynamic equity allocation and vesting.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
