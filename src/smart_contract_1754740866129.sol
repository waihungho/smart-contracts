Okay, this is a fantastic challenge! Creating something truly unique and advanced without duplicating existing open-source projects requires abstracting common patterns and re-combining them in novel ways, or introducing concepts that are typically off-chain into the on-chain logic, even if their actual "intelligence" comes from an oracle.

Let's design a "QuantumLeap DAO" â€“ a decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding and governing highly innovative, potentially speculative projects, with an emphasis on adaptive governance, dynamic treasury management influenced by external data, and a layered reputation system to encourage long-term participation and accountability.

---

## QuantumLeap DAO: Adaptive, Resilient, & Data-Driven Governance for Frontier Projects

**Concept:** The QuantumLeap DAO is designed for funding and managing high-risk, high-reward "frontier" projects (e.g., quantum computing research, advanced AI ethics, deep space exploration tech). Its core innovation lies in its ability to adapt its governance parameters and treasury strategy based on real-time external data (e.g., market sentiment, "AI advisor" scores, specific project milestones). It incorporates a multi-faceted reputation system to reward long-term engagement and informed decision-making, and mechanisms for "future-dated" commitments and emergency protocols.

---

### Outline:

1.  **Introduction & Core Mechanics:**
    *   Token (`QLG` - QuantumLeap Governance Token)
    *   Standard Proposal & Voting System
    *   Basic Treasury Management

2.  **Adaptive Governance Layer:**
    *   Dynamic Quorum & Voting Period Adjustments
    *   "Adaptive Criteria" for parameter tuning
    *   Integration with "AI Advisor" Oracle (conceptual)

3.  **Dynamic Treasury Management:**
    *   Multi-Asset Treasury
    *   Risk Profile Definition & Management
    *   Automated (DAO-approved) Rebalancing based on market data

4.  **Reputation & Engagement System:**
    *   Staking for Voting Power & Reputation
    *   Time-decaying Reputation
    *   Reputation-based Tiers
    *   Delegation with Reputation Weighting

5.  **Advanced Features & Resilience:**
    *   Milestone-Based Fund Releases
    *   Contingency Protocols
    *   "Snapshot & Recall" for past states
    *   Inter-DAO Collaboration Interface (conceptual)

### Function Summary (20+ Functions):

1.  `constructor(address _initialOwner, string memory _name, string memory _symbol)`: Initializes the QLG token and sets the initial DAO owner.
2.  `submitProposal(string memory _description, address _target, bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _value, uint256 _requiredReputation)`: Allows QLG holders with sufficient reputation to submit new proposals.
3.  `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote (for or against) on a proposal.
4.  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal, if conditions (quorum, majority, time) are met.
5.  `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer or a high-reputation member to cancel a pending proposal under specific conditions.
6.  `getCurrentVotingPower(address _voter)`: Returns a voter's current reputation-weighted voting power.
7.  `stakeQLG(uint256 _amount)`: Stakes QLG tokens to gain reputation and active voting power.
8.  `unstakeQLG(uint256 _amount)`: Unstakes QLG tokens after a cooldown period, reducing reputation.
9.  `delegateReputation(address _delegatee)`: Delegates one's voting power and reputation to another address.
10. `revokeDelegation()`: Revokes any existing delegation.
11. `depositTreasury(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows external parties or the DAO to deposit approved ERC20 tokens or ETH into the DAO's treasury.
12. `proposeTreasuryReallocation(address[] memory _assetsToSell, uint256[] memory _amountsToSell, address[] memory _assetsToBuy, uint256[] memory _amountsToBuy)`: Submits a proposal for rebalancing the DAO's treasury assets.
13. `executeTreasuryReallocation(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted treasury reallocation proposal.
14. `setAdaptiveCriteriaWeights(uint8 _marketSentimentWeight, uint8 _advisorScoreWeight, uint8 _participationRateWeight)`: A DAO proposal to adjust the weights of different criteria influencing adaptive governance.
15. `updateAdaptiveScore(uint256 _marketSentimentScore, uint256 _advisorScore, uint256 _participationRateScore)`: (Callable by Oracle/Trusted Relayer) Updates the DAO's internal adaptive scores, which then influence governance parameters.
16. `triggerAdaptiveParameterAdjustment()`: Automatically adjusts quorum, voting period, or other parameters based on the current adaptive scores and weights.
17. `proposeMilestoneBasedFundRelease(address _projectAddress, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _milestoneHash, uint256 _releaseTimestamp, string memory _description)`: Proposes a future fund release contingent on an off-chain milestone verification.
18. `verifyMilestoneAndRelease(uint256 _fundReleaseId, bytes memory _proof)`: (Callable by Oracle/MultiSig) Verifies a milestone and releases funds if conditions are met.
19. `initiateContingencyProtocol(bytes32 _protocolIdentifier)`: Activates a pre-approved emergency protocol (e.g., pause fund withdrawals, emergency asset sale) based on critical external events/thresholds.
20. `setContingencyThresholds(bytes32 _protocolIdentifier, uint256 _criticalValue)`: A DAO proposal to define or update the thresholds that trigger contingency protocols.
21. `snapshotDaoState()`: Allows the DAO to vote to create an on-chain "snapshot" of key governance parameters and treasury balances for historical analysis or dispute resolution.
22. `getHistoricalDaoState(uint256 _snapshotId)`: Retrieves a read-only view of a previously snapshotted DAO state.
23. `proposeInterDaoCollaboration(address _partnerDao, string memory _collaborationDetails)`: Submits a proposal for a formal collaboration with another DAO, potentially leading to cross-chain interactions.
24. `setMinimumReputationToPropose(uint256 _newMinReputation)`: A DAO-governed function to adjust the minimum reputation required to submit a proposal.
25. `withdrawStakingRewards()`: Allows stakers to withdraw accumulated reputation-based rewards (if implemented with an internal reward pool).
