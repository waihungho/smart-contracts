This smart contract, **AetherFlux Protocol**, introduces an advanced concept for decentralized protocol orchestration and self-adaptive resource allocation. Unlike traditional DAOs that govern a fixed set of parameters or a treasury, AetherFlux aims to act as a **"meta-incubator"** or **"protocol of protocols"**. It facilitates the community-driven identification, prioritization, and activation of new decentralized initiatives (called "Objectives") based on a dynamic "Flux Energy" system.

The core idea is that the protocol can **adapt its focus and resource allocation** by evaluating various on-chain "Flux Indicators" (like resource contributions and engagement frequency) against customizable "Adaptive Weights." This allows the protocol to dynamically prioritize which "Objectives" (high-level goals) and their associated "Manifests" (detailed plans) should be activated and supported in a given "Epoch."

It encourages modularity by allowing external "Module Contracts" to be registered and then associated with activated objectives, promoting a reusable ecosystem of decentralized components.

## AetherFlux Protocol: Outline and Function Summary

**I. Core Protocol State & Configuration**
This section defines the fundamental data structures and configuration parameters that govern the AetherFlux Protocol. It includes enumerations for various on-chain signals (Flux Indicators) that influence the protocol's adaptive decision-making process, as well as structs for defining objectives, manifests, and modular components.
*   **`FluxIndicator` Enum**: Represents different types of on-chain signals (e.g., `ResourceAllocation`, `EngagementFrequency`) that contribute to an objective's priority score.
*   **`ObjectiveStatus` Enum**: Tracks the lifecycle of a protocol objective (Proposed, Approved, Active, Deactivated, Rejected).
*   **`ProtocolObjective` Struct**: Describes a high-level goal, including its name, description, proposer, status, and accumulated flux energy.
*   **`ProtocolManifest` Struct**: Details a specific plan for an objective, including required module addresses, resource requirements, and approval status.
*   **`ModuleInfo` Struct**: Stores information about registered external modular contracts.
*   **`WeightChangeProposal` Struct**: Defines a proposal for altering the adaptive weights that determine objective prioritization.
*   **Key State Variables**:
    *   `owner`: The contract's governance address.
    *   `epochDuration`: The time period (in seconds) after which the protocol re-evaluates its focus.
    *   `lastEpochAllocationTime`: Timestamp of the last focus allocation.
    *   `totalFluxEnergy`: The collective conceptual energy of the protocol from all contributions.
    *   `adaptiveWeights`: A mapping defining how different `FluxIndicator`s influence protocol "focus" and objective prioritization.
    *   `objectives`, `manifests`, `modules`, `weightChangeProposals`: Mappings for storing these structured data based on their unique IDs or addresses.
    *   `objectiveToManifests`: Links objectives to their submitted manifests.
    *   `objectiveFluxEnergy`, `objectiveEngagementCounts`: Track specific metrics for each objective.
    *   `activatedObjectives`: A dynamic array of currently active objective IDs.

**II. Objective & Manifest Management (6 Functions)**
These functions allow users to propose new high-level protocol objectives and detailed manifests, while providing governance mechanisms for approval or rejection.
1.  **`proposeObjective(string calldata _name, string calldata _description, FluxIndicator[] calldata _initialIndicators)`**: Allows any user to submit a new high-level "Objective" for the protocol to consider.
2.  **`submitManifest(uint256 _objectiveId, string calldata _manifestUrl, address[] calldata _requiredModules, uint256 _requiredEnergy)`**: Allows the proposer of an *approved* objective to submit a detailed "Manifest" (plan) for its implementation.
3.  **`approveManifest(uint256 _manifestId)`**: (Admin/Owner) Approves a submitted manifest, making it eligible for activation if its objective gains sufficient focus.
4.  **`rejectManifest(uint256 _manifestId)`**: (Admin/Owner) Rejects a submitted manifest.
5.  **`retractObjective(uint256 _objectiveId)`**: Allows the original proposer to withdraw their objective if it hasn't been approved yet.
6.  **`retractManifest(uint256 _manifestId)`**: Allows the original manifest submitter to withdraw their manifest if it hasn't been approved yet.

**III. Flux & Resource Allocation (4 Functions)**
These functions manage the contribution of "flux" (resources, primarily ETH) to objectives and orchestrate the protocol's adaptive mechanism for prioritizing objectives.
7.  **`contributeFlux(uint256 _objectiveId)`**: (Payable) Users contribute Ether (flux) to a specific objective, increasing its `currentFluxEnergy` and its `engagementCount`.
8.  **`allocateEpochFocus()`**: (Callable by anyone) Triggers the protocol's adaptive allocation mechanism. It re-evaluates all approved objectives based on their accumulated `fluxEnergy`, `engagementCount`, and the global `adaptiveWeights` to determine which objectives are currently most prioritized. Can only be called once per `epochDuration`.
9.  **`getCurrentObjectiveFocus()`**: Returns the ID(s) of the objective(s) that are currently prioritized based on the last `allocateEpochFocus` run.
10. **`getObjectiveFlux(uint256 _objectiveId)`**: Retrieves the total flux energy contributed to a specific objective.

**IV. Module & Activation (5 Functions)**
This section handles the registration of external modular contracts that can be reused across objectives, and the activation/deactivation of objectives themselves, linking them to chosen modules.
11. **`registerModule(address _moduleAddress, string calldata _description, string[] calldata _tags)`**: Allows developers to register their modular smart contracts as reusable components within the AetherFlux ecosystem.
12. **`activateObjective(uint256 _objectiveId, uint256 _manifestId, address[] calldata _moduleInstances)`**: (Admin/Owner) Marks a prioritized objective as "Active" if its manifest is approved and its required energy is met. This function logs the association with specific instances of registered modules.
13. **`deactivateObjective(uint256 _objectiveId)`**: (Admin/Owner) Changes an active objective's status to "Deactivated," useful for completed or abandoned initiatives.
14. **`getModuleInfo(address _moduleAddress)`**: Retrieves detailed information about a registered module.
15. **`getActivatedObjectives()`**: Returns a list of all objective IDs that are currently in an "Active" state.

**V. Protocol Self-Adaptation (Governance/Meta-Governance) (5 Functions)**
These functions enable the protocol's core governance (initially the deployer) to adapt and evolve its internal mechanisms, such as changing the influence of different flux indicators or modifying epoch durations.
16. **`proposeWeightChange(FluxIndicator _indicator, uint256 _newWeight)`**: (Admin/Owner) Initiates a proposal to change the adaptive weight for a specific `FluxIndicator`. This creates a proposal ID for tracking.
17. **`executeWeightChange(uint256 _proposalId)`**: (Admin/Owner) Executes a proposed weight change, updating the protocol's `adaptiveWeights`. This implicitly assumes a conceptual voting/timelock period has passed (the voting mechanism itself is external to this simplified contract for brevity).
18. **`getWeightChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Retrieves details about a specific weight change proposal.
19. **`updateEpochDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`**: (Admin/Owner) Modifies the duration of an epoch, impacting how frequently the protocol's focus is re-evaluated.
20. **`setGovernanceAddress(address _newGovernance)`**: (Admin/Owner) Transfers the ownership (governance role) of the contract to a new address.
