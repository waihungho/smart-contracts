Okay, let's design a creative and advanced smart contract concept. We'll build a "Quantum Flux Protocol" where users can stake tokens to create "Quantum Nodes" that generate yield based on dynamic factors, including their internal state, age, and an external "Protocol Condition" simulated via an oracle. The Nodes themselves can be upgraded and decay over time, and rewards have a vesting mechanism.

This avoids simple token/NFT standards directly but uses similar concepts (staking, unique IDs, dynamic properties) combined with complex reward logic and external data influence.

**Quantum Flux Protocol Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Description:** A protocol where users stake $FLUX tokens to create and manage dynamic Quantum Nodes. These Nodes generate yield based on their internal state ("Flux Power"), age, and a protocol-wide "Quantum Fluctuation" factor (simulated oracle data). Nodes can be upgraded, decay over time, and transfer ownership. Rewards are subject to a vesting schedule.
2.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   Dynamic Node Properties (Flux Power)
    *   Yield Generation based on multiple factors (Staked Amount, Flux Power, Age, Protocol Condition)
    *   Node Decay and Upgrade mechanics
    *   Simulated Oracle Influence (Protocol Condition)
    *   Vesting Rewards
    *   Unique Node Identification (like a non-standard NFT)
3.  **Core Components:**
    *   State Variables: Protocol settings, token addresses, node details, user balances, reward tracking.
    *   Data Structures: `QuantumNode` struct.
    *   Events: Signalling key actions (NodeCreated, Upgraded, Decayed, RewardsClaimed, ConditionUpdated).
    *   Modifiers: Access control (Owner, Paused).
    *   Functions:
        *   Admin/Setup
        *   Staking/Unstaking
        *   Node Creation/Management (Create, Upgrade, Decay, Transfer, Dismantle)
        *   Reward Calculation & Claiming
        *   External Data Simulation (Protocol Condition)
        *   Querying/Views

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, sets owner.
2.  `setFluxToken(address _token)`: Sets the address of the ERC20 Flux token.
3.  `updateStakingParameters(...)`: Sets minimum stake, decay rate, upgrade costs.
4.  `updateRewardParameters(...)`: Sets base reward rate, vesting period, flux power multiplier.
5.  `updateProtocolCondition(uint256 _newCondition)`: Simulates an oracle update for the global condition (Owner only).
6.  `pauseProtocol()`: Pauses core protocol operations.
7.  `unpauseProtocol()`: Unpauses protocol operations.
8.  `stakeFlux(uint256 amount)`: Stakes Flux tokens into the user's general balance.
9.  `unstakeFlux(uint256 amount)`: Unstakes Flux tokens from the user's general balance.
10. `createQuantumNode(uint256 initialStake)`: Uses staked Flux to create a new Node.
11. `upgradeQuantumNode(uint256 nodeId, uint256 additionalStake)`: Stakes more Flux into an existing Node to boost its power.
12. `decayQuantumNode(uint256 nodeId)`: Applies time-based decay to a Node's Flux Power.
13. `dismantleQuantumNode(uint256 nodeId)`: Destroys a Node, returning the staked amount (potentially with a fee/penalty).
14. `transferQuantumNode(address to, uint256 nodeId)`: Transfers ownership of a Node.
15. `calculateNodePendingRewards(uint256 nodeId)`: Calculates pending rewards for a specific Node since last calculation/claim.
16. `calculateUserPendingRewards(address user)`: Calculates total pending rewards across all user's Nodes.
17. `claimRewards()`: Claims available vested rewards for the caller.
18. `getClaimableRewards(address user)`: Gets rewards immediately available for claiming (passed vesting).
19. `getQuantumNodeDetails(uint256 nodeId)`: Gets details of a specific Node.
20. `getUserNodes(address user)`: Gets list of Node IDs owned by a user.
21. `getStakedBalance(address user)`: Gets user's general staked balance.
22. `getTotalStaked()`: Gets total Flux staked in the protocol.
23. `getTotalNodes()`: Gets total active Nodes.
24. `getProtocolCondition()`: Gets the current simulated Protocol Condition value.
25. `getNodeStakedAmount(uint256 nodeId)`: Gets the Flux staked within a specific Node.
26. `getNodeFluxPower(uint256 nodeId)`: Gets the current Flux Power of a Node.
27. `getNodeAge(uint256 nodeId)`: Gets the age of a Node.
28. `getRewardParameters()`: Gets current reward configuration.
29. `getStakingParameters()`: Gets current staking configuration.
30. `getOwnedNodeCount(address user)`: Gets the number of Nodes owned by a user.

         // Let's use `lastUserClaimTime` as the baseline. Rewards earned *after* `lastUserClaimTime` are subject to vesting relative to their earn time. This is still complex.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**

1.  **Gas Costs:** Iterating through all nodes (`getTotalStaked` if not using a state variable, `calculateUserPendingRewards`, `claimRewards` if calculating on the fly for all nodes) can be very gas-intensive as the number of nodes grows. The current implementation of `getTotalStaked` calculating explicitly is *very* inefficient for large `_nextNodeId`. Using a state variable is better if maintained perfectly across all deposit/withdrawal actions. Iterating through `userNodes` is better than iterating through all possible node IDs, but still scales with the number of nodes *per user*.
2.  **Scaling & Precision:** All calculations involving rates, multipliers, and time need careful consideration of scaling (using 1e18 or similar fixed-point representation) to maintain precision and avoid integer truncation. The example calculations provided are illustrative and may need adjustment for real-world use and large numbers.
3.  **Vesting Implementation:** The vesting logic in this example is significantly simplified. A real-world vesting system based on *when* rewards were earned and the vesting period would require more complex state management (e.g., tracking reward "batches" with timestamps).
4.  **Oracle Dependency:** The `updateProtocolCondition` is a *simulation*. A real protocol relying on external data would need a secure oracle integration (like Chainlink).
5.  **Security:** This is an *example* contract demonstrating concepts. It has not been audited and may contain vulnerabilities. Production-level contracts require extensive testing, formal verification, and professional audits.
6.  **Error Handling:** While some `require` statements are included, comprehensive error handling and edge case testing are crucial for production code.
7.  **State Management:** Efficiently managing mappings and arrays (`userNodes`, `userNodeIndex`) is important for gas costs. The `_removeNodeFromUser` function uses a standard efficient pattern.
8.  **Upgradeability:** This contract is not designed to be upgradeable. For a long-term protocol, consider using upgradeable patterns (e.g., proxies).

This contract provides a framework illustrating several advanced concepts in a single system, going beyond basic token transfers or simple staking.
