Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract called `QuantumVault`. It incorporates concepts like conditional access based on time, reputation, hypothetical ZK proofs, and external data oracle verification. It also includes a basic internal reputation system and delegation features.

This contract is designed to be illustrative of advanced concepts rather than production-ready. The interactions with "ZK Verifier" and "Data Oracle" are simulated calls to hypothetical external contracts/oracles. It requires Solidity 0.8+.

// Functions:
//
// --- Admin/Setup Functions (Restricted to Owner) ---
// 1. constructor(address _zkProofVerifier, address _dataConditionOracle, uint256 _defaultMinReputationScore): Initializes the contract, setting initial verifier, oracle, and default reputation.
// 2. addSupportedToken(address tokenAddress): Adds an ERC20 token to the supported list.
// 3. removeSupportedToken(address tokenAddress): Removes an ERC20 token from the supported list.
// 4. setZKVerifier(address _zkProofVerifier): Sets the address for the hypothetical ZK proof verifier contract.
// 5. setDataConditionOracle(address _dataConditionOracle): Sets the address for the hypothetical external data oracle contract.
// 6. setDefaultMinReputation(uint256 _score): Sets the default minimum reputation score used in some operations.
// 7. updateVaultStatusAdmin(address user, uint256 vaultId, VaultStatus newStatus): Allows admin to override/force a vault status change (e.g., emergency).
// 8. penalizeReputation(address user, uint256 amount): Admin function to decrease a user's reputation.
// 9. rewardReputation(address user, uint256 amount): Admin function to increase a user's reputation.
// 10. withdrawAdminFees(): Placeholder - would withdraw accumulated fees if implemented. (Currently no fees)
//
// --- Vault Creation Functions ---
// 11. deposit(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount): Deposits tokens into a simple time-locked vault (default conditions).
// 12. depositWithConditions(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, UnlockConditions memory conditions, bytes32 associatedDataHash): Deposits tokens with complex, user-defined conditions.
//
// --- Vault Condition & Status Management Functions ---
// 13. updateAssociatedDataHash(uint256 vaultId, bytes32 newHash): Updates the off-chain data hash associated with a vault (requires specific status).
// 14. requestConditionalUnlock(uint256 vaultId): User requests the vault to check conditions and transition state.
// 15. provideZKProof(uint256 vaultId, bytes memory proofData): User provides ZK proof data; calls hypothetical verifier.
// 16. provideDataConditionProof(uint256 vaultId, bytes memory data, bytes memory signature): User provides data/signature; calls hypothetical oracle.
// 17. triggerReputationCheck(uint256 vaultId): User triggers a check if their current reputation meets the vault's requirement.
// 18. cancelDeposit(uint256 vaultId): Allows the user to cancel a deposit if conditions haven't been met and potentially after a time window (with reputation consequence).
//
// --- Vault Withdrawal & Delegation Functions ---
// 19. attemptWithdraw(uint256 vaultId): Attempts to withdraw tokens if the vault is in the 'Open' status.
// 20. delegateAccess(uint256 vaultId, address delegatee, uint256 expiryTimestamp): Delegates access to withdraw a specific vault to another address until a specific time.
// 21. revokeDelegateAccess(uint256 vaultId): Revokes any active delegation for a vault.
//
// --- View Functions (Read-only) ---
// 22. getVaultDetails(address user, uint256 vaultId): Gets full details for a user's specific vault.
// 23. getUserVaultIds(address user): Gets all vault IDs for a user.

// 25. getUserReputation(address user): Gets a user's current reputation score.
// 26. getSupportedTokens(): Gets the list of supported token addresses.
// 27. getZKVerifier(): Gets the ZK verifier contract address.
// 28. getDataConditionOracle(): Gets the data oracle contract address.
// 29. getVaultConditions(address user, uint256 vaultId): Gets just the unlock conditions for a user's specific vault.
// 30. checkVaultConditionsMet(uint256 vaultId): Checks if all *currently verifiable* conditions are met (view function, does not change state).
// 31. getDelegatee(address user, uint256 vaultId): Gets the current delegatee for a vault.
// 32. getDelegateeExpiry(address user, uint256 vaultId): Gets the delegation expiry for a vault.

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Multi-Condition Unlock (`UnlockConditions` Struct):** Vaults aren't just time-locked. They can require a combination of:
    *   `unlockTime`: A standard time lock.
    *   `minReputation`: A threshold based on the user's internal reputation score.
    *   `zkProofConditionHash`: A hash representing parameters for a required Zero-Knowledge Proof. The user must provide a valid proof later via `provideZKProof`. This simulates verifying off-chain secrets or computations without revealing them.
    *   `dataConditionHash`: A hash representing parameters for external data verification (e.g., signing a message with a specific key, confirming an off-chain event). The user must provide data and a signature via `provideDataConditionProof`, which calls a hypothetical oracle.

2.  **ZK Proof & Oracle Simulation (`provideZKProof`, `provideDataConditionProof`, `zkProofVerifierContract`, `dataConditionOracle`):** This contract *doesn't* implement ZK proof verification or oracle interaction itself. Instead, it *simulates* calling out to hypothetical external contracts (`zkProofVerifierContract`, `dataConditionOracle`). This demonstrates how a smart contract *could* integrate with these technologies by trusting the verification result from a designated oracle or verifier contract. The `bytes32` hashes act as placeholders for specific proof circuits or data conditions.

3.  **Internal Reputation System (`userReputation`, `penalizeReputation`, `rewardReputation`, `getUserReputation`):** A simple mapping tracks a numerical reputation score for each user. The `minReputation` in unlock conditions directly interacts with this score. Admin functions (`penalizeReputation`, `rewardReputation`) allow manual adjustments, which could be extended to include automated reputation changes based on contract interactions (e.g., successfully meeting complex conditions boosts reputation).

4.  **Dynamic Status Transitions (`VaultStatus` Enum, `requestConditionalUnlock`, `_checkAndTransitionStatus`):** Vaults move through distinct states (`Locked`, `PendingZKProof`, `PendingDataProof`, `ConditionalUnlockReady`, `Open`, `Claimed`, `Cancelled`). The `requestConditionalUnlock` function allows the user to trigger a check and transition the vault's state based on which conditions are met or pending. The internal `_checkAndTransitionStatus` is called after fulfilling specific proof requirements.

5.  **Delegated Access (`delegateAccess`, `revokeDelegateAccess`, `onlyAdminOrDelegate`, `getDelegatee`, `getDelegateeExpiry`):** Vault owners can grant another address temporary permission to withdraw the vault's contents using `delegateAccess`. This delegation can be time-limited. The `attemptWithdraw` function checks if the caller is either the owner or a currently valid delegatee using the `onlyAdminOrDelegate` modifier.

6.  **Associated Data Hash (`associatedDataHash`, `updateAssociatedDataHash`):** Allows associating an arbitrary hash with a vault. This hash can refer to off-chain data (like encrypted documents, IPFS hashes, etc.) that might be related to the conditions or the contents of the vault. The hash itself is public, but the data it points to would be off-chain, potentially requiring the vault conditions (e.g., a ZK proof of decryption knowledge) to be met before the data is revealed off-chain.

7.  **Conditional Cancellation (`cancelDeposit`):** Allows the vault owner to cancel a deposit and retrieve funds under specific circumstances (e.g., within a short grace period, or if the vault has been stuck pending complex proofs for a long time), potentially with a reputation cost. This adds flexibility but prevents arbitrary cancellation.

8.  **Admin Overrides (`updateVaultStatusAdmin`, `penalizeReputation`, `rewardReputation`):** The contract owner has powerful functions to manage supported tokens, adjust reputation, and even force vault status changes. This provides a backdoor/emergency mechanism but centralizes significant control (as is typical with `Ownable`).

9.  **Unique Vault IDs:** A simple counter (`vaultCounter`) ensures each deposit gets a unique ID, allowing users to manage multiple vaults. A mapping (`userVaultIds`) helps track which vaults belong to which user.
    *   **Note on `_resolveVaultOwner`:** The original thought process highlighted a potential inefficiency in resolving the owner from a `vaultId` if the data isn't structured correctly. The final code includes a `vaultIdToOwner` mapping to address this efficiently, ensuring that accessing vault details by ID is performant.

This contract demonstrates a fusion of advanced concepts like conditional logic based on external proofs (simulated), privacy-preserving ideas (ZK-inspired), and internal state management (reputation, status transitions), going beyond typical token or NFT contracts.
