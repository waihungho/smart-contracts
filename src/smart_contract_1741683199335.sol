 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG).
 *      This contract enables artists to mint and list their digital artworks (NFTs),
 *      collectors to purchase and interact with art, and a decentralized governance
 *      system (DAO) to manage the gallery operations, exhibitions, and community features.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core NFT Functionality (ERC721 based):**
 *    - mintArt(string memory _uri): Allows artists to mint new artworks (NFTs).
 *    - transferArt(address _to, uint256 _tokenId): Standard NFT transfer function.
 *    - approveArt(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId): Standard NFT approval function.
 *    - getArtOwner(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves the owner of an artwork.
 *    - getArtUri(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves the URI associated with an artwork.
 *
 * **2. Art Listing and Marketplace Functions:**
 *    - listArtForSale(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price): Artists list their artworks for sale.
 *    - purchaseArt(uint256 _tokenId): Collectors purchase listed artworks.
 *    - cancelArtListing(uint256 _tokenId): Artists cancel their artwork listing.
 *    - setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage): DAO function to set the gallery commission fee.
 *    - withdrawGalleryFees(): DAO function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 *
 * **3. Decentralized Governance (DAO) Functions:**
 *    - proposeNewCurator(address _curatorAddress): DAO members propose a new curator.
 *    - voteOnCuratorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): DAO members vote on curator proposals.
 *    - setExhibitionTheme(string memory _theme): DAO function to set the current exhibition theme.
 *    - proposeArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _tokenId): DAO members propose artworks for exhibition.
 *    - voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): DAO members vote on exhibition proposals.
 *    - addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _tokenId): Curator function to add artwork to the current exhibition (after DAO approval).
 *    - removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _tokenId): Curator function to remove artwork from the exhibition.
 *
 * **4. Community and Engagement Functions:**
 *    - donateToGallery(): Allow users to donate to the gallery's community fund.
 *    - getGalleryBalance(): View the current balance of the gallery's community fund.
 *    - setRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _percentage): DAO function to set royalty percentage for artists on secondary sales.
 *    - withdrawArtistRoyalties(uint256 _tokenId): Artists can withdraw accumulated royalties for their artwork.
 *    - reportArtwork(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _reason): Users can report inappropriate or rule-breaking artworks.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts & Trendy Features:**
 * - **Decentralized Governance (DAO):** Community-driven management of gallery operations, curators, and exhibitions.
 * - **Dynamic Exhibitions:**  DAO-voted themes and curated collections that change over time.
 * - **Community Fund & Donations:**  Supports gallery sustainability and potential artist grants.
 * - **Artist Royalties:**  Ensures artists benefit from secondary market sales, promoting creator economy.
 * - **Artwork Reporting:**  Mechanism for community moderation and maintaining gallery standards.
 * - **On-chain Provenance & Authenticity (inherent in NFTs):**  Leverages blockchain's transparency and security.
