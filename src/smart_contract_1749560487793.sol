Okay, here is a smart contract concept combining several advanced and trendy features: a Decentralized Conditional Prediction Market with a Reputation-Based Oracle & Dispute System.

This contract allows users to:
1.  Create prediction markets that are *conditional* on the outcome of other markets.
2.  Bet on outcomes using ERC-20 tokens.
3.  Users can *report* outcomes for markets after they close.
4.  Other users can *challenge* reported outcomes by staking tokens.
5.  A dispute system relies on participants staking tokens and having reputation. Winning disputes awards reputation and stake; losing slashes reputation and stake.
6.  Market creators and the protocol earn fees.
7.  Features a basic reputation system tied to dispute participation.

This design incorporates:
*   **Conditional Logic:** Markets dependent on others.
*   **Staked Oracles/Reporting:** Incentivizing correct reporting.
*   **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:** Community-driven outcome finalization.
*   **Reputation System:** Gamifying participation and adding Sybil resistance/incentives.
*   **ERC-20 Support:** Flexibility in betting currency.
*   **Pausable/Ownable:** Standard administrative controls.
*   **Batching:** For betting efficiency.

Function Summary:

Admin Functions:
- constructor(): Initializes the contract with owner and fee recipient.
- pauseContract(): Pauses contract operations (owner only).
- unpauseContract(): Unpauses contract operations (owner only).
- setFeeRecipient(): Sets the address receiving protocol fees (owner only).
- setProtocolFeeBasisPoints(): Sets the protocol fee percentage (owner only).
- setMarketCreatorFeeBasisPoints(): Sets the percentage of protocol fees allocated to market creators (owner only).

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Conditional Markets:** `createConditionalMarket` introduces dependency. A market is created but remains in a `Closed` state (`MarketState.Closed`) until its `parentMarketId` is `Finalized` (`MarketState.Finalized`) AND its `finalOutcomeIndex` matches the `requiredParentOutcomeIndex`. Betting on a conditional market is only possible if this condition is met AND the conditional market's `closeTime` hasn't passed. This adds a layer of complex market structures.
2.  **Staked Reporting:** Users must `stakeForReporting` a certain amount (`reportingStakeRequirement`) to be eligible to `reportOutcome`. This stake is locked (`userLockedReportingStake`) when they report. This incentivizes honest reporting as stake is at risk.
3.  **Reputation System:** `userReputation` tracks a score. A minimum score (`minimumReputationForReporting`) is required to report. Reputation is awarded (`_awardReputation`) for winning disputes and slashed (`_slashReputation`) for losing disputes. This creates an on-chain identity/credential tied to reliable participation in the oracle/dispute system.
4.  **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:**
    *   A `reportOutcome` can be `challengeOutcome`d within a time window (`disputeRoundDuration`).
    *   Challenging requires a higher stake (`challengeStakeMultiplier`) than reporting.
    *   Users can `supportOutcome` on either the reporter's or challenger's side by staking.
    *   `finalizeDisputeRound` determines the round winner based on the total stake pooled on each side (`totalReporterSupportStake` vs `totalChallengerStake`).
    *   Winning a dispute round validates the winner's stance (reporter's outcome or challenger's invalidation of the report).
    *   Stakes from the losing side are meant to be distributed among the winning side (though the explicit claiming logic for this required more complex state tracking and was left as a note).
    *   Reputation is adjusted based on the dispute outcome.
5.  **Batch Betting:** `batchPlaceBets` allows users to place multiple bets in a single transaction, saving gas costs compared to individual `placeBet` calls.
6.  **Dynamic Fees (Partial):** While the fees (`protocolFeeBasisPoints`, `marketCreatorFeeBasisPoints`) are set by the owner, the structure allows splitting protocol fees with the market creator (`marketCreatorFeeAmount`). A more advanced version could make these fees dynamic based on market parameters or volume, but the current setup lays the groundwork.
7.  **Modular Structure:** Uses enums, structs, and helper functions (`_calculateWinnings`, `_transferTokens`, `_lockReportingStake`, etc.) for better organization and readability.

**Missing/Simplified Aspects (Important Notes for Production):**

*   **Gas Optimization:** Many parts, especially view functions iterating over lists or complex calculations, could be optimized for gas. Storing total stakes per outcome and total pool helps, but managing dispute stakes per user per round adds complexity.
*   **Security:** This is a conceptual example. Production code requires rigorous audits, including reentrancy checks, overflow/underflow prevention (though Solidity 0.8 helps), access control, and front-running risks. The `_transferTokens` uses basic checks but might need reentrancy guards depending on usage.
*   **Oracle Source:** The contract relies on users reporting outcomes. It assumes honest participants are incentivized by stake and reputation. A real system might integrate with external oracle networks (like Chainlink, Tellor, etc.) or use more sophisticated Schelling point mechanisms.
*   **Dispute Complexity:** The dispute system is simplified (single challenge phase determining reporter win/lose). Real systems often have multi-round disputes, escalating stakes, and potentially decentralized voting or juries. The claiming of dispute stakes also needs robust state management per user per round.
*   **ERC-20 Handling:** Assumes standard ERC-20 behavior. Some tokens have non-standard implementations (fee-on-transfer, rebasing) that can cause issues.
*   **Error Handling:** Uses custom errors (Solidity 0.8+), which is good practice.
*   **Initial Stake Tracking:** The initial market creator stake is not stored in the struct, making the `claimMarketStake` function incomplete.
*   **Getting All Supported Tokens:** Returning all keys of a mapping directly is not possible. A side array or different state structure is needed for the `getSupportedTokens` view.
*   **Fee Withdrawal:** Fee withdrawal logic needs to account for fees accumulated per token.

This contract provides a solid foundation demonstrating how to combine conditional markets, staked reporting, and a reputation-based dispute system, hitting the requirements for advanced and creative concepts with a substantial number of functions.
