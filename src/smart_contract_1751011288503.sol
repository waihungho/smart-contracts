Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Decentralized Autonomous Property DAO (DAP-DAO)".

This contract aims to be interesting and advanced by combining several concepts:
1.  **Tokenized Real-World Assets (Conceptual):** While the contract interacts with token interfaces, it's designed around the *idea* of governing unique property tokens (like ERC721).
2.  **Complex DAO Governance:** Includes proposals, voting (with delegated power), quorum, thresholds, and execution of arbitrary calls.
3.  **Staking & Membership Tiers:** Users stake a governance token to gain voting power and potentially membership benefits.
4.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Specific roles for administrative tasks, distinct from general member governance.
5.  **On-chain Property Registry (DAO's view):** Tracks properties owned by the DAO contract itself.
6.  **Treasury Management:** Handles funds received (e.g., hypothetical rent, sale proceeds) via proposals.
7.  **Pausability:** Standard safety feature.

It avoids directly copying standard OpenZeppelin or common tutorial examples by integrating these features into a specific, somewhat unique use case (a DAO collectively owning/managing properties) and implementing the core logic directly within this single contract (rather than inheriting large standard modules directly, though it interacts with standard token *interfaces*).

    // ====================================================================
    //                     OUTLINE & FUNCTION SUMMARY
    // ====================================================================
    // 1. State Variables & Constants: Core configurations, token addresses, mappings for members,
    //    proposals, properties, and roles.
    // 2. Enums: Define states for proposals and membership tiers.
    // 3. Events: Log key actions for transparency and tracking.
    // 4. Roles: Define custom roles for specific permissions.
    // 5. Modifiers: Custom access control modifiers.
    // 6. Interfaces: Define interfaces for interacting with DAPG (ERC20) and DAPP (ERC721) tokens.
    // 7. Proposal Struct: Defines the structure of a governance proposal.
    // 8. Membership Struct: Defines the structure of a member's data.
    // 9. Constructor: Initializes the DAO with necessary addresses and parameters.
    // 10. Core DAO Functions:
    //     - `submitProposal`: Creates a new proposal.
    //     - `vote`: Allows members to cast a vote on a proposal.
    //     - `executeProposal`: Executes a passed proposal's actions.
    //     - `cancelProposal`: Allows proposer or admin to cancel a pending proposal.
    //     - `getProposalState`: Returns the current state of a proposal.
    //     - `getProposalVotes`: Returns vote counts for a proposal.
    //     - `getProposalDetails`: Returns all key details of a proposal.
    //     - `canExecuteProposal`: Checks if a proposal is in a state ready for execution.
    //     - `simulateProposalExecution`: Allows simulating proposal execution calls (read-only).
    // 11. Membership & Staking Functions:
    //     - `addMember`: Adds a new address as a member (requires staking).
    //     - `removeMember`: Removes an address as a member (requires unstaking).
    //     - `isMember`: Checks if an address is a member.
    //     - `stakeDAPG`: Stakes DAPG tokens to gain voting power/membership benefits.
    //     - `unstakeDAPG`: Unstakes DAPG tokens, reducing voting power/membership.
    //     - `delegateVote`: Delegates voting power to another member.
    //     - `undelegateVote`: Removes voting delegation.
    //     - `getVotingPower`: Calculates an address's current voting power.
    //     - `updateMembershipTier`: Admin function to change a member's tier.
    //     - `getMembershipTier`: Gets the membership tier of an address.
    // 12. Property Management Functions (DAO's View):
    //     - `getDAOOwnedProperties`: Lists DAPP token IDs currently held by the DAO contract.
    //     - `isDAOOwnedPropertyTokenId`: Checks if a specific DAPP token ID is held by the DAO.
    //     - `getDAOOwnedPropertyCount`: Gets the number of properties owned by the DAO.
    //     (Note: Acquisition/Disposal happens via `executeProposal` calling ERC721 transfer functions)
    // 13. Treasury & Finance Functions:
    //     - `depositETH`: Allows sending ETH to the DAO treasury.
    //     - `depositERC20`: Allows sending ERC20 tokens to the DAO treasury.
    //     - `getTreasuryBalanceETH`: Gets the ETH balance of the DAO contract.
    //     - `getTreasuryBalanceERC20`: Gets the balance of a specific ERC20 in the DAO treasury.
    //     (Note: Spending/Distribution happens via `executeProposal` calling transfer functions)
    // 14. Role & Admin Functions:
    //     - `grantRole`: Grants a specific role to an address.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Functions:**

1.  **Tokenized Property Focus (`dappToken`, `ERC721Holder`, `onERC721Received`, Property Tracking):**
    *   The contract is built around the concept of owning specific ERC721 tokens (`dappToken`) that represent properties.
    *   It inherits `ERC721Holder` to specifically enable the contract to receive these tokens.
    *   `onERC721Received` is implemented to automatically *track* the `tokenId` of incoming properties in the `_daoOwnedPropertyTokenIds` array and `_isDAOOwnedPropertyTokenId` mapping. This provides an on-chain registry *within the DAO contract itself* of the assets it holds. This is more specific than just being able to hold NFTs; it actively registers the properties it intends to manage.

2.  **Delegated Voting Power (`delegateVote`, `undelegateVote`, `getVotingPower`):**
    *   Instead of simple 1-token-1-vote, members can delegate their voting power (derived from their staked DAPG) to another member.
    *   `getVotingPower` includes logic to follow this delegation chain, accumulating the staked power at the end of the chain. This encourages participation by allowing members who lack time to vote to delegate their influence.

3.  **Membership Tiers (`MembershipTier`, `updateMembershipTier`, `getMembershipTier`):**
    *   Introduces different levels of membership (`Associate`, `Senior`, `Council`) potentially granting different benefits (though only the tier itself is stored; actual benefits would be implemented elsewhere or checked off-chain).
    *   `updateMembershipTier` allows admins to manage these tiers, adding a layer of structured membership beyond just holding tokens.

4.  **Stake-Based Proposal Threshold (`proposalThreshold`, `stakeDAPG`, `unstakeDAPG`, `getVotingPower`):**
    *   Requires members to have a minimum *effective* voting power (from staking and delegation) to submit proposals, preventing spam.
    *   Staking and unstaking directly impact voting power.

5.  **Flexible Proposal Execution (`targets`, `values`, `calldatas`, `executeProposal`, `simulateProposalExecution`):**
    *   Proposals aren't limited to predefined actions (like just sending ETH). They can propose *arbitrary calls* to any contract (`targets`, `calldatas`) and even send ETH (`values`).
    *   `executeProposal` uses low-level `call` to perform these actions. This allows the DAO to interact with other DeFi protocols, manage diverse property types (calling functions on specific DAPP token contracts, like `setRentalStatus` or `initiateMaintenance`), distribute funds, upgrade other contracts (if targets are proxy admin contracts), etc.
    *   `simulateProposalExecution` provides a read-only way to test if the proposed actions would succeed, increasing confidence before execution.

6.  **Internal Property Tracking Limitations (Discussed in comments):** The contract highlights a practical complexity: automatically tracking properties *leaving* the contract when triggered by a generic `executeProposal` call is difficult. This forces the DAO to potentially include a second step in 'dispose' proposals to manually update its internal property registry, or rely on the external `dappToken.ownerOf()` check (which is gas-intensive for view functions). This isn't necessarily advanced code, but it's a realistic detail encountered in such designs, making the example more practical than purely theoretical.

This contract provides a robust framework for a DAO managing tokenized properties, incorporating several advanced features beyond basic voting, while attempting to be non-duplicative of standard template code by combining these features in a specific application. Remember that deploying such a contract requires careful consideration of gas costs, security audits, and defining the specifics of the `DAPG` and `DAPP` token contracts it interacts with. Circular delegation in `getVotingPower` is a known attack vector in simple delegation models and would require mitigation in a production system.
