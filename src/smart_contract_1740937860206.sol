/**
 * @title Decentralized Social Impact Bonds (DSIB) Platform
 * @author Bard (Large Language Model)
 * @dev This contract facilitates the issuance, management, and execution of Decentralized Social Impact Bonds (DSIBs).
 *      DSIBs leverage blockchain technology for transparent and efficient social impact financing, connecting investors, 
 *      service providers, and outcome funders in a decentralized manner.  This version incorporates a novel "Dynamic Impact Vesting"
 *      mechanism where service provider token unlocks are dynamically adjusted based on verified real-world impact data.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **Bond Issuance:** Allows funders to create new DSIBs with specific outcome metrics, service providers, and investment terms.
 * 2.  **Service Provider Participation:** Enables service providers to register and commit to achieving the defined outcomes.
 * 3.  **Investment:** Allows investors to invest funds into the DSIB, receiving tokens representing their stake.
 * 4.  **Impact Measurement and Verification:**  Integrates with Chainlink or similar oracles to receive verified impact data.
 * 5.  **Dynamic Impact Vesting:** Implements a dynamic vesting schedule for service providers, where their vested tokens unlock based on the 
 *      verified impact data received from oracles.  Higher impact leads to faster vesting.
 * 6.  **Outcome Payment:**  Automatically distributes payments to investors and service providers upon successful outcome verification.
 * 7.  **Governance (Optional):** Could include a governance mechanism for dispute resolution and parameter adjustments (not implemented here for brevity).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *  - `createBond()`: Creates a new DSIB.
 *  - `registerServiceProvider()`: Allows service providers to register for a specific DSIB.
 *  - `invest()`: Allows investors to invest in a DSIB.
 *  - `reportImpact()`: Allows authorized reporters to submit impact data (simulated, for demonstration).
 *  - `updateOracleAddress()`: Allows the owner to update the Chainlink oracle address.
 *  - `claimVestedTokens()`: Allows service providers to claim their dynamically vested tokens.
 *  - `getVestedAmount()`: Returns the amount of tokens that are currently vested for a service provider.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts:**
 *  - **Dynamic Impact Vesting:** Token unlocking based on real-world impact data, creating strong incentives for successful outcomes.
 *  - **Chainlink Oracle Integration:** Relies on trusted oracles for verifying impact data.  (Simulated in this example).
 *  - **Decentralized Governance (Potential):** Could be extended with DAO-like features for community-driven decision-making.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Impact Vesting:**  The core novelty. `getVestedAmount()` dynamically calculates the amount of tokens a service provider can claim based on the `reportedImpact`. The function scales the vesting linearly between 0 and `impactThreshold`. This provides a strong incentive for the service provider to maximize impact.  If the `reportedImpact` is above the `impactThreshold`, the service provider receives all of their allocated tokens.  If impact is 0, they receive none.

* **Chainlink Oracle Integration (Simulated):**  Crucially, the `reportImpact()` function *simulates* a call from a Chainlink oracle. In a real application, you would use Chainlink's client library to request external data (the impact data) and the oracle would call `reportImpact()` upon fulfillment.  This keeps the contract logic clean and relies on a trusted data source.  The `updateOracleAddress()` function allows the contract owner to change the oracle address if needed (e.g., for upgrades or in case of compromise).  **IMPORTANT:**  This example *does not* implement the actual Chainlink request/response flow.  It is a placeholder for that integration.

* **`claimVestedTokens()` Function:**  This function allows the service provider to actually claim their vested tokens.  It checks the vested amount, ensures that the service provider hasn't already claimed them, and then transfers the tokens.  It uses `serviceProviderVestedTokens` to track how much has already been claimed.  Crucially, `claimVestedTokens` actually transfers the tokens using the ERC-20 `transfer` function.

* **ERC-20 Handling:** The contract now properly handles ERC-20 tokens for investment and payouts. Investors transfer tokens *into* the contract using `impactToken.transferFrom()`.  The contract then pays investors and service providers using `ERC20(impactTokenAddress).transfer()`. This is the correct and standard way to handle ERC-20 tokens in a smart contract.  It also has a check at the invest function to ensure the user have approve the contract to withdraw the investment amount.

* **Bond Struct:** Now include start and end time.
* **`distributeOutcomePayment`** Payment is distributed automatically after Outcome Funder sent the Impact token to the contract.

* **Clear Events:** The contract emits events for all important actions (bond creation, investment, impact reporting, token claiming), making it easier to track and monitor the DSIB platform.

* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to check for common errors and invalid inputs.

* **Ownable:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract to restrict certain functions (e.g., `updateOracleAddress()`) to the contract owner.

* **SafeMath:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library to prevent integer overflow and underflow errors, which can lead to vulnerabilities.

* **No Reentrancy (Implicit):**  Since the contract doesn't make external calls *during* a transfer, it's implicitly protected from reentrancy attacks (although adding explicit reentrancy guards from OpenZeppelin is *always* recommended for production code).

* **Fallback Function:**  Includes a fallback function to prevent accidental Ether transfers, which could lock up funds in the contract.

* **Gas Optimization:** While not heavily optimized for gas, the code is reasonably efficient.  Further gas optimizations could be applied if necessary.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to a test network (like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Goerli) or a local development environment (like Ganache).  Provide the initial `oracleAddress` when deploying.

2.  **Create Bonds:** Call the `createBond()` function to create new DSIBs, specifying the details for each bond. Make sure `_impactToken` is the address of an *already deployed* ERC-20 token.

3.  **Investors Invest:** Investors call the `invest()` function, specifying the `_bondId` and the amount they want to invest.  **Crucially, investors must first approve the DSIB contract to spend their ERC-20 tokens using the `approve()` function on the ERC-20 token contract.**  For example: `impactToken.approve(dsibContractAddress, amountToInvest)`.

4.  **Oracle Reports Impact (Simulated):** The *simulated* oracle (in this example, just you) would call the `reportImpact()` function with the `_bondId` and the verified impact data.

5.  **Service Provider Claims Tokens:** The service provider calls `claimVestedTokens()` to claim their dynamically vested tokens.

6. **Outcome Funder Distributes Payment.** The outcome Funder calls `distributeOutcomePayment()`, ensuring the payment is distributed appropriately.

Remember that this is a simplified example and would require more thorough testing and security auditing before being used in a production environment. Also, the Chainlink oracle integration needs to be implemented fully using the Chainlink client library for a real-world application.
