/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation and Achievement System
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a dynamic reputation and achievement system.
 * It allows for users to earn reputation points and achievements based on various on-chain or off-chain activities
 * (simulated in this contract). Reputation can be increased or decreased by admins or through automated events.
 * Achievements are non-transferable tokens awarded for specific milestones.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1. `getUserReputation(address user)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a given user.
 * 2. `increaseReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Increases the reputation of a user (Admin/Authorized role).
 * 3. `decreaseReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Decreases the reputation of a user (Admin/Authorized role).
 * 4. `setBaseReputation(uint256 baseReputation)`: Sets the initial reputation score for new users (Admin).
 *
 * **Achievement System:**
 * 5. `createAchievement(string memory name, string memory description, string memory imageUrl)`: Creates a new achievement type (Admin).
 * 6. `awardAchievement(address user, uint256 achievementId)`: Awards a specific achievement to a user (Admin/Authorized role or automated event).
 * 7. `revokeAchievement(address user, uint256 achievementId)`: Revokes a previously awarded achievement from a user (Admin).
 * 8. `getUserAchievements(address user)`: Retrieves a list of achievement IDs held by a user.
 * 9. `getAchievementDetails(uint256 achievementId)`: Retrieves details (name, description, image URL) of a specific achievement.
 * 10. `totalSupplyAchievements()`: Returns the total number of achievement types created.
 * 11. `achievementExists(uint256 achievementId)`: Checks if an achievement type exists.
 *
 * **Event-Driven Reputation & Achievements (Simulated Events):**
 * 12. `simulateContentCreation(address user)`: Simulates content creation, increasing user reputation.
 * 13. `simulatePositiveInteraction(address fromUser, address toUser)`: Simulates a positive interaction, rewarding both users with reputation.
 * 14. `simulateNegativeInteraction(address fromUser, address toUser)`: Simulates a negative interaction, decreasing reputation of the initiating user.
 * 15. `simulateMilestoneCompletion(address user, string memory milestoneName)`: Simulates milestone completion, awarding both reputation and a unique achievement.
 *
 * **Governance & Admin Functions:**
 * 16. `addAdmin(address newAdmin)`: Adds a new admin address (Only current admin).
 * 17. `removeAdmin(address adminToRemove)`: Removes an admin address (Only current admin, cannot remove self if only admin).
 * 18. `isAdmin(address account)`: Checks if an address is an admin.
 * 19. `pauseContract()`: Pauses core functionalities of the contract (Admin).
 * 20. `unpauseContract()`: Resumes core functionalities of the contract (Admin).
 * 21. `isPaused()`: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
 * 22. `withdrawContractBalance(address payable recipient)`: Allows admin to withdraw contract's ETH balance (Admin).
 *
 * **Data Structures & Mappings:**
 * - `userReputations`: Mapping to store user reputation scores.
 * - `achievements`: Mapping to store achievement details.
 * - `userAchievements`: Mapping to track achievements awarded to users.
 * - `achievementSupply`: Keeps track of the total number of achievement types.
 * - `admins`: Mapping to store admin addresses.
 * - `paused`: State variable to control contract pausing.
 * - `baseReputation`: Default reputation score for new users.
 *
 * **Events:**
 * - `ReputationIncreased`: Emitted when user reputation is increased.
 * - `ReputationDecreased`: Emitted when user reputation is decreased.
 * - `AchievementCreated`: Emitted when a new achievement type is created.
 * - `AchievementAwarded`: Emitted when an achievement is awarded to a user.
 * - `AchievementRevoked`: Emitted when an achievement is revoked from a user.
 * - `AdminAdded`: Emitted when a new admin is added.
 * - `AdminRemoved`: Emitted when an admin is removed.
 * - `ContractPaused`: Emitted when the contract is paused.
 * - `ContractUnpaused`: Emitted when the contract is unpaused.
 * - `BalanceWithdrawn`: Emitted when contract balance is withdrawn.
