Okay, let's design a smart contract for a decentralized "OmniGuild" â€“ a collective entity where members pool resources, pursue shared objectives (Quests), and govern themselves based on earned reputation and owned Member NFTs.

This concept incorporates:
*   **Decentralized Governance:** Reputation-weighted voting on proposals.
*   **Collective Asset Management:** A treasury for guild-owned ERC20 and ERC721 assets managed via governance.
*   **Reputation System:** Earned through participation and contributions.
*   **Quest System:** Defined objectives with pooled rewards, requiring member participation.
*   **Member NFTs:** Representing membership status and potentially conferring unique benefits (handled externally but integrated).
*   **Dynamic Parameters:** Core guild settings can be adjusted via governance.

It avoids being a simple clone of standard ERC20/ERC721, basic staking, or typical DeFi vaults by integrating these elements into a unique organizational structure focused on collaborative goals.

**OmniGuild Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Define structs for MemberInfo, Proposal, and Quest. Define mappings and variables to store guild state, members, proposals, quests, and assets.
2.  **Events:** Define events for key actions (joining, leaving, proposals, votes, quests, asset management).
3.  **Errors:** Define custom errors for better revert reasons.
4.  **Modifiers:** Define modifiers for access control and state checks.
5.  **Constructor:** Initialize the contract, set the initial administrator and parameters.
6.  **Membership Functions:** Handle joining, leaving, and managing members.
7.  **Asset Management Functions:** Handle depositing and withdrawing ERC20 and ERC721 assets from the guild treasury (withdrawals require governance).
8.  **Reputation System Functions:** Handle awarding and penalizing reputation (primarily internal/governance).
9.  **Governance Functions:** Handle creating proposals, voting, and executing approved proposals.
10. **Quest System Functions:** Handle creating, starting, participating in, and distributing rewards for quests.
11. **Parameter Configuration:** Functions to update guild parameters via governance.
12. **View Functions:** Provide read-only access to guild state and member information.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the guild with basic parameters and the initial administrator.
2.  `joinGuild()`: Allows a user to join the guild by paying the membership fee and potentially minting a Member NFT.
3.  `leaveGuild()`: Allows a member to voluntarily leave the guild (may incur a reputation penalty).
4.  `kickMember(address member)`: Governance function to remove a member.
5.  `depositAsset(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows any address to deposit ERC20 tokens into the guild treasury.
6.  `depositNFT(address nftAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows any address to deposit an ERC721 token into the guild treasury.
7.  `withdrawAsset(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, address recipient)`: Internal/Governance function to withdraw ERC20 from the treasury.
8.  `withdrawNFT(address nftAddress, uint256 tokenId, address recipient)`: Internal/Governance function to withdraw ERC721 from the treasury.
9.  `createProposal(string calldata description, address[] calldata targets, bytes[] calldata calldatas)`: Allows members meeting the reputation threshold to create a governance proposal.
10. `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Allows members to cast a vote on an active proposal, weighted by their reputation.
11. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows anyone to execute a proposal after its voting period ends, provided it met quorum and majority.
12. `createQuest(string calldata title, string calldata description, bytes32 goalIdentifier, uint256 requiredReputation, address[] calldata rewardTokens, uint256[] calldata rewardAmounts)`: Allows members/admins to define a new quest template.
13. `startQuest(uint256 questId)`: Admin/Governance function to activate a created quest and allocate rewards from the treasury.
14. `submitQuestParticipationProof(uint256 questId, bytes calldata proof)`: Allows a member to submit proof of participation in an active quest, earning reputation specific to that quest.
15. `distributeQuestRewards(uint256 questId)`: Admin/Governance function to distribute pooled rewards among participants of a completed quest based on their participation reputation.
16. `awardReputation(address member, uint256 amount)`: Internal/Governance function to increase a member's reputation.
17. `penalizeReputation(address member, uint256 amount)`: Internal/Governance function to decrease a member's reputation.
18. `updateGovernanceParameters(uint256 newQuorumPercent, uint256 newVotePeriod, uint256 newMinReputationToPropose)`: Governance function to adjust core governance settings.
19. `updateMemberFee(uint256 newFee)`: Governance function to adjust the guild membership fee.
20. `setMemberNFTContract(address nftContract)`: Admin/Governance function to set or update the address of the associated Member NFT contract.
21. `getMemberInfo(address member)`: View function to retrieve a member's information.
22. `getProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: View function to retrieve proposal details.
23. `getQuest(uint256 questId)`: View function to retrieve quest details.
24. `getGuildERC20Balance(address tokenAddress)`: View function to check the guild's ERC20 balance.
25. `getGuildNFTCount(address nftAddress)`: View function to count the number of NFTs of a specific type held by the guild.
26. `isMember(address account)`: View function to check if an address is an active member.
27. `getCurrentVotingPower(address member)`: View function to get a member's current voting power (based on reputation).
28. `getQuestParticipantReputation(uint256 questId, address member)`: View function to get reputation earned by a member within a specific quest.
29. `getTotalMembers()`: View function to get the total count of active members.
30. `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: View function to determine the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed, Executed).

             // Need to calculate this sum. This is inefficient on-chain without a list or running total.
             // **Final Simplification for Example:** TotalVotingPower = a fixed base * totalActiveMembers. Quorum is % of this. Vote weight is member's rep.
             // This is still not ideal. The most common approach is snapshotting total voting power (e.g., token supply) at creation.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Integrated Systems:** Combines Membership, Asset Management, Governance, and Quests into a single organizational structure, rather than separate, loosely connected contracts.
2.  **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Voting power is tied to a member's earned reputation within the guild, moving beyond simple 1-member-1-vote or fixed token weighting.
3.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Critical contract parameters (member fee, quorum, vote period, proposal threshold) can be changed *by governance* itself, allowing the guild to evolve its own rules.
4.  **Internal/External Asset Management:** The contract acts as a treasury (`guildERC20Balances`, `guildNFTCounts`), but withdrawals require governance approval (executed via internal helper functions like `withdrawAsset`). NFT handling uses `ERC721Holder`.
5.  **Quest Lifecycle:** Quests have distinct states (`Created`, `Active`, `Completed`). Rewards are pooled and distributed based on *participation-specific* reputation (`participantReputationEarned`), separating general guild standing from contribution to a specific goal.
6.  **Flexible Quest Goals:** The `goalIdentifier` (bytes32) allows quests to represent diverse objectives â€“ could be a hash of off-chain requirements, an ID referring to an external system, etc. The verification logic for achieving the goal happens outside `submitQuestParticipationProof` (likely off-chain/oracle) and triggers the `distributeQuestRewards` step via admin/governance.
7.  **Conceptual Dynamic NFTs:** The `memberNFTContract` and `memberNFTId` fields conceptually link members to external NFTs that could represent their status or achievements, potentially changing based on their reputation or completed quests. The `joinGuild` and `leaveGuild` functions include placeholder calls for minting/burning these (requires the NFT contract to support these calls from the guild).
8.  **`call` for Governance Execution:** The `executeProposal` function uses low-level `call` to execute arbitrary functions on target contracts, allowing governance to interact with external protocols or manage the guild's internal state in flexible ways. Includes basic success check.
9.  **`Ownable2Step` and Transition to DAO:** Uses `Ownable2Step` initially, but the intention is that governance proposals would eventually control critical functions (like parameter updates or kicking members), potentially even transferring ownership away from the initial admin to a timelock or multi-sig governed by the DAO.
10. **Error Handling:** Uses custom errors (`error Guild__...`) for clearer revert reasons.
11. **`ReentrancyGuard`:** Protects functions that involve external calls (like token transfers) from reentrancy attacks.

**Limitations and Further Development:**

*   **Reputation Snapshot:** The `_getTotalActiveReputationSnapshot()` function is a conceptual placeholder. Efficiently calculating the sum of all active members' reputation for quorum requires careful state management (e.g., a running total updated on rep changes and member status changes) or iterating a list of members, which is complex/gas-intensive on-chain. A real DAO often snapshots token balances instead.
*   **NFT Ownership Tracking:** The `guildNFTCounts` mapping only tracks the *number* of NFTs of a given address. To enable `withdrawNFT` via governance for a *specific* `tokenId`, the contract needs a more complex way to track individual token IDs it owns (e.g., an array per NFT contract, requiring dynamic array management).
*   **Proof Verification:** The `bytes calldata proof` in `submitQuestParticipationProof` is just data storage. The *verification* logic for this proof and the determination of `reputationAwardedForProof` is not implemented and would depend heavily on the nature of the quest (e.g., integration with an oracle, a specific on-chain game state, etc.).
*   **Participants List:** Distributing quest rewards efficiently requires a list of participants who submitted proof, not just checking a map for all possible members. A `participantsList` array would need to be added to the `Quest` struct and managed in `submitQuestParticipationProof`.
*   **Gas Efficiency:** Iterating over large numbers of members or participants (even conceptually in comments) can be gas-prohibitive. Real-world DAOs and complex systems often rely on off-chain indexing or different data structures.
*   **Security Audits:** This is a complex contract with many interconnected parts and external calls (`call`). It requires extensive testing and professional security audits before production deployment.

This contract provides a framework for a sophisticated decentralized organization, demonstrating how various common DeFi and DAO primitives can be combined in a novel way to create a dynamic, community-driven entity.
