Okay, let's create a smart contract that leverages a concept inspired by quantum mechanics â€“ a "Superposition Vault". The idea is that the vault's unlock state isn't simply boolean (locked/unlocked) but exists in a "superposed" state until a specific set of external and internal conditions are "observed" or "measured," causing the state to "collapse" into either an unlocked state or a permanently locked/penalized state.

This concept uses:
1.  **Superposition:** The vault is configured with multiple potential states determined by various factors.
2.  **Observation/Measurement:** A specific transaction or event triggers the "collapse" of the state based on current conditions and external "pulses".
3.  **Entanglement (Simulated):** The state of the vault can be linked to other simulated factors or addresses, influencing the collapse outcome.
4.  **Quantum Randomness (Simulated):** Incorporating a seed derived from block data or a VRF oracle (though a full VRF integration is complex for this example, we'll simulate its role).

It's important to note that this is a *metaphor* and *simulation* of quantum principles using classical computation (Solidity). It does not use actual quantum effects.

/*
Function Summary:

// --- State Configuration (Owner Only) ---
- constructor(address initialOwner, bytes32 initialTargetUnlockHash): Initializes the contract, sets owner and the target hash for successful collapse.
- setSuperpositionFactor(string memory factorName, uint256 value): Sets a numerical value for a named superposition factor. These contribute to the state hash calculation.
- setObservationCondition(string memory conditionName, bool requiredState): Sets a boolean condition that must be met during observation for successful unlock.
- setTargetUnlockHash(bytes32 newTargetUnlockHash): Sets the specific hash value that signals a successful unlock upon observation.
- setObservationPulseSource(address source): Specifies an address that, when calling `initiateObservation`, might provide a trusted 'pulse' or seed. (Simplified for this example).
- setPenaltyAddress(address payable _penaltyAddress): Sets the address where penalty funds are sent if the vault collapses to the locked/penalized state.
- addEntanglementLink(address linkedAddress): Registers an address as 'entangled'. The state of these links can influence `triggerEntanglementEffect`.
- removeEntanglementLink(address linkedAddress): Deregisters an 'entangled' address.
- lockVaultSetup(): Finalizes initial configuration, moving the vault towards the `Superposed` state (requires `initiateSuperposition` to fully enter).

// --- Lifecycle Management ---
- initiateSuperposition(): Transitions the vault from `Configuring` to `Superposed`. Requires setup to be locked. Allows deposits in this state.
- initiateObservation(bytes32 observationPulse): The critical function. Triggers the state collapse from `Superposed`. Takes an external `observationPulse` (e.g., block hash, VRF result, user data) to influence the collapse outcome. Checks factors, conditions, and calculates the resulting state hash. Transitions to `CollapsedUnlocked` or `CollapsedLocked`.
- resetSuperposition(bytes32 newSuperpositionSeed): Allows resetting the vault back to the `Superposed` state from `CollapsedLocked` *under specific, pre-defined conditions* (e.g., owner call, time delay since collapse, using a new seed). (Conditions simplified here).

// --- User Interactions ---
- deposit() payable: Allows users to deposit Ether into the vault while it is in the `Superposed` state.
- withdraw(): Allows the owner (or designated recipient) to withdraw Ether from the vault, *only if* the state is `CollapsedUnlocked`.

// --- State-Triggered Actions ---
- punishVault(): Can be called when the state is `CollapsedLocked`. Sends a percentage of the vault's balance to the `penaltyAddress`. Can be called by anyone, but only effective in `CollapsedLocked` state.
- triggerEntanglementEffect(address linkedAddress, bytes32 effectData): A simulated function. If the `linkedAddress` is registered as 'entangled' and the vault is in a valid state, calling this can *simulate* an internal effect or state change based on `effectData` and current superposition factors. Doesn't transfer funds, just updates internal flags or values.

// --- Information / Query (View/Pure) ---
- getVaultState() view: Returns the current state of the vault (Configuring, Superposed, CollapsedUnlocked, CollapsedLocked).
- getSuperpositionFactor(string memory factorName) view: Returns the value of a specific superposition factor.
- getObservationCondition(string memory conditionName) view: Returns the boolean state of a specific observation condition.
- getTargetUnlockHash() view: Returns the target hash required for successful unlock collapse.
- getObservationPulseSource() view: Returns the address designated as the observation pulse source.
- getPenaltyAddress() view: Returns the address designated to receive penalties.
- checkEntanglementLink(address linkedAddress) view: Checks if an address is registered as 'entangled'.
- getContractBalance() view: Returns the current Ether balance held by the contract.
- getRequiredFactors() view: Returns a list of all defined superposition factor names. (Simplified return type).
- getObservationResults() view: Returns the results of the most recent `initiateObservation` call (calculated hash, conditions met, outcome).
- estimateObservationOutcome(bytes32 hypotheticalPulse) view: A pure function that calculates what the resulting state hash *would* be if the vault were observed *right now* with the current configuration and a *hypothetical* `observationPulse`. Useful for testing/simulation *before* actual observation. Does *not* change state.

// --- Ownership (Inherited) ---
- transferOwnership(address newOwner): Transfers contract ownership.
- renounceOwnership(): Renounces contract ownership.

**Explanation of Key Components & Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **State Machine (`VaultState`):** The contract operates through distinct states (`Configuring`, `Superposed`, `CollapsedUnlocked`, `CollapsedLocked`). Functions are guarded by modifiers (`onlyState`, `notState`) to ensure they are called only when the contract is in a valid state for that action. This implements a simple but effective state machine pattern.
2.  **Multi-Factor Configuration:** The `superpositionFactors` and `observationConditions` mappings allow the owner to configure multiple arbitrary named parameters (`string` keys) that influence the state collapse. This makes the unlock condition flexible and complex, going beyond a simple password or single value check.
3.  **Abstract Unlock Condition (Hash Matching & Conditions):** The vault doesn't unlock based on a single event. It requires an "observation" transaction to be called. During this observation, a hash is calculated based on internal factors, external data (`observationPulse`), and blockchain context. This calculated hash must match the `targetUnlockHash`, *AND* all configured `observationConditions` must be `true`. This multi-criteria logic is the core of the "quantum collapse" metaphor.
4.  **External "Pulse" Influence:** The `initiateObservation` function requires an `observationPulse` parameter. This simulates an external factor influencing the state collapse. In a real application, this could be a value from an oracle (like Chainlink VRF for simulated randomness), a data feed, or even a value derived from interaction with another contract.
5.  **Simulated Entanglement:** The `isEntangled` mapping and `triggerEntanglementEffect` function simulate an external influence ("entanglement"). While it doesn't *really* link to another quantum system, it allows specific registered addresses to trigger an internal effect (`entanglementEffectCounter`) which *could* hypothetically be incorporated into future versions or calculations (though it only modifies the counter in this example). This adds a layer of conceptual complexity.
6.  **Configurable Outcome:** The vault can collapse into one of two terminal states: `CollapsedUnlocked` (success, allows withdrawal) or `CollapsedLocked` (failure, allows penalty). This is determined by the outcome of the hash calculation and condition checks.
7.  **Penalty Mechanism:** The `punishVault` function provides a mechanism to handle the `CollapsedLocked` state, allowing a portion of the funds to be directed elsewhere. This adds a consequence for failure in the state collapse.
8.  **Conditional Reset (`resetSuperposition`):** The ability to reset from `CollapsedLocked` adds another layer of complexity and potential recovery mechanism, although the conditions for such a reset would need careful design in a production environment.
9.  **Information/Estimation Functions:** The `view` functions provide visibility into the configuration and state. The `estimateObservationOutcome` function is particularly interesting as it allows callers to *simulate* the observation process with hypothetical inputs and the current configuration *without* changing the contract state. This aids in understanding the conditions needed for a successful collapse.
10. **Mapping Limitations (Noted):** The contract includes helper functions like `getRequiredFactors`. A crucial point in Solidity is that you cannot easily iterate over mapping keys. The implementation here notes this limitation, and a real-world contract needing to retrieve all factor/condition names would require storing them in a separate array alongside the mapping.

This contract provides a unique, conceptually advanced vault mechanism that is not a standard open-source pattern, while incorporating more than 20 functions as requested. Remember that deploying this requires careful consideration of security and the real-world implications of relying on the "observation" logic.
