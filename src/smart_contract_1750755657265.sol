Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract called `QuantumVault`. It aims to be interesting and combine several advanced concepts:

1.  **Complex Time/Condition Locks:** Not just a simple time lock, but combining a primary time lock with secondary conditions (requiring a secret reveal OR an attestation from another address OR a minimum internal trust score).
2.  **Delegated Function Calls:** The owner can delegate the ability to call specific functions (like depositing ERC20 on their behalf, or maybe even setting certain parameters within limits) to another address for a limited time.
3.  **Internal Trust/Reputation:** A simple system where certain actions (like successfully revealing a secret) increase an internal trust score, and others (like a failed reveal or challenge) decrease it. This score can then be used as an unlock condition or potentially for tiered access/limits (though implemented here primarily as an unlock condition).
4.  **Challenge Mechanism:** A period where a revealed secret can be challenged, pausing withdrawals until resolved by the owner.
5.  **ERC20 Support:** Handles both native Ether and a specified ERC20 token.

It's designed to be a secure vault with multiple layers of unlocking requirements, demonstrating complex state management and access control beyond standard patterns.

/**
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * State Management:
 * - constructor(address initialOwner, address initialTokenAddress): Initializes the vault owner and optional ERC20 token.
 * - pause(): Pauses certain operations (Owner only).
 * - unpause(): Unpauses operations (Owner only).
 * - setOwner(address newOwner): Transfers ownership (Owner only).
 *
 * Deposits:
 * - depositEther(): Deposits native Ether into the vault.
 * - depositERC20(uint256 amount): Deposits ERC20 tokens into the vault (requires prior approval).
 *
 * Lock & Condition Setting (Owner only):
 * - setPrimaryUnlockTime(uint40 time): Sets the primary timestamp for vault unlock.
 * - setSecondaryUnlockType(SecondaryConditionType conditionType): Sets the secondary condition required for unlock.
 * - commitSecretHash(bytes32 _secretHash): Commits a hash of a secret that must be revealed later.
 * - setAttestationAddress(address _attestationAddress): Sets the address required to provide attestation.
 * - setRequiredTrustScore(uint256 score): Sets the minimum internal trust score needed for unlock.
 *
 * Fulfilling Conditions:
 * - revealSecret(string memory _secret): Reveals the secret and checks it against the committed hash. (Callable after primary unlock time).
 * - receiveAttestation(): Called by the designated attestation address to fulfill the attestation condition. (Callable after primary unlock time).
 *
 * Internal Trust Management (Internal functions, triggered by other actions):
 * - _increaseTrustScore(address user, uint256 amount): Increases a user's internal trust score.
 * - _decreaseTrustScore(address user, uint256 amount): Decreases a user's internal trust score.
 *
 * Delegation (Owner only):
 * - addAllowedDelegate(address delegate): Allows an address to be a potential delegate.
 * - removeAllowedDelegate(address delegate): Disallows an address from being a delegate.
 * - delegateFunctionCall(address delegate, bytes4 functionSelector, uint256 duration): Delegates the ability to call a specific function selector for a time duration to an allowed delegate.
 * - revokeDelegation(address delegate, bytes4 functionSelector): Revokes a specific delegation immediately.
 *
 * Challenge System:
 * - challengeSecretReveal(address challengedUser): Initiates a challenge against a revealed secret if a valid reason exists (Logic simplified for this example, could be expanded). (Callable by Owner or designated challenger after reveal, before withdrawal).
 * - resolveChallenge(address challengedUser): Owner resolves a challenge, either confirming validity or penalizing. (Owner only).
 *
 * Withdrawal:
 * - withdrawEther(): Withdraws native Ether if all unlock conditions are met and no challenge is active.
 * - withdrawERC20(uint256 amount): Withdraws ERC20 tokens if all unlock conditions are met and no challenge is active.
 * - panicWithdrawOwner(): Allows the owner to withdraw all funds in an emergency, potentially bypassing some locks after a delay. (Owner only, potentially time-delayed).
 *
 * Getters & Information:
 * - getVaultState(): Returns the current overall state of the vault's locks and conditions.
 * - isUnlockConditionMet(): Checks if all primary and secondary unlock conditions are currently met.
 * - checkDelegationStatus(address delegate, bytes4 functionSelector): Checks if a specific function is delegated to an address and is currently active.
 * - getTrustScore(address user): Gets the internal trust score of a user.
 * - getChallengeStatus(address user): Gets the challenge status for a user's secret reveal.
 * - getPrimaryUnlockTime(): Gets the set primary unlock timestamp.
 * - getSecondaryUnlockType(): Gets the type of secondary condition required.
 * - getRequiredTrustScore(): Gets the minimum required trust score.
 * - getAllowedDelegates(): Gets the list of addresses allowed to be delegates.
 * - getChallengeResolutionTime(): Gets the time after which a challenge can be resolved by the owner.
