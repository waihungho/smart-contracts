Okay, let's design a complex, unique smart contract focusing on a decentralized collaborative "Thought Garden" where users can propose, link, nurture, and prune ideas represented as nodes, incentivized by a native token. This incorporates elements of SocialFi, decentralized knowledge graphs, and staking/governance mechanisms.

It won't duplicate standard ERC20, ERC721, or typical DeFi protocols directly, but will build custom logic around similar principles (staking, voting).

---

**Smart Contract Outline: DecentralizedThoughtGarden**

1.  **Purpose:** To create a decentralized, community-curated garden of interconnected ideas or "thoughts". Users contribute nodes (thoughts), link them, stake tokens to "nurture" them, and vote to "prune" undesirable ones. A native token (`NurtureToken`) incentivizes participation.
2.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   **ThoughtNode:** Represents an individual idea/thought (content hash).
    *   **Link:** Represents a connection between two ThoughtNodes.
    *   **Nurturing:** Staking `NurtureToken` on a Node or Link to signal value and earn potential rewards.
    *   **Pruning:** A governance process initiated by staking `NurtureToken`, followed by token-weighted voting to remove a Node.
    *   **Synthesis:** A mechanism (potentially abstract or future-proofed) to create new Nodes based on nurtured parents, distributing rewards.
    *   **Token-Weighted Voting:** Pruning votes are weighted by the voter's `NurtureToken` balance.
    *   **Unstaking Lockup:** Stakes require a time lock before withdrawal.
3.  **Core Components:**
    *   `ThoughtNode` struct
    *   `Link` struct
    *   `UnstakeRequest` struct
    *   `NodeState` enum
    *   `NurtureToken` (internal ERC20-like functionality)
    *   Mapping for nodes, links, stakes, votes, unstake requests.
    *   Governance parameters (thresholds, lockups).
    *   Basic access control (Owner for parameter setting initially).
    *   Snapshot/Checkpointing for voting power.

**Function Summary:**

*   **Node & Link Creation (2 Functions):**
    1.  `createThoughtNode`: Create a new thought node, staking initial `NurtureToken`. Optionally link to parent nodes.
    2.  `linkThoughts`: Create a new link between existing nodes, staking initial `NurtureToken`.
*   **Nurturing & Staking (5 Functions):**
    3.  `nurtureThought`: Add stake to an existing thought node.
    4.  `nurtureLink`: Add stake to an existing link.
    5.  `requestUnstakeNurture`: Initiate an unstake request for stake on a node.
    6.  `requestUnstakeLink`: Initiate an unstake request for stake on a link.
    7.  `withdrawUnstaked`: Complete an unstake request after the lockup period.
*   **Pruning & Voting (6 Functions):**
    8.  `proposePruning`: Stake token to propose a node for pruning.
    9.  `voteOnPruning`: Cast a token-weighted vote (for or against) on a pruning proposal.
    10. `executePruning`: Finalize pruning if the vote threshold is met, transitioning the node state and potentially burning/redistributing stakes.
    11. `claimPruningReward`: Users who successfully voted for pruning claim a share of the pruner's stake or other rewards.
    12. `claimPruningStakeRefund`: The user who proposed pruning gets their stake back if pruning is successful.
    13. `claimPruningStakeSlash`: Users who voted *against* successful pruning get a share of the pruner's slashed stake if pruning *fails*. (Adds complexity & incentive).
*   **Synthesis & Rewards (2 Functions):**
    14. `synthesizeThought`: Create a new node conceptually derived from existing ones, potentially minting tokens and rewarding stakers of parent nodes.
    15. `claimSynthesisReward`: Claim tokens earned from nurturing parent nodes used in a synthesis.
*   **Information & Utility (9 Functions):**
    16. `getNode`: Get details of a specific thought node.
    17. `getLink`: Get details of a specific link.
    18. `getTotalNurtureStakeOnNode`: Get total `NurtureToken` staked on a node.
    19. `getTotalLinkStake`: Get total `NurtureToken` staked on a link.
    20. `getUserNodeStake`: Get a specific user's stake on a node.
    21. `getUserLinkStake`: Get a specific user's stake on a link.
    22. `getNodeState`: Get the current state of a node.
    23. `getPruningVoteCounts`: Get current vote counts (for/against) for a pruning proposal.
    24. `getTokenSupply`: Get total supply of `NurtureToken`.
*   **Governance & Parameter Settings (3 Functions - Owner only initially):**
    25. `setMinCreationStake`: Set the minimum `NurtureToken` required to create a node or link.
    26. `setPruningVoteThreshold`: Set the percentage of total voting power required to prune a node.
    27. `setUnstakeLockupDuration`: Set the time duration for unstake lockup.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Knowledge Graph / SocialFi:** The core concept of nodes representing thoughts and links representing connections creates a graph structure on-chain. Nurturing and pruning are explicit on-chain actions that curate this graph, reflecting community consensus or value. This goes beyond simple token transfers or static NFTs.
2.  **Native Token Incentivization (`NurtureToken`):** A custom token is central to the system, used for:
    *   **Staking:** Required for creation, linking, nurturing, and proposing pruning. This aligns incentives – users stake tokens on what they believe is valuable (nurture) or harmful (prune proposal).
    *   **Token-Weighted Governance:** Pruning votes are weighted by token balance, giving more influence to larger token holders (a common, albeit debated, decentralized governance model).
    *   **Reward Distribution:** Tokens are minted and distributed through the `synthesizeThought` function, rewarding contribution and nurturing of underlying ideas.
3.  **Complex State Management:** The contract manages multiple interconnected data structures: `ThoughtNode`, `Link`, `UnstakeRequest`, `PruningProposal`, along with mappings tracking individual user stakes, proposal votes, and historical voting power. Node states transition (`Active` -> `ProposedForPruning` -> `Pruned` or `Active`).
4.  **Staking with Lockup:** Nurturing stake isn't instantly withdrawable, requiring a time lock (`unstakeLockupDuration`). This encourages longer-term commitment to ideas.
5.  **Pruning Mechanism:** A multi-step governance process (`proposePruning` -> `voteOnPruning` -> `executePruning`) with token-weighted voting and stake consequences (refund/slash) adds a layer of community moderation to the graph.
6.  **Synthesis Concept:** `synthesizeThought` introduces an abstract mechanism for generating new ideas from existing ones, coupled with token minting and reward distribution to parent stakers. This models the generative and collaborative nature of idea formation and provides a source of token supply tied to successful contribution.
7.  **On-chain Voting Power Checkpointing:** The basic implementation of `delegate`, `getCurrentVotes`, and `getPriorVotes` allows checking a user's voting power at a specific past block, which is crucial for consistent and fair token-weighted voting in the pruning process, preventing flashloan governance attacks based on current balance.
8.  **Internal Accounting:** The contract internally tracks not just total stake on a node/link, but also *who* staked *how much* (`userNodeStake`, `userLinkStake`), which is necessary for unstaking and potential future reward distribution mechanisms.
9.  **Reentrancy Guard:** Used to protect against potential reentrancy attacks, especially in functions handling token transfers (`transfer`, `withdrawUnstaked`).
10. **Access Control (`Ownable`):** While a DAO would be more decentralized, using `Ownable` for parameter setting provides a basic access control pattern, acknowledging that initial configurations might require privileged control before transitioning to community governance.

**Considerations and Potential Improvements (Not implemented to keep complexity manageable):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating over large arrays (`parentIds`, `childIds`, `activeNodeIds`, `nurturedBy`) or calculating complex reward distributions on-chain can become prohibitively expensive. Real-world implementation might need pagination, off-chain processing with on-chain verification, or different data structures.
*   **Robust Reward Distribution:** The claim functions (`claimPruningReward`, `claimPruningStakeSlash`, `claimSynthesisReward`) are placeholders. Implementing proportional distribution based on stakes and vote weights requires more complex state tracking (e.g., storing claimable amounts per user per event).
*   **Pruning Quorum/Voting Period:** The current `executePruning` lacks an explicit time lock or minimum participation quorum. A real system would require these.
*   **Link Deletion:** The contract doesn't explicitly support deleting links, only pruning nodes which implicitly invalidates links.
*   **Content Moderation:** Relying solely on pruning might be slow. Off-chain moderation with slashing mechanisms could be integrated.
*   **Dynamic Node Content:** Currently, `contentHash` is immutable after creation. Allowing limited updates with staking/governance could be an addition.
*   **Full DAO Governance:** Replacing `Ownable` with a robust DAO structure for parameter changes, upgrades, and treasury management is a natural next step for full decentralization.
*   **NFT Representation:** Nodes or links could potentially be represented as dynamic NFTs, changing appearance based on state or stake.

This contract provides a foundation for a unique decentralized application, combining elements of social interaction, data structuring, and economic incentives on the blockchain.
