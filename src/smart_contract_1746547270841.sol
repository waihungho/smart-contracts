Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept called "Quantum Vault". It incorporates several advanced, creative, and trendy features like dynamic state, conditional withdrawals based on multiple factors (time, state, delegate), support for multiple asset types, simulated "entropy" collection influencing features, batch operations, and more.

It's designed to be *conceptually* advanced and feature-rich rather than a simple, standard vault. The "Quantum" aspect is simulated through a dynamic state variable that influences contract behavior.

**Solidity Smart Contract: Quantum Vault**

**License:** MIT

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Defines the core data storage including ownership, user balances for various asset types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155), quantum state, locks, fees, entropy, delegation maps, etc.
2.  **Enums:** Defines possible states for the vault's "quantum state".
3.  **Events:** Defines events emitted on significant actions like deposits, withdrawals, state changes, lock updates, etc.
4.  **Modifiers:** Defines reusable access control and state check conditions.
5.  **Interfaces:** Imports necessary ERC standard interfaces.
6.  **Constructor:** Initializes the contract owner.
7.  **Receive/Fallback:** Handles incoming raw ETH.
8.  **Deposit Functions:** Allows users to deposit various asset types into the vault.
9.  **ERC721/ERC1155 Receiver Hooks:** Implements standard hooks required for receiving NFTs.
10. **Withdrawal Functions (Basic):** Allows users to withdraw their assets under standard conditions.
11. **Conditional/Advanced Withdrawal Functions:** Implements withdrawals with specific conditions (time lock, state lock, delayed execution, delegated).
12. **Batch Operation Functions:** Allows depositing or withdrawing multiple tokens/NFTs in a single transaction.
13. **Vault State Management:** Functions for the owner to change the quantum state or simulate external conditions affecting it.
14. **Lock Management:** Functions to set, extend, or query user-specific time locks.
15. **Delegation Management:** Functions for users to set or revoke withdrawal delegates.
16. **Entropy System:** Functions to check collected entropy and claim potential benefits (simulated).
17. **Fee Management:** Functions to set fee rates and query collected fees (owner/admin).
18. **Query Functions:** Allows users and others to check balances, state, locks, and other vault data.
19. **Admin/Owner Functions:** Utility functions for the contract owner (e.g., pausing, setting parameters).

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Sets the initial contract owner.
2.  `receive()`: Handles receiving direct ETH transfers (redirects to deposit).

13. `checkWithdrawalConditions(address user)`: Internal helper to check various conditions for withdrawal (state, time lock, pause).
14. `calculateDynamicFee(uint256 amount)`: Internal helper to calculate fees based on state and amount.
15. `setTimeLock(uint256 unlockTime)`: Sets a time lock for the user's withdrawals.
16. `extendTimeLock(uint256 extraTime)`: Extends the existing time lock for the user.
17. `initiateDelayedWithdrawal(address token, uint256 amount, uint256 delaySeconds)`: Schedules a future withdrawal for ERC20 (example).
18. `executeDelayedWithdrawal(address token)`: Executes a previously initiated delayed withdrawal if time is up.
19. `setWithdrawalDelegate(address delegatee)`: Allows a user to designate an address that can withdraw on their behalf.
20. `revokeWithdrawalDelegate()`: Allows a user to remove their designated delegate.
21. `withdrawDelegatedERC20(address owner, address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows a designated delegate to withdraw ERC20 on behalf of the owner.

32. `getCollectedEntropy(address user)`: Returns the simulated entropy collected by a user.
