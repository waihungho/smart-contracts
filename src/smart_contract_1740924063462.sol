/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous News Aggregator (DANA)
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized news aggregator, allowing users to submit news articles, 
 *         stake tokens on the accuracy of those articles, and earn rewards based on the collective assessment 
 *         of trustworthiness. It incorporates dynamic staking tiers, reputation-based moderation, and 
 *         a built-in dispute resolution mechanism.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  Article Submission:  Users submit article URLs along with a brief summary.
 *  2.  Staking & Reputation: Users stake tokens (e.g., a custom ERC20 token) on the truthfulness of an article.  Staking power is weighted by user reputation.
 *  3.  Dynamic Staking Tiers: Automatically adjusts staking requirements based on overall network activity and volatility.
 *  4.  Moderation:  High-reputation users (Moderators) can flag articles as potentially misleading.
 *  5.  Dispute Resolution:  If an article is flagged, a dispute resolution round begins, using a Quadratic Voting mechanism.
 *  6.  Reward Distribution:  Accurate stakers are rewarded with a portion of staked tokens from inaccurate stakers and platform fees. Moderators earn additional fees.
 *  7.  Reputation System:  User reputation increases with accurate stakes/moderation and decreases with inaccurate ones.
 *  8.  Emergency Shutdown: Contract owner can pause certain functionalities in case of emergency.
 *
 *  Function Summary:
 *  -   `submitArticle(string memory _url, string memory _summary)`: Allows users to submit a news article URL and summary.
 *  -   `stakeArticle(uint256 _articleId, bool _isAccurate, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake tokens on the accuracy of a specific article.
 *  -   `flagArticle(uint256 _articleId)`: Allows moderators to flag an article for review.
 *  -   `startDispute(uint256 _articleId)`: Starts the dispute resolution process for a flagged article.
 *  -   `voteInDispute(uint256 _articleId, bool _isAccurate, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows users to vote in a dispute using Quadratic Voting (amount staked effectively square rooted).
 *  -   `resolveDispute(uint256 _articleId)`: Resolves the dispute based on the outcome of the voting and distributes rewards/penalties.
 *  -   `updateStakingTier(uint256 _newTier)`: Allows the owner to manually update staking tiers if the automated system malfunctions.
 *  -   `pause(bool _shouldPause)`: Pauses/unpauses critical functions like article submission and staking.
 *  -   `withdrawTokens(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens held by the contract.

    //  Future Considerations:
    //  -   Automated Staking Tier Adjustment:  Implement logic to automatically adjust the `currentStakingTier` based on network activity (e.g., number of articles submitted, volatility in dispute outcomes).
    //  -   Quadratic Funding for Accurate Reporting:  Consider using quadratic funding principles to incentivize accurate article submissions, where the rewards are amplified based on the number of independent stakers who agree on the accuracy of the article.
    //  -   Data Availability Layer Integration:  Integrate with a data availability solution (e.g., IPFS) to ensure the long-term availability of article content, even if the original URL becomes unavailable.
    //  -   Customizable Dispute Resolution Mechanisms:  Allow the community to vote on different dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., Kleros integration) for specific types of articles or topics.
    //  -   AI-Assisted Moderation: Integrate AI tools for automatic detection of misinformation, potentially reducing the workload on human moderators.
    //  -   Reputation Decay: Implement a mechanism for reputation to decay over time, requiring users to actively participate to maintain their reputation.
}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a clear overview of the contract's purpose, architecture, and function details.
* **Dynamic Staking Tiers:**  The contract includes a `currentStakingTier` variable that can be adjusted to influence the cost of staking.  While manual in this version, the comments suggest automation. This is an important feature for scaling and adapting to changing network conditions.
* **Reputation-Based Moderation:**  Users gain reputation for accurate stakes and lose reputation for inaccurate ones. High-reputation users can become moderators, adding a layer of quality control.
* **Quadratic Voting in Disputes:**  Implemented a quadratic voting mechanism in the dispute resolution process. The *effective* voting power is the square root of the amount staked, making it more difficult for whales to dominate voting.  A crucial concept for fair decentralized governance.
* **Platform Fees:** A percentage of staking rewards is allocated to the platform, providing a sustainable funding model.
* **Emergency Shutdown:** Includes `pause` functionality for emergency situations.
* **Withdrawal Function:** Allows the owner to withdraw stuck tokens (a common vulnerability in smart contracts).
* **`distributeRewards` Function:** Now uses a proportion of `winningStake` over total to calculate `reward` for stakers.
* **Reputation Decay:** Added the concept of reputation decay in the future considerations.
* **Data Availability Layer Integration:** Suggesting integration with IPFS.
* **Clearer Error Messages:**  Improved error messages for better user feedback.
* **Comprehensive Events:**  Emits events for all key actions, making it easier to track the contract's activity.
* **OpenZeppelin Imports:** Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC20 token interaction, ownership, and safe math operations. This promotes security and code reusability.
* **Thorough Comments:** Provides detailed comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each variable, function, and code block.
* **Consideration for Edge Cases:**Includes protection against division by zero in the `distributeReward` function. The `decreaseReputation` method now prevents underflow.
* **Security Considerations:** Uses SafeMath to prevent integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.  Includes transferFrom to prevent exploits.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:** The code itself isn't heavily optimized for gas, as the primary goal was to demonstrate functionality and concepts. However, gas optimization would be the next step.  For example, caching values, minimizing storage writes, and optimizing loops.
* **Future Considerations Section:** This is very important! It provides a roadmap for future development and improvements, highlighting areas where the contract can be made even more robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

This improved version provides a more complete and sophisticated foundation for a decentralized news aggregator, incorporating modern blockchain development best practices.  Remember that this is a starting point and would require thorough testing and auditing before being deployed to a production environment.  Also, carefully consider the legal implications of running a platform like this.
