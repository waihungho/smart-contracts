 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A Smart Contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective.
 *      This contract allows artists to propose, collaborate on, and exhibit digital artworks.
 *      It incorporates advanced concepts like collaborative artwork creation, decentralized curation,
 *      dynamic NFT metadata, and on-chain governance for collective decisions.
 *      This is a creative and trendy concept leveraging NFTs and DAOs for art in the Web3 space.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 * 1. requestMembership(): Allows artists to request membership in the collective.
 * 2. approveMembership(address _artist): Admin function to approve pending membership requests.
 * 3. revokeMembership(address _artist): Admin function to revoke membership.
 * 4. proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata): Allows members to propose changes to governance parameters.
 * 5. voteOnGovernanceChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support): Allows members to vote on governance change proposals.
 * 6. executeGovernanceChange(uint256 _proposalId): Admin function to execute approved governance changes.
 *
 * **Artwork Management & Collaboration:**
 * 7. proposeArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _initialConcept): Allows members to propose new artwork concepts.
 * 8. contributeToArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _contribution): Allows members to contribute to an artwork in the collaborative phase.
 * 9. finalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _finalArtworkData): Allows the artwork proposer to finalize the artwork after collaboration.
 * 10. curateArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows members to vote to curate (approve for exhibition) a finalized artwork.
 * 11. mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId): Mints an NFT for a curated artwork, payable to the collective treasury.
 * 12. burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId): Allows the collective to burn an NFT (e.g., for ethical reasons, with governance).
 * 13. setArtworkMetadataBaseURI(string memory _baseURI): Admin function to set the base URI for artwork NFT metadata.
 * 14. updateArtworkDynamicMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _dynamicData): Allows for updating dynamic metadata of an artwork NFT.
 *
 * **Exhibition & Display:**
 * 15. proposeExhibition(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256[] memory _artworkIds): Allows members to propose an exhibition of curated artworks.
 * 16. voteOnExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _support): Allows members to vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 17. startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Admin function to start an approved exhibition.
 * 18. endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Admin function to end an ongoing exhibition.
 * 19. setExhibitionTheme(uint256 _exhibitionId, string memory _theme): Allows setting a theme for an exhibition.
 * 20. donateToCollective(): Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective treasury.
 * 21. withdrawFromTreasury(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount): Admin function to withdraw funds from the treasury (governance approval ideally).
 * 22. getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): Public view function to retrieve details about an artwork.
 * 23. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): Public view function to retrieve details about an exhibition.
