This Solidity smart contract, named "SynergiaProtocol," introduces a novel framework for decentralized collective intelligence focused on the discovery, evaluation, and funding of emerging concepts or projects. It combines several advanced and trendy blockchain concepts: **Dynamic NFTs**, an **Oracle-Validated Prediction Market**, a **Reputation System (Synergia Points)**, and **Community Governance** to create a self-evolving ecosystem for conceptual asset discovery.

**Core Idea:** Imagine a decentralized R&D or venture fund. Users propose "concepts" as unique NFTs. The community then "predicts" the future impact or validity of these concepts by staking tokens. External oracles provide objective validation, which resolves prediction rounds and awards "Synergia Points" to successful concepts and accurate predictors. Concepts accumulating high Synergia Points become eligible for funding from a community-managed treasury.

### **SynergiaProtocol: Outline & Function Summary**

**I. Core Infrastructure & Access Control**
1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract, setting up initial admin, prediction token, protocol fee, and treasury.
2.  `setGovernance`: Allows the current governance entity to transfer the `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` to a new address (e.g., a DAO contract).
3.  `updateProtocolFee`: Modifies the fee required to propose a new concept (callable by Governance).
4.  `pauseProtocol`: Emergency function to pause most state-changing operations (callable by Admin).
5.  `unpauseProtocol`: Resumes operations after a pause (callable by Admin).
6.  `addOracle`: Grants the `ORACLE_ROLE` to a new address, allowing them to submit concept validations (callable by Governance).
7.  `removeOracle`: Revokes the `ORACLE_ROLE` from an address (callable by Governance).

**II. Concept Token (ERC721) Management**
8.  `proposeConcept`: Mints a new "Concept NFT" for a fee, representing a new idea or project, with an associated metadata URI.
9.  `updateConceptMetadata`: Allows the Concept NFT owner to update the metadata URI, pointing to updated concept details.
10. `getConceptDetails`: Retrieves all structured on-chain data for a given Concept NFT.
11. `burnConcept`: Allows a Concept NFT owner to burn their token, effectively marking the concept as inactive/failed.

**III. Prediction Market & Synergia Points**
12. `submitPrediction`: Users stake `predictionToken` to predict a score (0-100) for a concept's future impact within a specific prediction round.
13. `submitOracleValidation`: Oracles submit a validated score for a concept at the end of a prediction round, resolving it and triggering Synergia Point calculation for the concept.
14. `redeemPredictionRewards`: Allows predictors to claim their staked tokens and potential rewards based on the accuracy of their prediction compared to the oracle's validation.
15. `getPredictionRoundDetails`: Retrieves the current status and validated outcome for a specific prediction round.
16. `getPredictionDetails`: Retrieves an individual user's prediction details for a given round.

**IV. Synergia Point & Reputation System**
17. `getConceptSynergiaPoints`: Returns the total accumulated "Synergia Points" for a specific concept, reflecting its validated potential.
18. `getUserPredictionAccuracy`: Calculates and returns a user's overall accuracy percentage across all predictions they've made.
19. `allocateTreasuryFunding`: A governance function to distribute `predictionToken` from the protocol treasury to the owner of a concept, typically for concepts with high Synergia Points.

**V. Treasury & Fee Management**
20. `withdrawProtocolFees`: Allows the Admin to withdraw accumulated protocol fees (from concept proposals) to the designated `protocolTreasury` address.
21. `depositToTreasury`: Allows any user to donate `predictionToken` to the protocol treasury, bolstering its funding capacity.

/**
 * @title SynergiaProtocol - Decentralized Predictive Asset & Knowledge Network
 * @dev This contract implements a novel protocol for collective intelligence to identify,
 *      evaluate, and fund emerging concepts or projects. It combines dynamic NFTs,
 *      a prediction market, an oracle-driven validation system, and community governance.
 *      Concepts are represented as ERC721 tokens whose "Synergia Points" (reputation)
 *      evolve based on community predictions and external oracle validations.
 *      Accurate predictors and high-scoring concepts can earn rewards and treasury funding.
 *
 * @notice **Creative & Advanced Concepts:**
 *         - **Dynamic NFTs (Concept Tokens):** ERC721 tokens whose value/reputation (Synergia Points)
 *           is dynamically updated based on protocol activity (predictions, oracle validation). The `synergiaPoints`
 *           field within the `Concept` struct represents this dynamic aspect.
 *         - **Oracle-Driven Validation:** Integration with external oracles (e.g., Chainlink, custom)
 *           to provide objective evaluation of concepts, crucial for prediction market resolution.
 *         - **Decentralized Predictive Market:** Users stake tokens on the perceived future impact
 *           or validity of concepts, fostering collective intelligence.
 *         - **Reputation-based Funding:** Concepts with high "Synergia Points" (indicating validated
 *           potential) become eligible for funding from a community-managed treasury.
 *         - **Gamified Engagement:** Synergia Points, predictor accuracy scores, and reward mechanisms
 *           incentivize active and insightful participation.
 *         - **Hybrid Data Model:** Combining on-chain immutable concept metadata with off-chain
 *           (e.g., IPFS) detailed descriptions, validated by on-chain oracles.
 *
 * @dev **Non-Duplication Claim:** While individual components like ERC721, prediction markets,
 *      and DAOs exist, this protocol's specific combination of dynamic concept NFTs tied to
 *      oracle-validated predictive markets, which in turn drive a reputation (Synergia Points)
 *      system for treasury allocation to "ideas," is designed to be a unique synthesis.
 *      It's not merely a prediction market for events, nor just a dynamic NFT collection,
 *      but an evolving ecosystem for conceptual asset discovery and funding.
