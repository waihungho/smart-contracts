/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to mint, curate, and govern a shared art collection.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * **1. NFT Management:**
 *    - mintArtwork: Artists mint their artwork as NFTs.
 *    - transferArtwork: Transfer ownership of artwork NFTs.
 *    - burnArtwork: Allow artist/collective to burn artwork NFTs (with conditions).
 *    - getArtworkDetails: View metadata and details of an artwork NFT.
 *    - setBaseURI: Admin function to set the base URI for NFT metadata.
 *
 * **2. Collective Membership & Governance:**
 *    - joinCollective: Artists request to join the collective.
 *    - leaveCollective: Artists can leave the collective.
 *    - voteForMembership: Collective members vote on membership requests.
 *    - proposeRuleChange: Members propose changes to collective rules (e.g., fees, voting periods).
 *    - voteOnRuleChange: Members vote on proposed rule changes.
 *    - setVotingQuorum: Admin function to set the voting quorum for proposals.
 *    - getCollectiveMembers: View list of current collective members.
 *
 * **3. Curatorial Features:**
 *    - submitArtworkForCuratedCollection: Artists submit their minted artwork to a curated collection.
 *    - voteOnArtworkForCuration: Collective members vote on submitted artwork for curation.
 *    - featureArtworkInCollection: Add artwork to the curated collection if approved by vote.
 *    - removeFromCuratedCollection: Remove artwork from the curated collection (governance vote).
 *    - getCuratedCollection: View list of artwork IDs in the curated collection.
 *
 * **4. Treasury & Revenue Management:**
 *    - depositToTreasury: Allow anyone to deposit funds to the collective treasury.
 *    - withdrawFromTreasury: Collective members can propose and vote to withdraw funds from the treasury.
 *    - setMintingFee: Admin function to set the minting fee for artwork.
 *    - distributeRevenue: Distribute revenue from NFT sales or treasury to collective members (governance vote).
 *    - getTreasuryBalance: View the current balance of the collective treasury.
 *
 * **5. Generative Art Element (Simple Example):**
 *    - generateArtworkHash: (Simplified example) Generate a pseudo-random hash based on artist and timestamp for unique artwork IDs.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * **NFT Management:**
 *   - `mintArtwork(string _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to mint their artwork NFT.
 *   - `transferArtwork(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`: Transfers ownership of an artwork NFT.

 *   - `voteOnRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on a rule change proposal.
 *   - `setVotingQuorum(uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Admin function to set the voting quorum for proposals.
 *   - `getCollectiveMembers()`: Retrieves a list of addresses of collective members.
 *
 * **Curatorial Features:**
 *   - `submitArtworkForCuratedCollection(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows artists to submit their minted artwork for curation consideration.
 *   - `voteOnArtworkForCuration(uint256 _tokenId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on artwork for inclusion in the curated collection.
 *   - `featureArtworkInCollection(uint256 _tokenId)`: Adds artwork to the curated collection if approved by vote.
 *   - `removeFromCuratedCollection(uint256 _tokenId)`: Starts a proposal to remove artwork from the curated collection.
 *   - `getCuratedCollection()`: Retrieves a list of artwork IDs in the curated collection.
 *
 * **Treasury & Revenue Management:**
 *   - `depositToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective treasury.
 *   - `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Starts a proposal to withdraw ETH from the treasury.
 *   - `setMintingFee(uint256 _fee)`: Admin function to set the minting fee.
 *   - `distributeRevenue(uint256 _amount)`: Starts a proposal to distribute revenue to collective members.
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Retrieves the current balance of the collective treasury.
 *
 * **Generative Art Element:**
 *   - `generateArtworkHash(address _artist)`: (Simplified example) Generates a unique artwork ID hash.
