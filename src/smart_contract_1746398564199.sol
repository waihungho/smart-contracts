Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Innovation Fund (DAIF). This contract incorporates concepts like:

*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for managing different user permissions (Admin, Member, EmergencyCouncil, Oracle).
*   **Semi-Fungible Membership Tokens (SFTs):** Utilizing ERC-1155 tokens to represent different tiers of membership or stake, with configurable voting weights per token type.
*   **Reputation System:** A simple on-chain reputation score for members that can influence voting weight (or be used for other logic).
*   **Structured Proposal Management:** A standard DAO pattern with proposal states (Draft, Active, Queued, Executed, Failed, Rejected, Cancelled) and weighted voting.
*   **Configurable Voting Parameters:** Quorum and threshold numerators adjustable by admin.
*   **Funding Request Workflow:** A specific type of proposal for requesting funds from the treasury, including milestone tracking (though milestone verification itself would likely rely on Oracles or further proposals).
*   **Treasury Management:** Deposit of ERC20 tokens, and withdrawal primarily controlled by proposal execution, with an emergency withdrawal for a specific role.
*   **Pausing Mechanism:** Emergency control to pause critical functions.
*   **External Call Execution:** Proposals can bundle multiple external calls to be executed upon success.

This contract tries to combine these elements in a non-trivial way, focusing on membership mechanics, weighted voting, and a structured funding process as its core innovation beyond a basic DAO.

 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Innovation Fund (DAIF)
 * @notice A smart contract for a DAO managing an innovation fund, featuring weighted voting,
 *         membership SFTs, reputation, and structured funding proposals.
 *
 * @dev This contract implements a DAO governance model where members vote on proposals
 *      to allocate treasury funds to innovative projects. Membership and voting power
 *      are influenced by ERC-1155 Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs) and an on-chain reputation score.
 *      Proposals can contain multiple calls for execution upon success.
 *      The contract uses OpenZeppelin libraries for access control, tokens, safety, and pausing.
