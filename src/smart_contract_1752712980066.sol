This smart contract, "Quantum Nexus DAO," presents an advanced, creative, and trendy decentralized autonomous organization. It goes beyond typical token-weighted voting by incorporating a sophisticated **reputation system**, **dynamic governance parameters**, and **AI Oracle integration** to foster a highly adaptive and intelligent decision-making process. The goal is to create a DAO that can evolve its own rules based on internal state and external AI-driven insights, ensuring long-term resilience and responsiveness.

---

### Outline: Quantum Nexus DAO - An Adaptive, AI-Augmented Decentralized Governance Platform

**I. Core DAO Initialization & Setup:**
*   `constructor`: Initializes the DAO with its foundational token, initial guardian, and core governance parameters.

**II. Proposal & Voting Mechanics:**
*   `createProposal`: Allows members to submit new governance proposals, detailing their intended actions (e.g., treasury spend, parameter changes, new adaptive rules).
*   `voteOnProposal`: Enables members to cast votes (for, against, abstain). Voting power is a combination of their token balance and reputation score, potentially delegated.
*   `queueProposalForExecution`: Moves a successfully passed proposal into a timelock queue, ensuring a delay before execution.
*   `executeQueuedProposal`: Executes a proposal after its timelock has elapsed, triggering its intended on-chain action.
*   `cancelQueuedProposal`: Provides a mechanism for the proposal creator or DAO governance to cancel a proposal before its execution.

**III. AI Oracle Integration & Dynamic Adaptation:**
*   `setAIOracleAddress`: Allows the DAO to designate or update the trusted address of its off-chain AI Oracle.
*   `submitAIRecommendation`: (Callable by AI Oracle only) The AI Oracle provides a sentiment or recommendation score for a specific proposal, which can influence its approval thresholds.
*   `proposeAdaptiveRule`: Members can propose new, self-executing adaptive rules. These rules define conditions and actions to automatically adjust governance parameters (e.g., quorum, voting period) based on on-chain metrics or AI insights.
*   `enactAdaptiveRule`: (Internal/called by `executeQueuedProposal`) Activates a new adaptive rule once it has been successfully proposed and voted on by the DAO.
*   `adjustDynamicThresholds`: A function callable by a keeper network or the AI Oracle to periodically re-evaluate and apply active adaptive rules, updating current governance thresholds like quorum and approval percentages.
*   `retrieveProposalAIRecommendation`: Public view function to query the AI oracle's last recommendation for a specific proposal.

**IV. Member & Reputation Management:**
*   `registerMember`: Onboards a new member into the DAO, potentially assigning an initial reputation score.
*   `updateMemberProfile`: Allows members to update non-sensitive public profile information associated with their address.
*   `mintReputation`: Allows DAO governance to grant reputation points to members, typically as a reward for contributions or positive engagement.
*   `burnReputation`: Allows DAO governance to revoke reputation points, for instance, in response to malicious or detrimental behavior.
*   `delegateVotingPower`: Members can delegate their combined token and reputation-based voting power to another trusted member.
*   `revokeDelegation`: Revokes any active delegation of voting power, returning control to the original member.
*   `getEffectiveVotingPower`: View function to calculate an address's current total effective voting power, considering tokens, reputation, and delegations.

**V. Treasury Management:**
*   `depositTreasuryAssets`: Enables anyone to deposit various asset types (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, ETH) into the DAO's collective treasury.
*   `withdrawTreasuryAssets`: (Internal) A helper function to facilitate asset withdrawals, exclusively triggered by a successfully executed governance proposal.
*   `proposeTreasurySpend`: A specific proposal type for requesting and authorizing the spending of funds from the DAO treasury.

**VI. DAO Evolution & Maintenance:**
*   `setGovernanceParameter`: A general-purpose function for the DAO to update static governance parameters (e.g., default voting period, minimum proposer power).
*   `proposeContractUpgrade`: Initiates a proposal specifically for upgrading the underlying contract logic, assuming an upgradeable proxy pattern (e.g., UUPS).
*   `emergencyHaltSystem`: An emergency function, likely multi-sig controlled, to temporarily pause critical contract operations in case of a severe vulnerability or attack.
*   `releaseSystemHalt`: Reverses the emergency halt, restoring normal operations after the emergency has been resolved.
*   `signalDAOEvolution`: A non-binding proposal type that allows members to signal broad interest in future strategic directions or major structural changes, providing input for off-chain analysis or AI insights without requiring a formal vote.

// Outline: Quantum Nexus DAO - An Adaptive, AI-Augmented Decentralized Governance Platform
// This contract implements a sophisticated DAO that blends traditional token-based voting with a reputation system,
// dynamic governance parameters, and integration with an off-chain AI oracle for decision support.
// It aims to create a highly adaptive and intelligent governance structure.

// Function Summary:
// I. Core DAO Initialization & Setup:
// 1.  constructor: Initializes the DAO with initial guardian, token, and core parameters.

// II. Proposal & Voting Mechanics:
// 2.  createProposal: Allows members to submit new governance proposals (e.g., treasury spend, parameter change, rule change).
// 3.  voteOnProposal: Members cast their vote (for/against/abstain). Voting power is a combination of token balance and reputation score.
// 4.  queueProposalForExecution: Moves a passed proposal into a timelock queue before execution.
// 5.  executeQueuedProposal: Executes a proposal after its timelock period has elapsed.
// 6.  cancelQueuedProposal: Allows the proposal creator or DAO governance to cancel a queued proposal.

// III. AI Oracle Integration & Dynamic Adaptation:
// 7.  setAIOracleAddress: Allows DAO governance to set or update the address of the trusted AI Oracle.

// 9.  proposeAdaptiveRule: Members can propose new adaptive rules that automatically adjust governance parameters (e.g., quorum, voting period) based on predefined triggers or AI insights.
// 10. enactAdaptiveRule: (Internal/called by executeQueuedProposal) Activates a new adaptive rule after it has been proposed and passed.
// 11. adjustDynamicThresholds: A function that re-evaluates and applies active adaptive rules to update current governance thresholds. Can be called by a keeper or AI Oracle.
// 12. retrieveProposalAIRecommendation: Public view function to get the AI oracle's last recommendation for a specific proposal.

// IV. Member & Reputation Management:
// 13. registerMember: Onboards a new member. Could involve initial token stake or guardian approval.
// 14. updateMemberProfile: Allows members to update non-sensitive public profile information associated with their address.
// 15. mintReputation: Allows DAO governance to assign reputation points to a member (e.g., for contributions, bug bounties).
// 16. burnReputation: Allows DAO governance to revoke reputation points (e.g., for malicious acts).
// 17. delegateVotingPower: Members can delegate their token-based and/or reputation-based voting power to another address.
// 18. revokeDelegation: Revokes any active delegation of voting power.
