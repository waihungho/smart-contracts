/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation & Conditional Access Contract
 * @author Bard (Example Contract - No Open Source Duplication)
 * @dev This contract demonstrates advanced concepts by implementing a dynamic reputation system
 *      that governs access to various features and functionalities within the contract.
 *      It's designed to be a creative example and avoids direct duplication of common open-source contracts.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Reputation Management:**
 *    - `updateReputation(address user, int256 reputationChange, string reason)`: Allows authorized entities to update a user's reputation score.
 *    - `getReputation(address user)`: Retrieves the current reputation score of a user.
 *    - `setReputationThreshold(uint256 threshold, Feature feature)`: Sets a reputation threshold required to access a specific feature.
 *    - `getReputationThreshold(Feature feature)`: Retrieves the reputation threshold for a given feature.
 *    - `isReputationSufficient(address user, Feature feature)`: Checks if a user's reputation is sufficient to access a feature.
 *    - `addReputationAuthority(address authority)`: Adds an address authorized to update reputation scores.
 *    - `removeReputationAuthority(address authority)`: Removes a reputation authority.
 *    - `isReputationAuthority(address authority)`: Checks if an address is a reputation authority.
 *
 * **2. Conditional Access Features (Illustrative Examples):**
 *    - `enableFeature(Feature feature)`: Enables a specific feature, potentially for testing or phased rollouts.
 *    - `disableFeature(Feature feature)`: Disables a feature.
 *    - `isFeatureEnabled(Feature feature)`: Checks if a feature is currently enabled.
 *    - `accessConditionalFeature(Feature feature)`:  An example function demonstrating access control based on reputation and feature enablement.
 *
 * **3. Data Management & Configuration:**
 *    - `setContractName(string newName)`: Sets a descriptive name for the contract.
 *    - `getContractName()`: Retrieves the contract name.
 *
 * **4. Ownership and Control:**
 *    - `setOwner(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
 *    - `owner()`: Returns the contract owner's address.
 *    - `renounceOwnership()`: Allows the owner to renounce ownership, making the contract potentially immutable.
 *
 * **5. Pause & Emergency Controls:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Pauses most contract functions in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Resumes contract functionality.
 *    - `isContractPaused()`: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
 *    - `emergencyShutdown()`: A more drastic shutdown mechanism, potentially disabling critical functionalities irreversibly.
 *
 * **6. Utility & Recovery:**
 *    - `recoverStuckEther()`: Allows the owner to recover accidentally sent Ether to the contract.
 *    - `recoverStuckTokens(address tokenAddress, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to recover accidentally sent ERC-20 tokens.
