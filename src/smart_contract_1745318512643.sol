 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It allows for collaborative art creation, ownership, governance, and exhibition within a decentralized framework.
 * This contract incorporates advanced concepts like:
 *   - Dynamic NFT Metadata: NFTs with metadata that can evolve based on community votes.
 *   - Decentralized Governance:  Using proposals and voting for key decisions.
 *   - Collaborative Art Creation:  Features for contributing to and evolving artworks.
 *   - On-Chain Curation: Community-driven curation of exhibited art.
 *   - Tokenized Rewards:  Incentivizing participation through a reward token.
 *   - Dynamic Royalties: Royalties that can be adjusted by the DAO.
 *   - Generative Art Integration (Conceptual): Framework for integrating generative art aspects.
 *   - Layered Ownership:  Allowing for shared ownership of artworks.
 *   - Staking for Governance Power:  Staking tokens to gain voting weight.
 *   - Decentralized Exhibition Space:  Managing virtual exhibition spaces.
 *
 * **Function Outline and Summary:**
 *
 * **Core NFT Functions:**
 * 1. `mintArtNFT(string memory _initialMetadata)`: Mints a new Art NFT with initial metadata. (Only Governor Role)
 * 2. `transferArtNFT(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`: Transfers ownership of an Art NFT. (Standard ERC721 transfer)
 * 3. `burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Burns (destroys) an Art NFT. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 * 4. `getArtNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the current metadata URI for an Art NFT.
 * 5. `setArtNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _newMetadata)`: Updates the metadata URI of an Art NFT. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 *
 * **Governance and Proposal Functions:**
 * 6. `submitProposal(ProposalType _proposalType, bytes memory _proposalData, string memory _description)`: Submits a new governance proposal.
 * 7. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal.
 * 8. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes. (Only Governor Role, after voting period)
 * 9. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gets the current state of a proposal.
 * 10. `getProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gets the vote counts for a proposal.
 * 11. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Sets the voting period for proposals. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 * 12. `setQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Sets the quorum required for proposal approval. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 *
 * **Collective and Collaboration Functions:**
 * 13. `contributeToArtwork(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _contributionDetails)`: Allows members to contribute to an artwork (tracked in metadata). (Requires NFT ownership or Governor Role)
 * 14. `getArtworkContributions(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the contribution history for an artwork.
 * 15. `rewardContributor(address _contributor, uint256 _rewardAmount)`: Rewards a contributor with reward tokens. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 * 16. `setDynamicRoyaltyRate(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newRate)`: Sets a dynamic royalty rate for an Art NFT. (Only Governor Role, with proposal)
 * 17. `getDynamicRoyaltyRate(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the dynamic royalty rate for an Art NFT.
 *
 * **Exhibition and Curation Functions (Conceptual):**
 * 18. `submitArtForExhibition(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _exhibitionDetails)`: Allows NFT owners to submit their art for exhibition.
 * 19. `voteForExhibition(uint256 _submissionId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on art submissions for exhibition.
 * 20. `listExhibitedArtworks()`: Lists currently exhibited artworks (based on curation).
 *
 * **Utility and Admin Functions:**
 * 21. `pauseContract()`: Pauses core contract functionalities. (Only Governor Role)
 * 22. `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses core contract functionalities. (Only Governor Role)
 * 23. `setGovernorRole(address _governor, bool _add)`: Adds or removes a Governor role. (Only current Governor Role)
 * 24. `getStakedTokens(address _account)`: Gets the number of staked reward tokens for an account. (For future staking integration)
 * 25. `fallback() external payable`:  Fallback function to reject direct ETH transfers.
 * 26. `receive() external payable`: Receive function to reject direct ETH transfers.

**Example Proposal Submission (from a Governor account):**

// Example: Propose to update metadata of NFT ID 1 to a new URI
// Encode proposal data for METADATA_UPDATE proposal type
bytes memory metadataUpdateData = abi.encode(uint256(1), "ipfs://new-metadata-uri.json");
// Submit the proposal
daacContract.submitProposal(
    DecentralizedArtCollective.ProposalType.METADATA_UPDATE,
    metadataUpdateData,
    "Proposal to update metadata of Art NFT ID 1"
);

// Example: Propose to burn NFT ID 2
// Encode proposal data for BURN_NFT proposal type
bytes memory burnNftData = abi.encode(uint256(2));
// Submit the proposal
daacContract.submitProposal(
    DecentralizedArtCollective.ProposalType.BURN_NFT,
    burnNftData,
    "Proposal to burn Art NFT ID 2"
);

// Example: Propose to change voting period to 10 days
// Encode proposal data for GOVERNANCE_PARAM_CHANGE proposal type
bytes memory governanceChangeData = abi.encode("votingPeriod", uint256(10 days));
// Submit the proposal
daacContract.submitProposal(
    DecentralizedArtCollective.ProposalType.GOVERNANCE_PARAM_CHANGE,
    governanceChangeData,
    "Proposal to change voting period to 10 days"
);

**Example Voting (from any member account):**

// Vote for proposal ID 1 (support = true for yes, false for no)
daacContract.voteOnProposal(1, true);

**Example Proposal Execution (from a Governor account, after voting period):**

// Execute proposal ID 1
daacContract.executeProposal(1);

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The contract is designed to represent a DAAC, enabling community-driven decisions and operations related to art.

2.  **Dynamic NFT Metadata:** The `artNFTMetadataURIs` mapping allows storing and updating metadata URIs for each NFT. The `setArtNFTMetadata` function (governed by proposals) enables the DAO to dynamically change NFT metadata based on community decisions or artwork evolution.  The `contributeToArtwork` function demonstrates a basic way metadata can be updated based on contributions (although in a real DAO, metadata updates would likely be more structured and governed).

3.  **Decentralized Governance (Proposals and Voting):**
    *   **`ProposalType` Enum:** Defines different types of proposals the DAO can vote on (metadata updates, NFT burning, governance parameter changes, etc.).
    *   **`Proposal` Struct:** Stores details of each proposal, including type, data, description, voting period, vote counts, and execution status.
    *   **`submitProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, `executeProposal`, `getProposalState`, `getProposalVotes`:** These functions implement a basic governance system. Members can submit proposals, vote on them, and Governors can execute approved proposals after the voting period.
    *   **`setVotingPeriod`, `setQuorum`:** Governance parameters (voting period and quorum) can also be modified through governance proposals, making the DAO adaptable.

4.  **Collaborative Art Creation (`contributeToArtwork`, `getArtworkContributions`):** The `contributeToArtwork` function allows NFT owners or Governors to add contributions to an artwork. These contributions are stored in `artworkContributions` and can be retrieved using `getArtworkContributions`.  This function demonstrates a basic mechanism for tracking collaborative input into art pieces.

5.  **On-Chain Curation (Conceptual `submitArtForExhibition`, `voteForExhibition`, `listExhibitedArtworks`):** The exhibition functions are conceptual placeholders. In a real DAAC, you could build a more complex system where members submit art for exhibition, the community votes on submissions, and the contract manages a list of curated/exhibited artworks. This example provides a basic framework that can be expanded.

6.  **Tokenized Rewards (`rewardContributor`):** The `rewardContributor` function (currently emitting an event) is a placeholder for integrating a reward token contract. In a real DAAC, you would likely have a separate ERC20 token contract for rewarding contributors, artists, and active community members. The `rewardContributor` function would then interact with this reward token contract to transfer tokens.

7.  **Dynamic Royalties (`setDynamicRoyaltyRate`, `getDynamicRoyaltyRate`):** The `dynamicRoyaltyRates` mapping allows setting different royalty rates for individual NFTs. The `setDynamicRoyaltyRate` function (governed by proposals) enables the DAO to adjust royalty rates for specific artworks, potentially based on their popularity, artist contributions, or other factors.

8.  **Generative Art Integration (Conceptual):** While not directly implementing generative art generation in the contract itself (which is computationally expensive and often done off-chain), the contract provides a framework for integrating with generative art. The `GENERIC` proposal type and the ability to update metadata dynamically could be used to manage and evolve generative art NFTs. For example, a proposal could trigger an off-chain generative art process, and the resulting metadata URI could be updated on the NFT via a metadata update proposal.

9.  **Layered Ownership (Conceptual):**  While not explicitly implemented in this version, the contract's structure could be extended to support layered ownership. For example, you could introduce a mechanism for fractionalizing NFT ownership or having different roles and rights associated with different levels of participation in the DAAC.

10. **Staking for Governance Power (Conceptual `getStakedTokens`):** The `getStakedTokens` function is a placeholder for a staking mechanism. In a more advanced DAAC, you could implement staking of a governance token. Members who stake tokens could receive increased voting power in proposals, incentivizing long-term participation and commitment to the DAO.

11. **Decentralized Exhibition Space (Conceptual `submitArtForExhibition`, `voteForExhibition`, `listExhibitedArtworks`):** The exhibition functions are conceptual and represent a basic idea of managing a virtual exhibition space within the DAO. A more complete implementation would involve:
    *   Storing exhibition details (e.g., virtual gallery URLs, exhibition descriptions).
    *   A more robust voting/curation system to select artworks for exhibition.
    *   Potentially linking the contract to a decentralized storage solution (like IPFS) for exhibition content.

12. **Emergency Stop and Pause Mechanisms (`pauseContract`, `unpauseContract`, `emergencyStop`, `emergencyRestart`):** These functions provide safety mechanisms. `pauseContract` allows temporarily pausing core functionalities for maintenance or in case of issues. `emergencyStop` is a more drastic measure to halt critical operations in case of a serious vulnerability or attack. `emergencyRestart` allows resuming after an emergency stop (all governor-controlled).

13. **Role-Based Access Control (Governors):** The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to implement a `GOVERNOR_ROLE`. Only accounts with this role can perform sensitive actions like minting NFTs, burning NFTs, executing proposals, and managing governance parameters. This ensures that critical operations are controlled by designated DAO governors.

14. **Event Emission:** The contract emits events for significant actions (NFT minting, metadata updates, proposals, voting, executions, governance parameter changes, etc.). Events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and integration with user interfaces and other decentralized applications.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security:** This contract is provided as a conceptual example and should be thoroughly audited for security vulnerabilities before being used in a production environment. DAOs and NFT contracts are prime targets for exploits.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract can be further optimized for gas efficiency in a real-world deployment.
*   **External Dependencies:** Consider carefully the use of external contracts (like reward token contracts, exhibition contracts, decentralized storage). Ensure these dependencies are secure and reliable.
*   **Off-Chain Components:**  For a fully functional DAAC, you would need off-chain components for:
    *   User interfaces for interacting with the contract.
    *   Proposal submission and voting interfaces.
    *   Off-chain generative art processes (if applicable).
    *   Data indexing and retrieval (for easier querying of NFT metadata, contributions, proposals, etc.).
*   **Community and Legal Considerations:** Launching a DAAC involves significant community building, governance design, and legal considerations that are beyond the scope of the smart contract itself.
