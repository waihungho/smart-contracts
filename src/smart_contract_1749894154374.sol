Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines several interesting, advanced, and trending concepts: **Dynamic NFTs** tied to **On-Chain Prediction Markets** with features like **Automated Staking** and **Prediction Pools**.

This goes beyond simple ERC20/ERC721, basic staking, or standard governance.

**Concept:** Users participate in prediction markets on various topics. Their activity (staking amount, prediction accuracy, win rate) influences the state and metadata of a unique **Dynamic NFT** associated with their participation in a specific topic or overall. The contract also includes features for automated staking based on user-defined rules and the creation of prediction pools where users can delegate staking power or share risk/rewards.

### **Contract Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** DynamicPredictiveNFTProtocol

**Core Concepts:**
1.  **Prediction Markets:** Create, participate in, and resolve prediction markets on various topics.
2.  **Dynamic NFTs:** ERC721 tokens whose metadata dynamically updates based on the associated user's activity and performance within prediction markets.
3.  **Automated Staking:** Users can pre-authorize the contract or a trusted keeper to stake on their behalf under certain conditions.
4.  **Prediction Pools:** Users can form pools to aggregate stakes, manage predictions collectively, and share winnings/losses.

**Modules:**
*   **Core Prediction Logic:** Handles topic creation, staking, resolution, and claiming.
*   **NFT Management:** Handles minting, state tracking, and metadata generation logic (or data for off-chain metadata).
*   **User/Stats Tracking:** Records user performance and stake information.
*   **Automated Staking:** Manages pre-authorized staking rules.
*   **Prediction Pools:** Manages pool creation, membership, stakes, and distribution.
*   **Admin/Protocol Settings:** Handles fees, oracles, and other protocol-level configurations.

**Function Summary (Total: 30+ Functions):**

**A. Core Prediction Market Functions:**
1.  `createPredictionTopic`: (Admin/Authorized) Creates a new prediction topic with outcomes, resolution time, etc.
2.  `stake`: (User) Stakes tokens on a specific outcome for an open topic. Updates user and topic stakes.
3.  `unstake`: (User) Unstakes tokens from an *open* topic before resolution. Returns tokens.
4.  `resolvePredictionTopic`: (Oracle/Admin) Resolves a topic with the actual outcome. Calculates winnings and updates topic state.
5.  `claimWinnings`: (User) Claims calculated winnings for a resolved topic. Updates user stats and NFT state.
6.  `cancelPredictionTopic`: (Admin/Authorized) Cancels a topic if conditions aren't met (e.g., resolution time passed without resolution). Refunds stakes.

**B. Dynamic NFT Functions:**
7.  `mintPredictionNFT`: (User) Mints a unique ERC721 NFT for the user, possibly linked to a specific topic or representing their overall participation.
8.  `tokenURI`: (ERC721 Standard) Returns the metadata URI for a given token ID. Calls an internal function to generate a state-dependent identifier.
9.  `_generateNFTMetadataIdentifier`: (Internal) Generates a unique string/ID reflecting the NFT's current state (based on user stats, topic outcome etc.) for off-chain metadata fetching.
10. `updateNFTState`: (Internal/Triggered) Updates the internal state variables that `_generateNFTMetadataIdentifier` relies on (triggered by staking, claiming, resolution, etc.). *This is not a public function for users to call arbitrarily.*
11. `getNFTStateData`: (Public/View) Exposes the raw data used to generate the NFT metadata identifier for a token ID.

**C. User and Stats Functions:**
12. `getUserPredictionStats`: (Public/View) Retrieves comprehensive prediction statistics for a user (accuracy, volume, wins, losses).
13. `getTopicUserStake`: (Public/View) Gets the amount a specific user staked on a specific outcome for a topic.
14. `getUserClaimableAmount`: (Public/View) Checks how much a user can claim for a resolved topic.
15. `getTotalStakedByAddress`: (Public/View) Gets the total amount staked by a user across all topics.

**D. Automated Staking Functions:**
16. `approveAutomatedStaking`: (User) Allows a trusted address (e.g., a keeper) to execute stakes on behalf of the user up to a certain limit or under certain conditions (simplified here).
17. `revokeAutomatedStaking`: (User) Revokes the automated staking approval.
18. `executeAutomatedStake`: (Keeper/Anyone) Executes a pre-approved stake transaction for a user. Requires verification of approval.
19. `getAutomatedStakeApproval`: (Public/View) Checks the current automated staking approval status for a user and keeper.

**E. Prediction Pool Functions:**
20. `createPredictionPool`: (User) Creates a new prediction pool for a specific topic, becoming its manager.
21. `joinPredictionPool`: (User) Contributes tokens to a prediction pool.
22. `leavePredictionPool`: (User) Withdraws their contribution from a pool (subject to pool rules, e.g., not after pool has staked).
23. `poolStake`: (Pool Manager) Stakes funds from the pool on a topic outcome.
24. `poolUnstake`: (Pool Manager) Unstakes funds from the pool (if topic is open).
25. `distributePoolWinnings`: (Pool Manager/Anyone after resolution) Distributes pool winnings pro-rata to members after topic resolution.
26. `getPoolState`: (Public/View) Retrieves the current state and details of a prediction pool.
27. `getUserPoolContribution`: (Public/View) Gets a user's contribution amount to a specific pool.
28. `getPoolMembers`: (Public/View) Lists members of a pool.

**F. Admin and Protocol Functions:**
29. `addOracleAddress`: (Admin) Adds an address authorized to resolve topics.
30. `removeOracleAddress`: (Admin) Removes an authorized oracle address.
31. `setFeePercentage`: (Admin) Sets the protocol fee percentage on winnings.
32. `withdrawFees`: (Admin) Allows the owner to withdraw collected protocol fees.
33. `setPredictionToken`: (Admin) Sets the ERC20 token accepted for staking.
34. `getPredictionTopicCount`: (Public/View) Gets the total number of prediction topics created.
35. `getProtocolFee`: (Public/View) Gets the current protocol fee percentage.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Dynamic NFTs:** The `tokenURI` doesn't return a fixed link. Instead, it calls `_generateNFTMetadataIdentifier` which builds a string based on the on-chain state (user's stats, topic's outcome, etc.). This string is then appended to a base URI. An off-chain service listening for events or querying `getNFTStateData` would use this identifier to dynamically generate the appropriate JSON metadata and potentially image, making the NFT visually or functionally change as the user interacts with the protocol.
2.  **On-Chain Prediction Markets:** Implemented the core logic for creating topics, staking on outcomes, resolving via oracle/admin, and claiming winnings. The payout calculation follows a simple P(win) = (Total Stake on Losing Outcomes) / (Total Stake on Winning Outcome) model, where winners split the losers' pool proportional to their stake.
3.  **Reputation System:** A basic `reputationScore` is tracked in `UserStats`, incremented on correct predictions and decremented (implicitly, by not incrementing) on incorrect ones. This score could be a key factor influencing the Dynamic NFT's state.
4.  **Automated Staking:** Users can `approveAutomatedStaking` for a keeper address. This keeper can then call `executeAutomatedStake` to place stakes on behalf of the user within the approved allowance and time limit. This enables potential future features like staking based on signals, or gasless staking for users (via meta-transactions handled by the keeper). This requires the user to have separately called `predictionToken.approve(address(this), amount)` for the protocol contract.
5.  **Prediction Pools:** Users can `createPredictionPool` for a topic, `joinPredictionPool` to contribute funds, and the `poolManager` can then call `poolStake` using the aggregated funds. After resolution, `distributePoolWinnings` aims to send the pool's share of the payout back to members pro-rata. *Note: The fund flow and management for pools are significantly simplified in this example for demonstration purposes and would require more careful consideration in a production environment to handle edge cases, gas costs of distribution, and manager incentives/security.*
6.  **Oracle/Admin Separation:** While `Ownable` is used, the `onlyOracleOrOwner` modifier allows specific crucial functions (like resolving topics) to be called by designated oracle addresses, decentralizing control over outcomes away from just the owner.
7.  **Modular Design:** Structs and mappings organize data logically for topics, users, automated stakes, and pools. Events are emitted for key actions for off-chain monitoring and indexing.

This contract provides a framework for a sophisticated on-chain prediction platform with unique features tied to user participation and dynamic digital assets.
