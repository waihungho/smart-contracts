/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation & Skill-Based Access Control Contract
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract)
 * @dev This contract implements a dynamic reputation and skill-based access control system.
 * It allows users to earn reputation, acquire skills, and access features based on their reputation and skill levels.
 * The contract incorporates governance features for community-driven parameter adjustments and skill definitions.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * ----------------
 * **User Reputation & Skill Management:**
 * 1. earnReputation(): Allows users to earn reputation points for positive actions (e.g., contributing, participating).
 * 2. reportUser(): Allows users to report other users for negative actions, potentially deducting reputation.
 * 3. getUserReputation(address user): Retrieves the reputation points of a user.
 * 4. learnSkill(Skill skill): Allows users to acquire a specific skill if they meet prerequisites (e.g., reputation level).
 * 5. forgetSkill(Skill skill): Allows users to remove a skill they previously acquired.
 * 6. hasSkill(address user, Skill skill): Checks if a user possesses a specific skill.
 * 7. getUserSkills(address user): Retrieves the list of skills possessed by a user.
 *
 * **Skill & Feature Definition (Admin/Governance):**
 * 8. addSkill(string skillName): Adds a new skill to the system (Admin function).
 * 9. removeSkill(Skill skill): Removes a skill from the system (Admin function).
 * 10. getSkillName(Skill skill): Retrieves the name of a skill.
 * 11. defineFeatureAccess(string featureName, Skill[] memory requiredSkills, uint256 requiredReputation): Defines access requirements for a feature based on skills and reputation (Admin function).
 * 12. updateFeatureAccessReputation(string featureName, uint256 newReputation): Updates the reputation requirement for a feature (Admin function).
 * 13. updateFeatureAccessSkills(string featureName, Skill[] memory newSkills): Updates the skill requirements for a feature (Admin function).
 * 14. getFeatureAccessRequirements(string featureName): Retrieves the access requirements (skills and reputation) for a feature.
 * 15. isFeatureAccessible(address user, string featureName): Checks if a user can access a specific feature based on their skills and reputation.
 *
 * **Governance & Parameter Adjustment:**
 * 16. proposeReputationRuleChange(string ruleDescription, int256 reputationChange): Allows users to propose changes to reputation rules through governance.
 * 17. voteOnRuleChangeProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool vote): Allows users to vote on reputation rule change proposals.
 * 18. executeRuleChangeProposal(uint256 proposalId): Executes an approved reputation rule change proposal (Admin/Governance function after quorum).
 * 19. setReputationGainAmount(uint256 newAmount): Sets the base reputation gain amount for positive actions (Admin function).
 * 20. setReportingReputationPenalty(uint256 newPenalty): Sets the reputation penalty for being reported (Admin function).
 * 21. renounceSkill(Skill skill): Allows users to renounce a skill and potentially receive a portion of the cost back (if applicable, future extension).
 * 22. getSkillList(): Retrieves the list of all available skills.
 * 23. getFeatureList(): Retrieves the list of all defined features.
 * 24. isAdmin(address user): Checks if an address is an admin.
 * 25. addAdmin(address newAdmin): Adds a new admin (Only contract owner).
 * 26. removeAdmin(address adminToRemove): Removes an admin (Only contract owner).
 * 27. getContractVersion(): Returns the contract version.
 * 28. getContractOwner(): Returns the contract owner address.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

The Solidity code above defines a smart contract named `SkillBasedAccessControl`. This contract implements a system for managing user reputation and skills, and uses these to control access to features. Here's a breakdown:

**Core Concepts:**

* **Reputation:** Users earn reputation points for positive actions and lose points for negative ones (like being reported).
* **Skills:**  The contract defines a set of skills (using an `enum` for simplicity, but can be extended to string-based skills for dynamism). Users can learn and forget skills.
* **Feature Access Control:**  Specific features within a decentralized application or system can be gated by reputation and skill requirements. Admins can define which skills and reputation level are needed to access a particular feature.
* **Governance (Basic):**  The contract includes a simple governance mechanism where users can propose changes to reputation rules and vote on these proposals.
* **Admin Roles:**  Certain administrative functions are restricted to designated admin addresses and the contract owner.

**Functions (Categorized as per the summary in the code):**

**User Reputation & Skill Management:**

1.  **`earnReputation()`**:  Increases a user's reputation points.
2.  **`reportUser(address _reportedUser)`**: Decreases the reputation of a reported user.
3.  **`getUserReputation(address _user)`**:  Returns a user's reputation points.
4.  **`learnSkill(Skill _skill)`**:  Allows a user to acquire a skill.
5.  **`forgetSkill(Skill _skill)`**:  Allows a user to remove a skill.
6.  **`hasSkill(address _user, Skill _skill)`**:  Checks if a user has a specific skill.
7.  **`getUserSkills(address _user)`**:  Returns a list of skills a user possesses.
8.  **`renounceSkill(Skill _skill)`**: Allows a user to renounce a skill (currently just forgets it, can be extended).

**Skill & Feature Definition (Admin/Governance):**

9.  **`addSkill(string memory _skillName)`**:  Adds a new skill to the system (admin only).
10. **`removeSkill(Skill _skill)`**: Removes a skill from the system (admin only).
11. **`getSkillName(Skill _skill)`**: Returns the name of a skill given its enum value.
12. **`defineFeatureAccess(string memory _featureName, Skill[] memory _requiredSkills, uint256 _requiredReputation)`**: Defines access requirements for a feature (admin only).
13. **`updateFeatureAccessReputation(string memory _featureName, uint256 _newReputation)`**: Updates the reputation requirement for a feature (admin only).
14. **`updateFeatureAccessSkills(string memory _featureName, Skill[] memory _newSkills)`**: Updates the skill requirements for a feature (admin only).
15. **`getFeatureAccessRequirements(string memory _featureName)`**: Returns the access requirements for a feature.
16. **`isFeatureAccessible(address _user, string memory _featureName)`**: Checks if a user can access a feature.
17. **`getSkillList()`**: Returns a list of all available skill names.
18. **`getFeatureList()`**: Returns a list of all defined feature names.

**Governance & Parameter Adjustment:**

19. **`proposeReputationRuleChange(string memory _ruleDescription, int256 _reputationChange)`**: Allows users to propose reputation rule changes.
20. **`voteOnRuleChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`**: Allows users to vote on rule change proposals.
21. **`executeRuleChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes an approved rule change proposal (admin/governance function).
22. **`setReputationGainAmount(uint256 _newAmount)`**: Sets the base reputation gain amount (admin only).

27. **`getContractVersion()`**: Returns the contract version.
28. **`getContractOwner()`**: Returns the contract owner address.

**Key Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

* **Dynamic Access Control:** Access to features is not static but dynamically determined by user reputation and skills, which can change over time based on user actions and governance.
* **Skill-Based System:** Introduces the concept of skills as prerequisites for accessing functionalities, moving beyond simple token-based access.
* **Basic Governance:**  Includes a rudimentary governance mechanism for community-driven parameter adjustments, making the system more adaptable and decentralized.
* **Reputation System:** Implements a basic reputation system to incentivize positive behavior and potentially discourage negative actions.

**Trendy Aspects:**

* **Web3 Access Control:**  Addresses the trendy need for more granular and dynamic access control mechanisms in decentralized applications.
* **Skill-Based DAOs/Communities:**  Aligns with the growing trend of skill-based decentralized autonomous organizations and online communities where contribution and skills are valued.
* **Reputation in Web3:**  Leverages the concept of reputation as a key element in decentralized identity and trust systems.

**Important Notes:**

* **Enum-Based Skills:**  Using an `enum` for skills is simple but less dynamic. For a truly dynamic skill system, consider using string-based skills and mappings, or external data sources.
* **Governance Simplicity:** The governance mechanism is very basic. Real-world governance would require more robust features like voting periods, quorum requirements, and potentially more complex proposal types.
* **Security Considerations:** This is an example contract and has not been rigorously audited for security vulnerabilities. In a production environment, thorough security audits are crucial.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The contract is written for clarity and conceptual demonstration, not necessarily optimized for gas efficiency.  Gas optimization would be an important consideration for a real-world deployment.
* **Scalability:**  For a large-scale system, consider scalability and data storage implications, especially if the number of users, skills, or features grows significantly. You might need to explore patterns like proxy contracts or off-chain data storage solutions.
