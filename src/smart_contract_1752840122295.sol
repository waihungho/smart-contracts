This Solidity smart contract, named **CarbonFlow**, embodies an innovative decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on climate action. It integrates advanced concepts such as a dynamic, soulbound reputation system (Impact Points), adaptive protocol parameters, milestone-based project funding with slashing, liquid governance delegation, and a simulated mechanism for verifiable real-world impact through NFT integration.

## Smart Contract: CarbonFlow - Decentralized Climate Impact Fund & Governance Network

**Overview:**
CarbonFlow is an innovative decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to accelerate climate action through a unique blend of tokenomics, dynamic reputation, and verifiable impact. It aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where community members propose, fund, and verify climate-positive projects. The core mechanism revolves around 'Impact Points' (IP), a soulbound, non-transferable score reflecting a participant's verifiable contribution and influence within the network. This contract integrates advanced governance, adaptive reward distribution, and a simulated mechanism for on-chain impact verification.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **CFLOW Token (ERC20):** The primary utility and governance token. It's used for funding projects and is distributed as rewards.
*   **Impact Points (IP):** A non-transferable, soulbound reputation score tied directly to a user's influence, voting power, and share in rewards. IP can decay over time to encourage continuous engagement and active participation.
*   **Carbon Offset NFTs (ERC721/ERC1155):** The contract includes a mechanism to register and track external carbon offset NFTs, simulating the integration of verifiable real-world environmental impact.
*   **Adaptive Mechanisms:** While simplified for a single contract, the design allows for dynamic adjustments of protocol parameters (e.g., IP decay rates, reward multipliers) based on collective network activity and validated impact data, hinting at a self-optimizing system.
*   **Milestone-Based Project Funding:** Projects are funded through CFLOW contributions, and funds are released incrementally based on the successful verification of predefined milestones, incorporating a slashing mechanism for non-performance.
*   **Liquid Governance:** Users can delegate their Impact Points (and thus voting power) to other addresses, enabling more flexible and efficient participation in DAO governance.

**Outline of Contract Structure:**

1.  **State Variables:** Core parameters, mappings for users, projects, IP balances, and governance proposals.
2.  **Events:** Comprehensive event logging for transparency and off-chain monitoring of all key actions.
3.  **Modifiers:** Access control modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `onlyGovernor`, `onlyApprovedRegistrar`) to manage permissions.
4.  **Constructor:** Initializes the CFLOW token, sets the initial owner, and preps starting parameters.
5.  **Core CFLOW Token Functions:** (Inherited from ERC20, providing standard token functionalities).
6.  **Impact Point (IP) Management:** Internal functions for minting, burning, and calculating the decaying IP, and external functions for delegation.
7.  **Project Management:** Functions covering the entire lifecycle of a climate project, from proposal and funding to milestone claiming and verification.
8.  **Governance & Voting:** Mechanisms for creating proposals and voting on them using IP-weighted power.
9.  **Treasury & Reward Distribution:** Manages the CFLOW tokens held by the contract and facilitates the distribution of rewards.
10. **Carbon Offset NFT Integration:** Functions to register and 'retire' external carbon offset NFTs on-chain.
11. **Adaptive Mechanism & Oracle Interaction (Simulated):** Functions that mimic external data feeds or internal logic for adjusting protocol parameters.
12. **Emergency/Administrative Functions:** Includes pausing the contract and allowing for governance-controlled treasury withdrawals.

**Function Summary (22 Functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract by deploying the ERC20 CFLOW token, minting an initial supply to the contract owner, and setting up initial DAO parameters.
2.  `proposeProject()`: Allows any user to submit a detailed climate project proposal, specifying funding goals and milestone breakdowns. This automatically creates a corresponding governance proposal.
3.  `fundProject()`: Enables CFLOW holders to contribute CFLOW tokens to an approved project. Contributions increase the funder's Impact Points (IP).
4.  `voteOnProposal()`: Allows Impact Point holders to cast their IP-weighted vote (Yes/No) on any active governance or project approval proposal.
5.  `delegateImpactPoints()`: Enables users to delegate their Impact Points (and thus voting power) to another address, allowing for liquid governance.
6.  `revokeImpactPointDelegation()`: Allows a user to cancel an existing IP delegation, restoring their direct voting power.
7.  `claimProjectMilestone()`: Called by the project proposer to request the release of funds for a completed project milestone, pending verification.
8.  `verifyMilestoneCompletion()`: A governance-controlled function to verify project milestones. Upon successful verification, funds are released to the project proposer, and additional IP is awarded.
9.  `distributeRewards()`: A governance-controlled function to periodically distribute CFLOW rewards from the protocol's treasury to network participants, based on their contributions and IP.
10. `registerVerifiedCarbonOffsetNFT()`: Allows approved entities (simulated as "registrars") to officially register external carbon offset NFTs on-chain, associating them with the CarbonFlow ecosystem and optionally minting IP to the owner.
11. `retireCarbonOffsetNFT()`: Marks a previously registered carbon offset NFT as "retired" on-chain, preventing double-counting and optionally granting IP to the retiring user.
12. `slashProjectFunds()`: A governance-controlled function to penalize non-performing projects by reclaiming unspent funds held by the protocol and potentially burning the proposer's IP.
13. `requestIPDecayAdjustment()`: Initiates a governance proposal to change the global Impact Point decay rate, allowing the DAO to adapt its reputation mechanics.
14. `submitOracleReportForImpact()`: (Simulated) Allows a trusted oracle to submit verifiable off-chain impact data for a project, which can then dynamically influence the project's proposer's IP.
15. `getProjectDetails()`: A public view function to retrieve all stored details about a specific project by its ID.
16. `getUserImpactPoints()`: A public view function to get the current Impact Points of any user, taking into account any applicable decay.
17. `getVotingPower()`: A public view function to determine a user's effective voting power, considering their direct IP and any active delegation.
18. `triggerAdaptiveParameterUpdate()`: (Simulated) A governance-controlled function to trigger an 'adaptive' adjustment of other system parameters (like IP minting rate or decay rate), mimicking a dynamic protocol.
19. `emergencyPause()`: Allows the contract owner (or DAO emergency multisig) to pause critical functions in case of a vulnerability or unforeseen event.
20. `withdrawTreasuryFunds()`: A governance-controlled function allowing the DAO to withdraw CFLOW tokens from the contract's treasury for approved operational expenses or re-allocations.
21. `setApprovedCarbonOffsetRegistrar()`: Allows the DAO governance to add or remove addresses that are authorized to register carbon offset NFTs.
22. `getTotalImpactPointsSupply()`: A public view function that returns the total sum of all Impact Points currently in circulation across all users.
