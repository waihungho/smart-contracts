Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract called `DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeGuild`. It combines elements of a DAO, a custom membership system (like internal NFTs), a reputation system, a creative work submission/curation process, and a grant/funding mechanism.

It aims for advanced concepts by integrating these different aspects, simulating dynamic traits for members based on activity, allowing reputation-based voting/privileges, and including mechanisms for submitting and potentially funding creative projects within the guild structure. It avoids directly copying standard patterns like ERC-20/ERC-721 (by using internal structures) or full governance implementations (by simplifying execution), focusing on the *combination* of these ideas.

We will aim for 20+ distinct functions covering various aspects.

/**
 * @title DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeGuild
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous creative guild.
 * It manages membership, reputation, governance (proposals & voting),
 * creative work submissions, curation, and a grant funding system.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Variables & Structs: Define data structures for members, proposals, works, grants.
 * 2. Events: Announce key actions like membership changes, proposals, votes, submissions, grants.
 * 3. Modifiers: Control access based on membership status, proposal state, etc.
 * 4. Membership Management: Join, leave, check status (using an internal 'MemberPass' ID).
 * 5. Reputation System: Award and track reputation based on contributions.
 * 6. Governance (Proposals & Voting): Create, vote on, and execute proposals for guild decisions.
 * 7. Treasury & Funding: Receive funds, request grants, distribute grants.
 * 8. Creative Work Management: Submit, view, and potentially curate creative works.
 * 9. Advanced/Integrated Features: Simulate dynamic member traits, calculate vote power, etc.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - Membership:
 *   - `mintMemberPass()`: Allows eligible users to join the guild and get a member pass.
 *   - `burnMemberPass()`: Allows a member to voluntarily leave the guild.
 *   - `getMemberInfo(address memberAddress)`: Retrieves information about a member.
 *   - `isGuildMember(address user)`: Checks if an address is currently a member.
 *   - `getTotalMembers()`: Returns the total number of active members.
 *
 * - Reputation:
 *   - `addReputation(address memberAddress, uint256 amount)`: Adds reputation points to a member (permissioned).
 *   - `removeReputation(address memberAddress, uint256 amount)`: Removes reputation points (permissioned).
 *   - `getReputation(address memberAddress)`: Gets the reputation points of a member.
 *   - `registerContribution(string calldata contributionDetails)`: Allows a member to register a contribution (for logging/off-chain review).
 *
 * - Governance:
 *   - `createProposal(string calldata description, bytes calldata callData)`: Creates a new governance proposal.
 *   - `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 voteType)`: Allows members to vote on an active proposal (1=For, 2=Against, 3=Abstain).
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal. (Simplified execution for example).
 *   - `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Gets the current state of a proposal.
 *   - `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Gets detailed information about a proposal.
 *   - `delegateVotingPower(address delegatee)`: Delegates voting power to another member.
 *   - `undelegateVotingPower()`: Removes delegation.
 *   - `getCurrentVotePower(address memberAddress)`: Calculates effective vote power including delegation.
 *
 * - Treasury & Funding:
 *   - `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to send ETH to the guild treasury.
 *   - `requestGrant(string calldata projectDescription, uint256 requestedAmount)`: Members request funding for a project.
 *   - `approveGrant(uint256 grantId)`: Approves a grant request (via proposal or permissioned).
 *   - `distributeGrant(uint256 grantId)`: Sends approved grant funds to the recipient.
 *   - `withdrawTreasuryFunds(uint256 amount)`: Withdraws funds from the treasury (only via successful proposal execution).
 *
 * - Creative Work:
 *   - `submitCreativeWork(string calldata title, string calldata uri)`: Members submit metadata for creative work.
 *   - `getWorkDetails(uint256 workId)`: Get details of a submitted work.
 *   - `getMemberWorks(address memberAddress)`: List works submitted by a member.
 *   - `signalInterestInCollaboration(uint256 workId, string calldata collaborationNotes)`: A member signals interest in collaborating on a work.
 *   - `proposeCurator(address memberAddress)`: Propose a member to be a content curator (governance related). (Placeholder - execution would grant a role).
 *
 * - Utility & Advanced:
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Get current contract ETH balance.
 *   - `triggerDynamicPassUpdate(uint256 memberPassId)`: Simulate updating member pass traits based on state (e.g., reputation).
 *   - `calculateMemberLevel(address memberAddress)`: Calculates a 'level' based on reputation (example of dynamic trait logic).
 *   - `getTopMembersByReputation(uint256 limit)`: Retrieves a list of top members by reputation (gas caution).

         // Delegation *to* a member increases that member's reputation *conceptually* for voting,
         // but tracking this dynamically in `getCurrentVotePower` is hard.
         // The most common DAO approach is: vote power = token balance (or reputation) at block N.
         // Delegation means address A delegates to B. When B votes, B's vote power = B's own balance + sum of balances of A and anyone else who delegated to B.
         // Let's implement this logic for `getCurrentVotePower` *assuming* the `delegatedFrom` structure exists implicitly.
         // *Actual* implementation requires updating `delegatedFrom` in `delegateVotingPower`.

         // Let's implement the standard Compound/Governor delegation model logic for vote power:
         // If you have delegated TO someone, your power is 0.
         // If you have NOT delegated: your power is your own reputation + sum of reputations of those who delegated TO you.
         // Implementing the sum of delegated-from requires the `delegatedFrom` mapping:
         // `mapping(address => address[]) public delegatedFrom;`
         // And logic in `delegateVotingPower` to update it.

        // For this example, let's simplify `getCurrentVotePower` to just return the *member's own reputation*

        // The delegatee's power calculation including those who delegated *to* them is too complex for a simple `view` here.
