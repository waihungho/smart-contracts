/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative Storytelling (DCS) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant (Generated)
 * @notice This smart contract enables collaborative storytelling where users contribute sentences to build a collective narrative.
 * It introduces a novel approach by incorporating a bonding curve for story points (tokens) and a decay mechanism to manage story coherence and prevent stagnation.
 * The contract also includes a dispute resolution mechanism for resolving conflicts related to sentence acceptance.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **StoryPoint (Token) Management:**
 *     *   Custom ERC20-like token for managing contributions.
 *     *   Bonding curve for buying and selling tokens, rewarding early contributors.
 * 2.  **Sentence Submission and Voting:**
 *     *   Users submit sentences with a deposit of story points.
 *     *   Voting mechanism (simple upvote/downvote) to determine if a sentence is accepted.
 *     *   Decay mechanism: Older sentences have less voting power to ensure story evolution.
 * 3.  **Dispute Resolution:**
 *     *   If a vote is close, a dispute can be raised, involving a committee of stakers.
 *     *   Stakers stake StoryPoints to support or reject the sentence.
 *     *   A final vote determines the outcome, and stakers are rewarded or penalized.
 * 4.  **Story Assembly and Display:**
 *     *   Accepted sentences are concatenated to form the story.
 *     *   Retrieval function to display the current story.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *  - `constructor(string memory _storyTitle, string memory _storyDescription, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Initializes the contract with a title, description, and initial bonding curve price.
 *  - `buyStoryPoints(uint256 _ethAmount) payable`:  Buys StoryPoints using ETH via the bonding curve.
 *  - `sellStoryPoints(uint256 _storyPointAmount)`: Sells StoryPoints for ETH via the bonding curve.
 *  - `submitSentence(string memory _sentence)`: Submits a new sentence to the story, requiring a deposit of StoryPoints.
 *  - `voteOnSentence(uint256 _sentenceId, bool _upvote)`: Allows users to vote on a submitted sentence.
 *  - `raiseDispute(uint256 _sentenceId)`:  Allows users to raise a dispute if the voting is close.
 *  - `stakeOnSentence(uint256 _sentenceId, bool _support, uint256 _amount)`: Allows stakers to stake StoryPoints in support or rejection of a sentence.
 *  - `resolveDispute(uint256 _sentenceId)`:  Resolves a disputed sentence.
 *  - `withdrawRewards(uint256 _sentenceId)`: Allows stakers to withdraw rewards after dispute resolution.
 *  - `getStory()`:  Returns the current complete story.
 *  - `getSentence(uint256 _sentenceId)`: Returns a specific sentence's data.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a high-level overview of the contract's functionality at the top.
* **StoryPoint Token with Bonding Curve:** Uses a bonding curve for buying and selling StoryPoints, incentivizing early participation and funding the project.  This is a common and potentially lucrative mechanism. The bonding curve is *simplified* to its most basic form; real-world bonding curves are more complex and handle slippage and liquidity provider fees (but this is fine for a proof-of-concept).
* **Sentence Submission, Voting, and Decay:** Users submit sentences with StoryPoint deposits, and others vote on them.
* **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Includes a system for raising and resolving disputes with staking, adding a layer of governance.  This is the most novel part of the contract.  It allows for situations where the initial voting results are close or controversial.
* **Staking Rewards/Penalties:**  Stakers are rewarded if they correctly predict whether a sentence will be accepted and penalized if they are wrong.  This incentivizes thoughtful participation.
* **Time-Based Constraints:** Uses modifiers `onlyDuringVotingPeriod`, `onlyDuringDisputePeriod`, and `onlyDuringStakePeriod` to enforce deadlines for actions like voting and staking.
* **Event Emission:** Emits events for key actions, making it easier to track activity on-chain.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to prevent common errors.
* **Getters:** Provides getter functions to retrieve the current story, sentence details, and other information.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:**  This version is *not* written to be specifically resistant to re-entrancy attacks. A real-world contract would need to be carefully audited and possibly use re-entrancy guards, especially in the `withdrawRewards` function where ETH is transferred.  Consider using the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** The `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` statement enables default overflow/underflow protection.  In earlier versions, SafeMath libraries would be needed.
    * **DoS (Denial of Service):** Be aware that if the `currentStory` becomes extremely long, reading or writing to it could become expensive and potentially DoS the contract.  Strategies for mitigating this would include limiting the length of individual sentences or implementing a more complex storage mechanism.
* **Upgradeable Architecture**: Not implemented, but is essential for real-world applications.  You'd typically use a Proxy pattern.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The code is not heavily optimized for gas.  In production, you'd need to consider using more efficient data structures, minimizing storage reads/writes, and carefully tuning the bonding curve calculations.

**How to Use the Contract (Conceptual):**

1. **Deploy:** Deploy the contract with a title, description, and initial StoryPoint price.
2. **Buy StoryPoints:** Users buy StoryPoints using ETH via `buyStoryPoints`.
3. **Submit Sentences:** Users submit sentences, paying the required StoryPoint deposit.
4. **Vote:** Users vote on submitted sentences.
5. **Raise Disputes:** If the voting is close, users can raise disputes.
6. **Stake:** Stakers stake StoryPoints to support or reject disputed sentences.
7. **Resolve Disputes:** The contract owner or a designated resolver resolves disputes.
8. **Withdraw Rewards:** Stakers who correctly predicted the outcome can withdraw their rewards.
9. **Read the Story:** Users can retrieve the current story using `getStory`.

This provides a solid foundation for a creative and engaging decentralized storytelling platform!  Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a live network.
