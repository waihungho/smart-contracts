Okay, let's design a smart contract based on a metaphorical concept inspired by quantum mechanics: a token whose state can be in "superposition" until an "observation" collapses it into a definite state, potentially yielding a reward or penalty based on randomness. This requires combining token standards, staking/locking, verifiable randomness, and state management.

We'll call it the **QuantumStateToken (QST)**.

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Name:** `QuantumStateToken`
2.  **Concept:** A token (`QST`) that users can stake into a "superposition" state. While in superposition, tokens are illiquid. Users can initiate an "Observation" process for their superposition tokens. This process utilizes Chainlink VRF to generate verifiable randomness, which then determines the outcome (reward or penalty) when the state "collapses".
3.  **Core Features:**
    *   ERC-20 Standard Compliance for standard token operations.
    *   Staking/Locking into a "Superposition" state.
    *   Initiating "Observation" via a function call, requiring a fee.
    *   Verifiable Randomness using Chainlink VRF to determine Observation outcomes.
    *   Collapse Logic: Based on randomness, superposition tokens return to the standard state, and an additional amount (reward or penalty) is applied.
    *   Configuration by Owner: Adjusting observation cost, reward/penalty ranges, VRF parameters.
    *   Emergency Withdrawal: A mechanism for users to withdraw from superposition prematurely, potentially with a penalty.
    *   Token Rescue: Owner can recover other ERC-20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract.
4.  **Advanced Concepts Used:**
    *   Combining Staking/Locking with a standard token (ERC-20).
    *   State-dependent token properties (Superposition vs. Standard).
    *   Integration with Chainlink VRF for decentralized, verifiable randomness.
    *   Managing asynchronous callbacks (`fulfillRandomWords` from VRF).
    *   Handling internal state transitions based on external factors (randomness).
    *   Reentrancy Protection.
5.  **Function Summary:** (Listed below the outline, before the code)

**Function Summary:**

*   **Standard ERC-20 Functions (Inherited):**
    *   `constructor`: Initializes ERC20, Ownable, and VRF.
    *   `name()`: Returns token name.
    *   `symbol()`: Returns token symbol.
    *   `decimals()`: Returns token decimals.
    *   `totalSupply()`: Returns total supply of *standard* tokens (excluding superposition). *Note: We'll track total supply including superposition separately or adjust `totalSupply` view.* Let's make `totalSupply` represent the total *minted* supply, and provide separate views for standard and superposition balances.
    *   `balanceOf(address account)`: Returns standard token balance.
    *   `transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers standard tokens.
    *   `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers standard tokens via allowance.
    *   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approves spending standard tokens.
    *   `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Returns allowance for standard tokens.
*   **Ownable Functions (Inherited):**
    *   `owner()`: Returns contract owner.
    *   `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
*   **VRFConsumerBaseV2 Functions (Inherited):**
    *   `rawFulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords)`: Callback function from VRF coordinator. *Internal function, not directly callable by users.*
*   **Custom QuantumStateToken Functions:**
    *   `getTotalMintedSupply()`: Returns the total supply including tokens in superposition.
    *   `getStandardBalance(address account)`: Returns the user's balance of tokens in the standard state.
    *   `getSuperpositionBalance(address account)`: Returns the user's balance of tokens locked in the superposition state.
    *   `getTotalSupplyInSuperposition()`: Returns the total amount of tokens currently in superposition across all users.
    *   `enterSuperposition(uint256 amount)`: Moves a specified amount of tokens from the user's standard balance into the superposition state.
    *   `requestObservation(uint256 amountToObserve)`: Initiates the observation process for a specified amount of the user's superposition tokens. Requires sending native currency (e.g., ETH) for the observation fee. Requests randomness from Chainlink VRF. Allows only one pending request per user.
    *   `fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords)`: *Overrides* the inherited function. This is the core logic where the VRF randomness is received, the superposition state collapses, and rewards/penalties are applied based on the random outcome and the `amountToObserve` linked to the `requestId`.
    *   `emergencyWithdrawSuperposition(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to forcefully withdraw tokens from superposition before observation, incurring a penalty.
    *   `setObservationCost(uint256 cost)`: Owner function to set the native currency cost required to initiate an observation.
    *   `setRewardPenaltyRange(int256 minPercentage, int256 maxPercentage)`: Owner function to set the minimum and maximum percentage change (scaled by 10000, e.g., -10000 for -100%, 5000 for +50%) applied during collapse based on the random outcome.
    *   `setEmergencyWithdrawPenalty(uint256 penaltyPercentage)`: Owner function to set the percentage penalty applied during an emergency withdrawal.
    *   `setVRFConfig(uint64 subId, bytes32 keyHash, uint32 callbackGasLimit, uint16 requestConfirmations)`: Owner function to update Chainlink VRF configuration parameters.
    *   `addConsumerToVRFSubscription(address consumerAddress)`: Owner function to add this contract as a consumer to the specified VRF subscription ID.
    *   `removeConsumerFromVRFSubscription(address consumerAddress)`: Owner function to remove this contract as a consumer from the VRF subscription.
    *   `withdrawLink(uint256 amount)`: Owner function to withdraw excess LINK tokens from the contract (needed for VRF fees).
    *   `viewObservationCost()`: Public view function to check the current observation cost.
    *   `viewRewardPenaltyRange()`: Public view function to check the current reward/penalty range.
    *   `viewEmergencyWithdrawPenalty()`: Public view function to check the current emergency withdrawal penalty.
    *   `viewPendingRequest(address account)`: Public view function to check if a user has a pending VRF request and its details.
    *   `viewLastCollapseOutcome(uint256 requestId)`: Public view function to check the outcome of a specific, completed collapse request ID.
    *   `rescueERCMaybeTokens(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Owner function to rescue lost ERC20 tokens (other than QST itself) sent to the contract address.
    *   `getVRFSubscriptionId()`: Public view function for VRF sub ID.
    *   `getVRFKeyHash()`: Public view function for VRF key hash.
    *   `getVRFCallbackGasLimit()`: Public view function for VRF gas limit.
    *   `getVRFRequestConfirmations()`: Public view function for VRF confirmations.

This gives us 26 public/external functions (6 ERC20 + 2 Ownable + 18 Custom). `rawFulfillRandomWords` is internal but crucial. `fulfillRandomWords` overrides it and is external due to the VRF callback mechanism.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Quantum Metaphor:** The "superposition" state and "observation/collapse" mechanism provide a unique theme not commonly found in standard token contracts. It's a creative way to implement a locking/staking mechanism with a probabilistic outcome.
2.  **State-Dependent Balances:** The contract distinguishes between a standard, transferable ERC-20 balance and a locked "superposition" balance. This isn't just a simple lock-up; it's a state that can transition via a specific, random event.
3.  **Chainlink VRF Integration:** Using VRF (`VRFConsumerBaseV2`) provides verifiable, tamper-proof randomness for the collapse outcome. This is a crucial part of the concept, preventing manipulation of the rewards/penalties. This involves understanding subscription management, requesting randomness asynchronously, and handling the `fulfillRandomWords` callback.
4.  **Asynchronous State Update:** The `requestObservation` function doesn't immediately resolve the state. It triggers an external process (VRF), and the state change (`fulfillRandomWords`) happens later in a separate transaction initiated by the VRF coordinator. Managing this asynchronous flow and linking the request ID to the user and amount is key.
5.  **Probabilistic Outcome:** The collapse outcome (reward/penalty) is determined by mapping the verifiable random number to a defined range. This adds a gambling-like or uncertain element to the staked tokens.
6.  **Multiple Balance Tracking:** The contract needs to track total supply, standard balances (using inherited `_balances`), and superposition balances (`_superpositionBalances`). The `totalSupply` function is overridden or supplemented (`getTotalMintedSupply`, `getStandardBalance`, `getSuperpositionBalance`) to provide a clear picture of token distribution.
7.  **Request State Management:** The `s_requests` mapping and `s_pendingRequestID` are used to track ongoing VRF requests, ensuring that the correct user and amount are processed when the randomness arrives and preventing users from having multiple observations pending simultaneously for simplicity.
8.  **Parameter Configurability:** Owner functions allow dynamic adjustment of costs, reward/penalty ranges, and VRF parameters, adding flexibility to the protocol.
9.  **Emergency Escape Hatch:** The `emergencyWithdrawSuperposition` function provides a user-centric escape hatch, though with a penalty, which is a common pattern in staking contracts but here tied to the specific superposition state.
10. **ERC20 Rescue:** Includes a standard best practice (`rescueERCMaybeTokens`) but is crucial for recovering potential lost funds if other tokens are sent to the contract.

This contract moves beyond a basic ERC-20 or a simple staking contract by introducing state-dependent behavior governed by external, verifiable randomness, embodying a creative and somewhat advanced concept within the EVM constraints.
