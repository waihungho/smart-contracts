This smart contract, **KnowledgeForge**, introduces a novel concept for a decentralized knowledge marketplace. It incentivizes the contribution and validation of insights (data, predictions, analysis) on various topics, using an adaptive reputation system, dynamic pricing for access, and utility-driven NFTs. The core idea is that the value of an insight and its contributor's standing in the community are directly tied to the *proven accuracy* and utility of their contributions, verified over time through oracle-backed outcomes or community validation.

It aims to go beyond simple prediction markets by fostering a long-term ecosystem where high-quality, validated knowledge is rewarded and made accessible based on its merit.

### **KnowledgeForge: Contract Outline & Function Summary**

**Core Concept:** A decentralized platform for contributing, validating, and monetizing insights on various topics, featuring an adaptive reputation system, dynamic pricing, and utility-driven NFTs.

**Key Advanced Concepts:**
*   **Adaptive Reputation System:** Reputation dynamically adjusts based on the validated accuracy of submitted insights, influencing rewards and access.
*   **Oracle-Backed Validation:** Outcomes of topics and individual insights are (conceptually) verified by trusted oracles to determine accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Insight Pricing:** Access fees for insights are calculated based on their proven accuracy, contributor reputation, and market demand.
*   **Utility-Driven Insight NFTs:** Contributors can mint NFTs for exceptionally accurate and impactful insights, granting ownership and potential future royalties.
*   **Staking & Incentives:** Users stake funds for submitting insights and validating outcomes, ensuring commitment and deterring malicious behavior.
*   **Upgradeable Architecture:** Implements UUPS proxy pattern for future updates without deploying new contracts.
*   **Role-Based Moderation:** Introduces a moderator role for topic management and resolution.
