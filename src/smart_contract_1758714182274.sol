Here's a Solidity smart contract, `SynergyNexus`, designed around a dynamic reputation system, adaptive governance, and a structured framework for collaborative idea incubation and knowledge sharing. It aims to create a meritocratic DAO where contributions and expertise significantly influence decision-making, moving beyond simple token-based voting.

This contract has **25 distinct functions**, ensuring it meets the specified requirements for quantity, while focusing on advanced, creative, and trendy concepts like:

*   **Dynamic, Soulbound Reputation (SynergyScore):** A non-transferable score that evolves based on on-chain activities, contributions, and potential penalties.
*   **Adaptive Governance:** Voting power is not just tied to token holdings but is dynamically weighted by a user's SynergyScore, promoting active and reputable participation.
*   **Soulbound-like Roles (SynergyRoles):** Non-transferable roles assigned to members, granting specific permissions and recognition within the DAO.
*   **Structured Idea Incubation:** A framework for submitting, reviewing, funding, and tracking projects (Catalyst Proposals and Milestones).
*   **Decentralized Knowledge Base:** A system for community-curated knowledge fragments (e.g., research, best practices) that can be submitted, approved, and rated.

### **SynergyNexus: Dynamic Reputation & Adaptive Governance DAO**

This contract establishes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) centered around a dynamic reputation system ("SynergyScore"), adaptive governance, and a framework for idea incubation. It aims to foster a meritocratic environment where contributions, expertise, and peer consensus drive collective decision-making and project funding, minimizing direct token-whale influence.

### **Function Summary**

**A. Core Administration & Setup**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes the DAO with an initial admin, and defines initial governance parameters such as voting period, quorum, proposal thresholds, and the impact factor of SynergyScore on voting power.
2.  `updateAdmin`: Allows the current admin to transfer administrative control to a new address. This uses the `Ownable` base contract's `transferOwnership` function.
3.  `setDependencies`: Sets or updates external contract addresses, specifically the `governanceToken` address. This provides flexibility for integration.
4.  `setGovernanceParameters`: Allows the admin to adjust key DAO governance parameters such as `votingPeriodBlocks`, `quorumNumerator`, `quorumDenominator`, `proposalThresholdAmount`, and `synergyWeightFactor`.

**B. SynergyScore & Reputation System (Soulbound & Dynamic)**

5.  `getSynergyScore`: Retrieves an address's current non-transferable and dynamically evolving SynergyScore.
6.  `awardContributionPoints`: Awards points to a specific address for valuable on-chain contributions or verified positive actions, directly impacting their SynergyScore. Only callable by `CouncilMember` roles.
7.  `penalizeSynergyScore`: Reduces an address's SynergyScore for detrimental actions or verified misconduct, impacting their standing. Only callable by `CouncilMember` roles.

**C. Adaptive Governance & Proposals**

8.  `submitCatalystProposal`: Allows any member with a minimum SynergyScore and token balance to submit a detailed project proposal for funding and collective review. Includes target address and calldata for on-chain execution.
9.  `voteOnProposal`: Enables members to vote on active proposals. Their voting power is dynamically calculated as a sum of their governance token holdings and their SynergyScore, weighted by `synergyWeightFactor`.
10. `delegateSynergyVote`: Allows a member to delegate their combined voting power (SynergyScore + token weight) to another address, enhancing collective decision efficiency.
11. `undelegateSynergyVote`: Revokes a previous vote delegation, returning voting power to the original delegator.
12. `executeProposal`: Finalizes a passed proposal. If successful, it triggers its defined actions (e.g., fund disbursement, role assignment, parameter change via `target.call`). If it fails or quorum is not met, the proposal is marked as `Defeated`.
13. `cancelProposal`: Allows designated `CouncilMember` roles or the admin to cancel a proposal under specific, pre-defined conditions (e.g., malicious, technically impossible).

**D. Dynamic Role Assignments & Identity (Soulbound Tokens - SBT-like)**

14. `assignSynergyRole`: Assigns a non-transferable "SynergyRole" (represented by an internal SBT-like identifier) to an address, granting specific permissions or recognition. Only callable by `CouncilMember` roles.
15. `revokeSynergyRole`: Removes an assigned SynergyRole from an address, typically due to changing responsibilities or misconduct. Only callable by `CouncilMember` roles.
16. `getAssignedSynergyRoles`: Retrieves all active SynergyRoles for a given address, displaying their current organizational standing.

**E. Idea Incubation & Project Lifecycle**

17. `submitProjectMilestone`: A project lead (assigned via proposal execution) submits a specific milestone for an approved project, requesting review and potential next-stage funding or resource allocation.
18. `reviewProjectMilestone`: Designated reviewers (e.g., `CouncilMember` or `Auditor` roles) evaluate a submitted milestone's completion and quality, marking it as `Approved` or `Rejected`.
19. `disburseProjectFunds`: Releases funds or allocated resources to a project upon successful milestone review and approval. Only callable by `CouncilMember` roles.
20. `reportProjectProgress`: Allows project leads to submit informal progress updates, attach external links (e.g., IPFS hashes of reports), or provide commentary without direct on-chain state changes.

**F. Decentralized Knowledge Base (Curated Fragments)**

21. `submitKnowledgeFragment`: Members with a minimum SynergyScore can propose valuable knowledge (e.g., research, best practices, technical insights) by providing a URI (e.g., IPFS hash) and metadata.
22. `approveKnowledgeFragment`: Designated `CouncilMember` roles or expert role-holders approve a knowledge fragment for inclusion in the curated knowledge base.
23. `getKnowledgeFragmentDetails`: Retrieves comprehensive details of a submitted knowledge fragment from the knowledge base.
24. `rateKnowledgeFragment`: Allows members with a minimum SynergyScore to provide feedback by rating the utility or quality of an approved knowledge fragment (upvote/downvote), influencing its visibility and perceived value.

**G. Treasury Management**

25. `withdrawTreasuryFunds`: This function provides a mechanism for treasury withdrawals. While direct calls are restricted, it's designed to be executed as part of a passed governance proposal via the `executeProposal` function (specifically, when `proposal.target.call(proposal.callData)` targets this function with appropriate calldata). This ensures all treasury outflows are subject to DAO governance.
