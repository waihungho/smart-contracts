 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * This contract facilitates:
 *  - Membership management via Membership NFTs with tiered access.
 *  - Decentralized art submission and curation through voting rounds.
 *  - Collaborative art creation with shared ownership and royalty distribution.
 *  - Decentralized exhibitions and virtual gallery management.
 *  - Community governance through proposals and voting using DAO tokens.
 *  - Dynamic revenue sharing and artist compensation mechanisms.
 *  - On-chain reputation system based on contribution and curation.
 *  - Integration with decentralized storage (IPFS) for artwork metadata.
 *  - Support for fractionalized NFT ownership of collective artworks.
 *  - Advanced dispute resolution mechanism for art ownership and rights.
 *  - Integration with external oracles for real-world art market data.
 *  - Gamified art discovery and engagement features.
 *  - Support for generative art and AI-assisted creation within the collective.
 *  - Decentralized identity integration for artists and members.
 *  - Dynamic membership fee and revenue model adjustments through governance.
 *  - Cross-chain art collaboration and asset management (concept - requires bridging/oracles).
 *  - Educational resources and workshops for members within the DAAC ecosystem.
 *  - Built-in analytics dashboard for collective activity and performance (concept - data available on-chain).
 *  - Support for physical art integration and provenance tracking (concept - requires real-world integration).
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Membership & Access:**
 * 1. `becomeMember(uint8 _membershipTier)`: Allows users to become members by minting a Membership NFT for a specific tier.
 * 2. `upgradeMembership(uint8 _newTier)`: Allows members to upgrade their membership tier.
 * 3. `revokeMembership(address _memberAddress)`: Allows the contract owner to revoke a member's membership (admin function).
 * 4. `getMembershipTier(address _memberAddress)`: Returns the membership tier of a given address.
 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 5. `submitArtwork(string _artworkMetadataURI)`: Allows members to submit artwork proposals with IPFS metadata URI.
 * 6. `startCurationRound()`: Starts a new curation round, allowing members to vote on submitted artworks (admin function).
 * 7. `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on an artwork during a curation round.
 * 8. `endCurationRound()`: Ends the current curation round, tallies votes, and approves artworks based on quorum (admin function).
 * 9. `getArtworkStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the status of a submitted artwork (pending, approved, rejected).
 *
 * **Collaborative Art & Ownership:**
 * 10. `createCollaborativeArtwork(string _artworkTitle, string[] memory _artistAddresses, string _initialMetadataURI)`: Creates a collaborative artwork with multiple initial artists.
 * 11. `addCollaboratorToArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address _newArtist)`: Adds a new artist as a collaborator to an existing collaborative artwork (governance/artist proposal).
 * 12. `setArtworkMetadataURI(uint256 _artworkId, string _newMetadataURI)`: Allows approved artists to update the metadata URI of an artwork.
 * 13. `getArtworkArtists(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the list of artists associated with a collaborative artwork.
 * 14. `getArtworkOwnershipShares(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the ownership shares of each artist in a collaborative artwork.
 *
 * **Exhibitions & Gallery:**
 * 15. `createExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Creates a virtual exhibition with a title and time frame (admin function).
 * 16. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds an approved artwork to an exhibition (admin function).
 * 17. `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts a scheduled exhibition (admin function).
 * 18. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends a running exhibition (admin function).
 * 19. `getExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns the list of artworks in a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **Governance & DAO Token (Conceptual):**
 * 20. `createGovernanceProposal(string _proposalDescription, bytes _calldata)`: Allows members with DAO tokens to create governance proposals.
 * 21. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members with DAO tokens to vote on governance proposals.
 * 22. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal (admin/governance function).
 * 23. `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the status of a governance proposal (pending, active, passed, failed, executed).
 *
 * **Utility & Information:**
 * 24. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the total number of members in the DAAC.
 * 25. `getArtworkCount()`: Returns the total number of submitted artworks.
 * 26. `getCurationRoundStatus()`: Returns the status of the current curation round (inactive, active).
 * 27. `getContractBalance()`: Returns the contract's ETH balance.
 * 28. `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw funds from the contract (admin function).
