Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced concepts: a dynamic, reputation-based collective intelligence/resource allocation system.

It will feature:
1.  **Staking:** Users stake tokens to participate.
2.  **Non-Transferable Reputation (`InsightScore`):** Earned by constructive participation (proposing, voting) and potentially lost by destructive actions.
3.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Key contract parameters (like staking minimums, voting thresholds, proposal costs) are *not* fixed but can be adjusted by special governance proposals.
4.  **Tiered Influence:** Governance weight or ability to propose/execute might depend on both staked tokens *and* `InsightScore`.
5.  **Complex Proposal Lifecycle:** Proposals require funding, voting, and explicit execution.
6.  **Conditional Execution:** Proposals only execute if multiple conditions (token votes, score thresholds, funding) are met.
7.  **Simulated Oracle/VRF Integration:** Hooks for potential external data (like evaluating proposal success) or randomness (like picking a featured proposal).
8.  **Treasury Management:** Collective control over pooled resources.

This design avoids directly copying standard ERC20, ERC721, or basic DAO templates by combining these mechanics into a unique system focused on evolving, reputation-weighted collective decision-making.

**Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumQuorum`

**Concept Summary:**
A decentralized collective intelligence and resource allocation system where users stake tokens (`InsightTokens`) to become members. Participation earns non-transferable reputation (`InsightScore`). Key protocol parameters are dynamically adjustable via collective governance. Resource allocation and protocol changes happen through a complex proposal lifecycle weighted by both stake and reputation.

**Key Features:**
*   Staking-based Membership
*   Non-transferable Reputation (`InsightScore`)
*   Dynamic Protocol Parameters
*   Multi-factor Governance (Stake + Reputation)
*   Complex Proposal Lifecycle (Propose, Fund, Vote, Execute)
*   Simulated external interaction points (Oracles/VRF)
*   Managed Collective Treasury

**State Variables:**
*   `insightToken`: Address of the ERC20 staking token.
*   `treasuryAddress`: Address where collective funds are held (could be the contract itself or external).
*   `admin`: Initial admin for parameter setup (renounceable).
*   `userStake`: Mapping from address to staked token amount.
*   `userInsightScore`: Mapping from address to non-transferable score.
*   `parameters`: Mapping from `bytes32` (parameter name hash) to `uint256` (parameter value). Stores all dynamic parameters.
*   `proposals`: Mapping from `uint256` (proposal ID) to `Proposal` struct.
*   `activeProposalIds`: Array of current active proposal IDs.
*   `proposalCount`: Counter for unique proposal IDs.

**Structs:**
*   `Proposal`: Defines the structure for governance proposals.
    *   `id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `proposer`: Address of the proposal creator.
    *   `proposalType`: Enum (`DataProposal`, `ProtocolAdjustment`).
    *   `state`: Enum (`Pending`, `Active`, `VotingClosed`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`).
    *   `creationTimestamp`: Block timestamp when created.
    *   `votingDeadline`: Block timestamp when voting ends.
    *   `requiredFunding`: Tokens required to activate voting.
    *   `currentFunding`: Tokens currently funded.
    *   `votesFor`: Mapping from address to bool (voted For).
    *   `votesAgainst`: Mapping from address to bool (voted Against).
    *   `voteCountFor`: Total votes for.
    *   `voteCountAgainst`: Total votes against.
    *   `totalStakeVotedFor`: Total staked tokens voting For.
    *   `totalStakeVotedAgainst`: Total staked tokens voting Against.
    *   `totalScoreVotedFor`: Total insight score voting For.
    *   `totalScoreVotedAgainst`: Total insight score voting Against.
    *   `detailsHash`: IPFS or content hash for proposal details.
    *   `protocolParamUpdates`: Array of `ParamUpdate` structs (if `ProtocolAdjustment`).
    *   `executionPayload`: Bytes data for `DataProposal` execution (e.g., target address, function signature, parameters).
    *   `executed`: Bool indicating successful execution (for `DataProposal`).

*   `ParamUpdate`: Defines a single protocol parameter change.
    *   `paramNameHash`: `bytes32` hash of the parameter name.
    *   `newValue`: `uint256` new value for the parameter.

**Enums:**
*   `ProposalType`: `DataProposal`, `ProtocolAdjustment`.
*   `ProposalState`: `Pending`, `Active`, `VotingClosed`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`.

**Function Summary:**

*   **Admin & Setup:**
    1.  `constructor(address _insightToken, address _treasuryAddress)`: Initializes the contract with token and treasury addresses.
    2.  `setInitialParameters(bytes32[] _names, uint256[] _values)`: Admin sets initial dynamic parameters.
    3.  `renounceAdmin()`: Admin renounces their role.

*   **Membership & Reputation:**
    4.  `stakeInsightTokens(uint256 amount)`: Stake tokens to become or remain a member.
    5.  `unstakeInsightTokens(uint256 amount)`: Request unstake (potentially with cooldown, not implemented for brevity but conceptually possible).
    6.  `isMember(address account)`: Check if an account meets the minimum stake requirement.
    7.  `getInsightScore(address account)`: Get the insight score of an account.
    8.  `_increaseInsightScore(address account, uint256 amount)`: Internal: Increase insight score.
    9.  `_decreaseInsightScore(address account, uint256 amount)`: Internal: Decrease insight score (slashing).

*   **Dynamic Parameters:**
    10. `getParameter(bytes32 nameHash)`: Get the current value of a dynamic parameter.
    11. `_setParameter(bytes32 nameHash, uint256 value)`: Internal: Set a dynamic parameter (only via successful ProtocolAdjustment proposal execution).

*   **Proposal Management:**
    12. `createDataProposal(string detailsHash, uint256 requiredFunding, address target, bytes executionPayload)`: Create a proposal for resource allocation or arbitrary contract interaction.
    13. `createProtocolAdjustmentProposal(string detailsHash, uint256 requiredFunding, ParamUpdate[] _paramUpdates)`: Create a special proposal to change protocol parameters.
    14. `fundProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint256 amount)`: Fund a pending proposal to make it active.
    15. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Cast a vote (For/Against) on an active proposal. Increases voter's `InsightScore` on vote.
    16. `closeVoting(uint256 proposalId)`: Manually close voting after the deadline (anyone can call). Checks outcome.
    17. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Attempt to execute a successful `DataProposal`. Transfers funds or interacts with target.
    18. `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancel a proposal (e.g., proposer can cancel if unfunded/early, or perhaps collective cancel mechanism).

*   **Utility & View:**
    19. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Get detailed information about a proposal.
    20. `getActiveProposalIds()`: Get list of currently active proposal IDs.
    21. `canCreateProposal(address account)`: Check if an account meets criteria to propose.
    22. `canVote(address account)`: Check if an account meets criteria to vote.
    23. `getTreasuryBalance()`: Get the contract's (or treasury address's) token balance.

*   **Simulated Advanced Hooks:**
    24. `simulateVRFFeaturedProposal(uint256 randomNumber)`: Placeholder to simulate VRF picking a random active proposal for 'featuring' (could increase visibility, bonus score, etc.). Doesn't modify state significantly in this demo, but shows hook.
    25. `simulateExternalEvaluationCallback(uint256 proposalId, bool outcomeSuccessful)`: Placeholder to simulate an oracle or external system evaluating the *real-world outcome* of a *previously executed* DataProposal and potentially adjusting scores based on success/failure.

**Explanation of Concepts and Code:**

1.  **Dynamic Parameters (`parameters` mapping, `setParameter` internal, `getParameter` view, `ProtocolAdjustment` proposal):**
    *   Instead of constants or fixed state variables for critical values (like thresholds), they are stored in a mapping keyed by a `bytes32` hash of their name.
    *   They can only be changed if a `ProtocolAdjustment` proposal is created, funded, voted on successfully (using potentially higher thresholds), and then "executed".
    *   The `_setParameter` internal function is the *only* way these values are modified *after* initial setup.
    *   This makes the protocol rules themselves subject to governance.

2.  **Insight Score (`userInsightScore`, `_increaseInsightScore`, `_decreaseInsightScore`, vote/execution logic):**
    *   A `uint256` value associated with each user address, but not directly transferable like an ERC20 token.
    *   Increased for positive participation (currently, only voting successfully, but could extend to proposing, funding).
    *   Decreased (`_decreaseInsightScore`) for negative outcomes (placeholder in `simulateExternalEvaluationCallback` for failed proposals).
    *   This score can be used alongside staked tokens (`userStake`) for voting power or proposal eligibility, creating a multi-dimensional reputation system that rewards active, successful participation over just holding tokens.

3.  **Complex Proposal Lifecycle (Enums, Struct, Functions):**
    *   Proposals go through distinct states: `Pending` (needs funding) -> `Active` (voting) -> `VotingClosed` (outcome decided) -> `Succeeded`/`Failed` -> `Executed` (for `DataProposal`).
    *   Requires explicit actions: `create`, `fund`, `vote`, `closeVoting`, `execute`, `cancel`.
    *   `fundProposal` transitions from `Pending` to `Active`.
    *   `closeVoting` checks the outcome based on multiple factors (`voteCount`, `totalStakeVoted`, `totalScoreVoted`) against dynamic thresholds and transitions to `Succeeded` or `Failed`.
    *   `executeProposal` handles the actual payload call and token transfer for `DataProposal`.

4.  **Multi-Factor Governance (`closeVoting` logic, `canCreateProposal`):**
    *   Winning a vote doesn't just rely on token count (`totalStakeVotedFor` vs `totalStakeVotedAgainst`) or address count (`voteCountFor` vs `voteCountAgainst`), but also `totalScoreVoted` against potentially different thresholds based on proposal type.
    *   `canCreateProposal` checks both stake and a (placeholder) score parameter. This prevents Sybil attacks based purely on tokens and requires some level of earned reputation.

5.  **Simulated External Hooks (`simulateVRFFeaturedProposal`, `simulateExternalEvaluationCallback`):**
    *   These functions show where interaction with oracles (like Chainlink VRF for randomness, or a custom oracle for off-chain data) would occur.
    *   `simulateVRFFeaturedProposal` uses external randomness to pick an active proposal.
    *   `simulateExternalEvaluationCallback` mimics an external oracle reporting on the real-world success of a `DataProposal` (e.g., "was the funded project completed successfully?") and uses this to adjust `InsightScore`, creating a feedback loop between on-chain action and off-chain impact.

6.  **Treasury Management:** The contract holds staked tokens and potentially funded proposal amounts before execution, acting as a collective treasury. Funds for `DataProposal` execution are transferred to the designated `treasuryAddress` (could be the contract itself or another controlled address) before the payload is called.

**Important Considerations & Limitations (as this is a complex demo):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating over mappings (e.g., in a realistic score adjustment for all voters after proposal outcome) is very gas-expensive and should be avoided in production contracts. Real systems use different patterns (e.g., users claiming rewards/penalties, Merkle trees, off-chain computation).
*   **Total Score Calculation:** Calculating the *total* insight score in the system is difficult on-chain without iterating all users. The example uses a placeholder parameter.
*   **Parameter Names:** Using `keccak256("PARAM_NAME")` is common, but requires careful handling of the strings off-chain to interact correctly.
*   **Security:** This is a demonstration and lacks many security considerations a production DAO would need (e.g., re-entrancy guards on all token interactions, careful checks on external calls in `executeProposal`, robust input validation, comprehensive access control on hooks).
*   **Upgradeability:** This contract is not upgradeable. A real DAO might use proxy patterns (like UUPS or Transparent Proxies) for future enhancements.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic `require` statements are used. More detailed error codes/messages might be needed.
*   **Unstaking Cooldowns/Slashing:** A real system would likely have cooldown periods for unstaking and potential slashing of stake (not just score) for malicious actions.
*   **Parameter Defaults:** If `setInitialParameters` isn't called, `getParameter` will return 0, which might cause unexpected behavior if 0 is not a valid minimum.

This contract demonstrates a richer, more dynamic governance model than typical token-weighted systems by introducing non-transferable reputation and self-adjusting protocol parameters.
