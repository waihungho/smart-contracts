/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI (Example - Replace with your name/org)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 *      that enables artists to mint and manage unique digital artworks (NFTs),
 *      participate in collective exhibitions, vote on curatorial decisions,
 *      and share revenue generated through the collective.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * **NFT Management:**
 *   1. `mintArtNFT(string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows approved artists to mint new art NFTs.
 *   2. `transferArtNFT(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`: Transfers ownership of an art NFT.
 *   3. `burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the NFT owner to burn their art NFT.
 *   4. `getArtNFTMetadataURI(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the metadata URI of a specific art NFT.
 *   5. `setArtNFTMetadataURI(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows the NFT owner to update metadata URI.
 *   6. `approveArtNFTTransfer(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)`: Approves an address to transfer an NFT on behalf of the owner.
 *   7. `setApprovalForAllArtNFTs(address _operator, bool _approved)`: Enables or disables approval for all NFTs for an operator.
 *   8. `getArtNFTOwner(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the owner of a specific art NFT.
 *
 * **Collective Membership & Artist Management:**
 *   9. `applyForArtistMembership(string memory _artistStatement)`: Allows users to apply to become artist members.
 *  10. `approveArtistMembership(address _artistAddress)`: Admin function to approve pending artist membership applications.
 *  11. `revokeArtistMembership(address _artistAddress)`: Admin function to revoke artist membership.
 *  12. `isApprovedArtist(address _artistAddress)`: Checks if an address is an approved artist member.
 *
 * **Exhibition & Curatorial Voting:**
 *  13. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _exhibitionDescription)`: Creates a new digital art exhibition.
 *  14. `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artTokenId)`: Allows artists to propose their art NFTs for an exhibition.
 *  15. `startExhibitionCuratorialVote(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts a voting process for selecting artworks for an exhibition (Admin/Curator).
 *  16. `voteForArtInExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artTokenId, bool _vote)`: Approved members vote on artworks proposed for an exhibition.
 *  17. `finalizeExhibitionSelection(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Finalizes the exhibition artwork selection based on voting results (Admin/Curator).
 *  18. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition, including selected artworks.
 *
 * **Revenue Sharing & Collective Governance:**
 *  19. `donateToCollective()`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective fund.
 *  20. `distributeRevenueToArtists()`: Distributes collected revenue to approved artist members (Admin/Curator, based on a predefined mechanism - simplified here).
 *  21. `setAdminAddress(address _newAdmin)`: Admin function to change the contract administrator.
 *  22. `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause certain functionalities of the contract.
 *  23. `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to unpause the contract.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 *   - **NFT Minting & Management:**  Functions to create, transfer, view, and manage digital art NFTs within the collective.
 *   - **Artist Membership:**  Mechanism for artists to apply, be approved, and manage their membership status in the collective.
 *   - **Exhibitions & Curatorial Process:**  Functions to create exhibitions, propose artworks, vote on artwork selection, and finalize exhibition lineups, enabling a decentralized curatorial process.
 *   - **Revenue & Governance:** Functions for donations, revenue distribution among artists, and basic administrative control over the collective.
