 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, enabling artists to submit art,
 *      collectors to purchase, a DAO to govern gallery operations, and dynamic NFT features.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1. `submitArtProposal(string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256 _price)`: Allows artists to submit art proposals for gallery inclusion.
 * 2. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows DAO members to vote on submitted art proposals.
 * 3. `approveArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gallery owner/DAO to finalize art proposal approval after voting.
 * 4. `rejectArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gallery owner/DAO to reject art proposal.
 * 5. `purchaseArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows collectors to purchase approved artwork.
 * 6. `listArtForSale(uint256 _artId, uint256 _price)`: Allows art owners to list their purchased art for resale within the gallery.
 * 7. `cancelArtListing(uint256 _artId)`: Allows art owners to cancel their art listing.
 * 8. `updateArtPrice(uint256 _artId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows art owners to update the listed price of their art.
 * 9. `transferArtOwnership(uint256 _artId, address _newOwner)`: Allows art owners to directly transfer their art to another address (outside marketplace).
 * 10. `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Allows DAO members to create governance proposals to change gallery parameters.
 * 11. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows DAO members to vote on governance proposals.
 * 12. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows execution of passed governance proposals.
 * 13. `stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake tokens to become DAO members and earn rewards.
 * 14. `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to unstake tokens, removing DAO membership.
 * 15. `claimStakingRewards()`: Allows users to claim accumulated staking rewards.
 * 16. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Governance function to set the gallery commission fee.
 * 17. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Gallery owner/DAO function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 * 18. `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Governance function to set the voting duration for proposals.
 * 19. `setQuorum(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`: Governance function to set the quorum percentage for proposals.
 * 20. `verifyArtist(address _artistAddress)`: Gallery owner/DAO function to verify an artist, granting them submission rights.
 * 21. `revokeArtistVerification(address _artistAddress)`: Gallery owner/DAO function to revoke artist verification.
 * 22. `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`:  View function to retrieve details of a specific artwork.
 * 23. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to retrieve details of a specific proposal.
 * 24. `getUserStake(address _user)`: View function to retrieve the staked amount of a user.
 * 25. `getRewardBalance(address _user)`: View function to retrieve the pending reward balance of a user.
