/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Collaborative Art (DAOArt)
 * @author Bard (Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a DAO focused on collaborative art creation, ownership, and governance.
 *
 * Function Outline & Summary:
 *
 * **DAO Membership & Governance:**
 * 1. `joinDAO()`: Allows users to become members of the DAO by paying a membership fee.
 * 2. `leaveDAO()`: Allows members to leave the DAO and potentially receive a refund of membership fee (governance configurable).
 * 3. `proposeRuleChange(string memory _description, bytes memory _data)`: Members can propose changes to DAO rules and parameters.
 * 4. `voteOnRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on proposed rule changes.
 * 5. `executeRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a rule change proposal if it passes the voting threshold.
 * 6. `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power to another address.
 * 7. `revokeDelegation()`: Revokes delegated voting power.
 * 8. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of DAO members.
 * 9. `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the current membership fee.
 * 10. `setMembershipFee(uint256 _newFee)`: (Governance) Sets a new membership fee.
 * 11. `getVotingThreshold()`: Returns the voting threshold percentage for proposals to pass.
 * 12. `setVotingThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: (Governance) Sets a new voting threshold percentage.
 *
 * **Collaborative Art Creation & NFT Management:**
 * 13. `proposeArtProject(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Members can propose new collaborative art projects.
 * 14. `voteOnArtProject(uint256 _projectId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on proposed art projects.
 * 15. `startArtProjectDevelopment(uint256 _projectId)`: (Governance - after project approval) Starts the development phase of an art project.
 * 16. `submitArtProjectForReview(uint256 _projectId, string memory _finalIpfsHash)`: Artists can submit a completed art project for final review.
 * 17. `voteOnArtProjectReview(uint256 _projectId, bool _approve)`: DAO members vote on the final submitted art project.
 * 18. `mintArtNFT(uint256 _projectId)`: (Governance - after review approval) Mints an NFT representing the collaborative art.
 * 19. `getArtProjectDetails(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns details of a specific art project.
 * 20. `getAllArtProjects()`: Returns a list of all art project IDs.
 * 21. `transferArtNFT(uint256 _projectId, address _recipient)`: (Governance) Transfers the ownership of the art NFT (e.g., for sale, distribution).
 * 22. `burnArtNFT(uint256 _projectId)`: (Governance) Burns/destroys the art NFT.
 *
 * **Treasury & Revenue Management:**
 * 23. `getDAOTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the DAO treasury.
 * 24. `withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`: (Governance) Allows withdrawal of funds from the treasury (e.g., for project funding, operational expenses).

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Structure:** The contract implements core DAO principles:
    *   **Membership:** Open membership with a fee mechanism (can be adjusted by governance).
    *   **Governance:** Rule changes and project decisions are made through member proposals and voting.
    *   **Transparency:** All actions and proposals are recorded on the blockchain.
    *   **Community-Driven:**  The DAO is designed to be governed by its members, not a central authority.

2.  **Collaborative Art Focus:** The DAO is specifically tailored for collaborative art creation, which is a creative and trendy use case in the blockchain space, especially with the rise of NFTs and digital art.

3.  **Art Project Lifecycle Management:** The contract manages the entire lifecycle of an art project within the DAO, from proposal and voting to development, review, NFT minting, and potential sale/distribution. This structured approach is more advanced than just simple voting contracts.

4.  **NFT Integration (Simplified In-Contract):** While a real-world DAO would likely interact with a separate, robust NFT contract, this example includes a simplified in-contract NFT minting mechanism to demonstrate the concept of creating and managing digital art assets within the DAO framework. This allows for a self-contained example, even though a separate ERC721/ERC1155 contract would be more production-ready.

5.  **Voting Delegation:** The `delegateVote` function implements a form of liquid democracy, allowing members who may not have time or expertise to vote on every proposal to delegate their voting power to trusted members. This is a feature seen in more advanced governance models.

6.  **Multi-Stage Project Workflow:** The `ArtProject` struct and related functions define a multi-stage workflow (`Proposed`, `Voting`, `Development`, `Review`, `ReviewVoting`, `Minting`, `Minted`, `Completed`, `Rejected`) for art projects, making the process more organized and transparent.

7.  **Review and Approval Process:** The inclusion of a "review" stage and separate voting on the submitted art project adds a layer of quality control and community curation to the art creation process.

8.  **Treasury Management:**  The contract includes basic treasury functionality to manage funds collected from membership fees and potentially future art sales. Governance (though simplified to `onlyOwner` for treasury withdrawal in this example) would ideally control the treasury in a real DAO.

9.  **Proposal Types:** The `ProposalType` enum allows for expansion to different types of proposals beyond just rule changes and art projects, making the DAO more versatile.

10. **Event Emission:**  Extensive use of events throughout the contract makes it easier to track DAO activities and integrate with off-chain applications or user interfaces.

**Important Notes and Disclaimer:**

*   **Simplified Example:** This contract is written as a demonstration of concepts and is **not production-ready**. It lacks robust security features, gas optimization, and comprehensive error handling that would be necessary for a real-world DAO.
*   **Security Audits Required:**  Any smart contract intended for real-world use, especially one managing funds and governance, **must undergo thorough security audits** by experienced Solidity auditors.
*   **Governance Simplification:**  Treasury withdrawal and some administrative functions are simplified to `onlyOwner` for this example. In a true DAO, governance through voting would control these actions.
*   **NFT Simplification:** The in-contract NFT minting is highly simplified and **not ERC721 compliant**. A real DAO would use a separate, well-audited ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT contract.
*   **Member Counting Placeholder:** The `getMemberCount()` function is a **placeholder** and not a robust or efficient way to count members. A real implementation would need a proper member tracking mechanism (e.g., a dynamic array or linked list of members).
*   **Voting Period:** Voting periods (7 days in examples) are hardcoded for simplicity but should be configurable through governance in a real DAO.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The code is not optimized for gas efficiency. Real-world smart contracts should be written with gas optimization in mind.

This example provides a foundation for a creative and advanced smart contract for a DAO focused on collaborative art. Building upon these concepts and addressing the security and robustness concerns would be the next steps in creating a production-ready DAOArt platform.
