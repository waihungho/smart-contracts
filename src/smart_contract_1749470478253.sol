Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that goes beyond simple token transfers or basic DeFi mechanics. How about a "Quantum Vault"?

The idea: A vault that holds ERC-20 tokens, but the conditions for accessing them ("withdrawal") or performing certain actions ("state changes") are determined by complex, configurable "Entanglement Rules." These rules can depend on various factors like time, external oracle data, the state of other vaults/contracts, or even user interactions. The twist is that the "state" determining withdrawal eligibility might be conceptually "superposed" until a specific action ("measurement" or "state collapse trigger") occurs, which evaluates the rules at that moment and finalizes the current outcome.

This allows for:
1.  **Conditional Access:** Funds locked until complex criteria are met.
2.  **Dynamic Outcomes:** The amount withdrawable or available actions can change over time based on external factors and interactions.
3.  **Interdependent Logic:** Rules can link multiple slots or external conditions.
4.  **Collaborative/Delegated Control:** Allowing others to help meet conditions or manage slots.

It's "quantum" in the metaphorical sense â€“ state is not fixed until "observed" (triggered), and rules create complex dependencies ("entanglements").

**QuantumVault Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary**

*   **Contract Name:** `QuantumVault`
*   **Concept:** A token vault where withdrawal and access to funds are governed by configurable "Entanglement Rules". The state determining availability is evaluated (or "collapsed") upon specific triggers or interactions.
*   **Core Features:**
    *   Creation of individual `VaultSlot`s.
    *   Depositing ERC-20 tokens into slots.
    *   Configuring various types of `EntanglementRule`s per slot (time, external data, contract state, interactions, etc.).
    *   Triggering a "State Collapse" to evaluate rules and update the slot's actionable state (e.g., withdrawable amount).
    *   Withdrawing tokens based on the last collapsed state.
    *   Delegation and collaboration on slot management.
    *   Querying current states and rule configurations.
*   **Metaphor:** Funds are in a "superposed" state governed by "quantum entanglement rules" until a "measurement" ("state collapse") determines the current, concrete state.

*   **Function Summary (Public/External Functions):**
    1.  `createVaultSlot(address tokenAddress, uint256 initialDepositAmount, EntanglementRule[] initialRules)`: Creates a new vault slot for the caller, optionally deposits initial tokens, and sets initial rules.
    2.  `depositTokens(uint256 slotId, uint256 amount)`: Deposits additional tokens into an existing slot owned by the caller.
    3.  `withdrawTokens(uint256 slotId, uint256 amount)`: Attempts to withdraw tokens from a slot. Only possible if the amount is available according to the *last collapsed state*.
    4.  `triggerStateCollapse(uint256 slotId)`: Manually triggers the evaluation of all entanglement rules for a slot, updating its internal actionable state (e.g., withdrawable amount). *Note: Withdrawal attempts automatically trigger a check if state is old.*
    5.  `setEntanglementRule(uint256 slotId, EntanglementRule rule)`: Adds or updates an entanglement rule for a slot.
    6.  `removeEntanglementRule(uint256 slotId, bytes32 ruleId)`: Removes an existing rule by its unique ID.
    7.  `configureRuleParameter(uint256 slotId, bytes32 ruleId, uint256 paramIndex, uint256 newValue)`: Updates a specific parameter within an existing rule.
    8.  `transferSlotOwnership(uint256 slotId, address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of a vault slot, including its contents and rules, to a new address.
    9.  `delegateWithdrawal(uint256 slotId, address delegatee, uint256 duration)`: Allows a specified address to withdraw from the slot for a limited time, subject to rules and collapsed state.
    10. `addCollaborator(uint256 slotId, address collaborator)`: Adds an address that can trigger state collapse and potentially configure rules (depending on rule type permissions).
    11. `removeCollaborator(uint256 slotId, address collaborator)`: Removes a collaborator from a slot.
    12. `getSlotState(uint256 slotId)`: Views the current, last-collapsed actionable state of a slot (e.g., how much is currently withdrawable).
    13. `getEntanglementRules(uint256 slotId)`: Views all entanglement rules configured for a slot.
    14. `viewRuleConditionStatus(uint256 slotId, bytes32 ruleId)`: Checks the current boolean status of a specific rule's condition *without* triggering a state collapse.
    15. `queryPotentialWithdrawAmount(uint256 slotId)`: Estimates the amount that *might* be withdrawable if a state collapse were triggered *now* (simulation, does not update state).
    16. `setAllowedToken(address tokenAddress, bool allowed)`: (Owner only) Configures which tokens are allowed in the vault.
    17. `getAllowedTokens()`: Views the list of tokens allowed in the vault.
    18. `getTotalVaultBalance(address tokenAddress)`: Gets the total balance of a specific token across *all* slots in the vault.
    19. `getSlotBalance(uint256 slotId)`: Gets the current raw token balance held within a specific slot.
    20. `getUserSlots(address user)`: Lists all slot IDs owned by a specific user.
    21. `EmergencyWithdraw(address tokenAddress)`: (Owner only) Allows the owner to withdraw *all* of a specific token from the contract in case of emergency, bypassing all slot rules. Use with extreme caution.
    22. `updateOracleAddress(address oracleAddress)`: (Owner only) Updates the address of a trusted external oracle contract used by certain rule types.
    23. `registerDependentSlot(uint256 slotId, uint256 dependentSlotId)`: Registers another slot as a potential dependency for rules in the first slot.
    24. `unregisterDependentSlot(uint256 slotId, uint256 dependentSlotId)`: Removes a slot dependency registration.
    25. `viewSlotCollaborators(uint256 slotId)`: Views the list of collaborators for a slot.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Quantum Metaphor / State Collapse:** The core concept is the dynamic `currentStateResult` which is *not* updated in real-time with external conditions but only when `triggerStateCollapse` is called ("measurement"). This introduces a conceptual layer of "superposition" where the actual withdrawable state is uncertain until observed. It forces users to actively interact to determine the current outcome, which can be a desired mechanism for encouraging engagement or synchronizing state evaluation.
2.  **Entanglement Rules:** The variety and parameterization of rules (`EntanglementRule` struct, `RuleType` enum) are designed to create complex conditions ("entanglements"). Including rule types like `DependentSlotState` and `ExternalOraclePrice` introduces inter-contract and external data dependencies. `InteractionCount` adds a game-like element. `SignedCondition` hints at off-chain signing workflows integrated into on-chain logic.
3.  **Rule Evaluation Model:** The `_evaluateRules` and `_checkRuleCondition` functions show a pattern for combining multiple conditions. While this example uses a simple "AND" gate (all active rules must be met for full withdrawal), this structure is extensible to more complex logic (e.g., weighted rules, OR conditions, rules that release partial amounts).
4.  **Dynamic Rule Configuration:** `setEntanglementRule`, `removeEntanglementRule`, and `configureRuleParameter` allow rules to be added, changed, or removed *after* slot creation, providing flexibility. Generating `ruleId`s based on content/context makes them unique identifiers.
5.  **Collaboration and Delegation:** `addCollaborator`, `removeCollaborator`, and `delegateWithdrawal` add layers of access control beyond simple ownership, allowing complex interactions where multiple parties might be involved in managing or accessing a slot. `delegateWithdrawal` with a time limit is a specific pattern.
6.  **Querying vs. Triggering:** Differentiating between `viewRuleConditionStatus` (passive check) and `triggerStateCollapse` (active state update) reinforces the "measurement" concept. `queryPotentialWithdrawAmount` attempts to bridge this by simulating the collapse *without* state change, highlighting the potential gas costs of complex checks.
7.  **Non-Standard Functions:** Functions like `delegateWithdrawal`, `addCollaborator`, `configureRuleParameter`, `queryPotentialWithdrawAmount`, `registerDependentSlot`, and `EmergencyWithdraw` (despite its danger) push beyond typical vault operations.

**Limitations and Considerations (as with any complex concept):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Evaluating multiple complex rules (especially those involving external calls) in `triggerStateCollapse` can become expensive. The design could be optimized (e.g., lazy evaluation per rule, paying gas per rule evaluation).
*   **Oracle Dependency:** `ExternalOraclePrice` introduces reliance on a trusted third party and the availability of the oracle contract.
*   **Complexity:** Managing many slots with diverse, interdependent rules can become complex for both users and the contract itself.
*   **Mapping Iteration:** As noted in `viewSlotCollaborators` and `viewAllAllowedTokens`, iterating over mappings directly is not standard or efficient in Solidity. A production contract would need different data structures (like arrays managed alongside mappings) if these listing functions were critical. The current implementation is a placeholder.
*   **Rule Parameterization:** Using `uint256`, `address`, and `bytes` provides some flexibility for rule parameters, but defining and validating parameters for *every* potential `RuleType` is a significant design challenge not fully detailed here.
*   **Security of Rules:** The contract trusts the outcome of `_checkRuleCondition`. If a rule type has a vulnerability or unexpected behavior, it could impact vault access. Adding/removing rule *types* would require contract upgrades or a plugin architecture.

This contract serves as an example of how to combine multiple concepts (token holding, access control, conditionality, external data interaction, delegation, state management) under a creative theme to generate a unique and relatively advanced smart contract design with >20 functions.
