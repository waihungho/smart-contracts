Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a complex "Decentralized Autonomous Portfolio" (DAP). This contract aims to be advanced by integrating several concepts: managing multiple asset types (ERC20, ERC721), integrating with external "Strategy Modules", implementing a basic on-chain risk scoring mechanism, supporting conditional automated actions, and allowing for delegated management.

It's designed as a framework where specific complex logic (like swapping via Uniswap, lending via Aave, or executing sophisticated trading strategies) is delegated to approved external contracts ("Strategy Modules"), keeping the core DAP contract focused on asset management, allocation, risk, and automation triggers.

This contract is *conceptual* and simplified for demonstration. A production version would require significant security audits, more robust oracle integrations (for value and risk scoring), and more sophisticated strategy module interfaces.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address[] memory initialManagers)`: Initializes the contract, setting the deployer as owner and adding initial managers.
2.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of the contract (only owner).
3.  `addManager(address manager)`: Grants manager privileges (only owner).
4.  `removeManager(address manager)`: Revokes manager privileges (only owner).
5.  `isManager(address account)`: Checks if an address has manager privileges.
6.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens into the portfolio's custody. Requires prior approval.
7.  `withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount, address recipient)`: Allows owner/managers to withdraw ERC20 tokens held by the portfolio.
8.  `depositERC721(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows users to deposit ERC721 NFTs into the portfolio's custody. Requires prior approval.
9.  `withdrawERC721(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, address recipient)`: Allows owner/managers to withdraw specific ERC721 NFTs held by the portfolio.
10. `getERC20Balance(address token)`: Returns the balance of a specific ERC20 token held by the portfolio contract.
11. `getERC721Owner(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Checks if the portfolio contract is the owner of a specific NFT. Returns true if it is.
12. `registerStrategy(address strategyAddress, string memory name)`: Registers an external contract as an approved strategy module (only owner/managers).
13. `deregisterStrategy(address strategyAddress)`: Deregisters an approved strategy module (only owner/managers).
14. `allocateToStrategy(address strategyAddress, address token, uint256 percentageBps)`: Sets the target allocation percentage (in basis points, 10000 = 100%) of a specific ERC20 token to a registered strategy (only owner/managers). This updates the *target*, rebalancing moves the assets.
15. `deallocateFromStrategy(address strategyAddress, address token)`: Removes any allocation target for a specific token to a strategy (only owner/managers).
16. `getCurrentAllocation(address strategyAddress, address token)`: Returns the currently set target allocation percentage for a token to a strategy.
17. `executeStrategyRebalance(address strategyAddress)`: Triggers the rebalancing mechanism for a specific strategy, moving tokens according to the set allocation targets. *Interacts with the external strategy contract.*
18. `setStrategyParameters(address strategyAddress, bytes memory params)`: Allows owner/managers to call a function on an approved strategy contract to update its internal parameters using arbitrary bytes data.
19. `updateAssetRiskScore(address asset, uint256 score)`: Manually (or via trusted oracle) updates the risk score (e.g., 0-100) for a specific asset (only owner/managers).
20. `updateStrategyRiskScore(address strategyAddress, uint256 score)`: Manually (or via trusted oracle) updates the risk score for a registered strategy (only owner/managers).
21. `getPortfolioRiskScore()`: Calculates an aggregated risk score for the entire portfolio based on asset holdings, strategy allocations, and their respective risk scores. (Simplified calculation).
22. `setRiskThreshold(uint256 threshold)`: Sets the maximum acceptable aggregated portfolio risk score (only owner/managers). Exceeding this *can* trigger mitigation.
23. `triggerRiskMitigation()`: A callable function (potentially triggered by a relayer or conditional action) that executes predefined risk mitigation steps, like reducing exposure to high-risk strategies/assets if the threshold is exceeded.
24. `addConditionalAction(bytes32 actionId, ConditionalAction memory action)`: Defines an automated action that can be executed if a specific on-chain condition is met (only owner/managers).

27. `_executeStrategyAction(address strategyAddress, bytes memory data)`: Internal helper function to call a specific function on an approved strategy contract using arbitrary calldata.
28. `_calculatePortfolioValue()`: *Placeholder* - Represents logic that would interact with price oracles to estimate the total value of assets held. Returns a dummy value.
29. `_transferERC20(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Internal helper for safe ERC20 transfers.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Custody & Management:** Handles both ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs within a single contract, which is common but the integration with other features makes it more complex than a simple vault.
2.  **Modular Strategy Integration:** The contract doesn't contain the trading/yield logic itself. It delegates this to external `IPortfolioStrategy` contracts. This allows for:
    *   **Upgradeability/Flexibility:** New strategies can be developed and registered without changing the core DAP contract (as long as they adhere to the `IPortfolioStrategy` interface).
    *   **Specialization:** Different strategy contracts can specialize in specific areas (e.g., Uniswap LP, Aave lending, complex options strategies).
    *   **Risk Segregation:** While the DAP holds assets, the *logic* resides externally. A bug in *one* strategy doesn't necessarily compromise the core DAP contract or *other* strategies (though assets allocated to the buggy strategy could be at risk).
3.  **Active Rebalancing via Strategy Modules:** Instead of the DAP contract pushing assets *to* strategies with fixed instructions, the `executeStrategyRebalance` calls a generic `executeStrategy` function on the module. The module then *pulls* or *pushes* assets back to the DAP using `depositAssets`/`withdrawAssets` based on the allocation targets set in the DAP. This puts more control (and complexity) into the strategy module, potentially allowing for more sophisticated, state-aware rebalancing.
4.  **On-Chain Risk Scoring (Conceptual):** Includes mappings to store risk scores for assets and strategies and a function to calculate an aggregated portfolio score. While the calculation shown is a simplified placeholder (due to needing complex oracle data and potentially iterating over all holdings), the *structure* exists for implementing a dynamic, on-chain risk assessment.
5.  **Dynamic Risk Mitigation:** The `triggerRiskMitigation` function acts as a response mechanism to the risk score. It can be called manually or automatically via conditional actions. The *logic* within the mitigation function is a placeholder but represents automated actions like de-risking allocations.
6.  **Conditional Automation:** The `ConditionalAction` struct and associated functions allow scheduling or triggering actions based on on-chain states (time, token balance, portfolio risk). This enables automating tasks like rebalancing, withdrawing funds, or triggering risk mitigation without constant manual intervention, often relying on external relayers (`checkAndExecuteCondition` is public for this).
7.  **Delegated Management:** The `Manager` role provides an intermediate layer of access control between the sole `Owner` and public users, allowing specific trusted addresses to perform certain operational tasks (like adding strategies, setting parameters, withdrawing assets) without needing full ownership.
8.  **Simplified ERC721 Management:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `ERC721Holder` to correctly receive NFTs. While the example `getERC721Owner` is basic, the framework supports holding multiple NFTs from potentially multiple collections.

This contract provides a foundation for a decentralized fund, automated treasury management, or even a platform for yield farming strategies, incorporating elements of modularity, automation, and basic risk awareness that go beyond typical simple smart contract examples. Remember that implementing the actual logic within the `IPortfolioStrategy` contracts and integrating with real-world oracles would be significant additional development efforts.
