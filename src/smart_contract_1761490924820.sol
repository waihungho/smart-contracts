The `EchelonForgeDAO` is a pioneering Decentralized Autonomous Organization designed to cultivate a self-sustaining ecosystem built on meritocracy and continuous contribution. It introduces several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts:

*   **Dynamic Reputation (Echelon Score):** Unlike static token-based governance, members earn and lose reputation based on their active contributions (proposals, votes, reviews, task completion). Reputation also decays over time, incentivizing sustained engagement. This "Echelon Score" directly influences voting power, resource allocation priority, and is non-transferable.
*   **Adaptive Treasury Management:** The DAO's treasury can dynamically adjust its resource allocation strategies for funding proposals and bounties. This adaptation is influenced by internal performance metrics and external market conditions (simulated via oracle feeds), aiming for more sustainable and responsive financial management.
*   **EchelonBadge dNFTs:** Each member receives a unique, non-transferable "EchelonBadge" NFT. This dNFT's metadata (visual traits, levels, achievements, etc.) dynamically evolves in real-time, reflecting the holder's Echelon Score and historical contributions within the DAO. It serves as a visual representation of their status and influence.
*   **Gamified Task & Bounty System:** A structured framework allows members to propose, claim, and verify tasks, earning token rewards and Echelon Score bonuses, fostering a productive and incentivized work environment.
*   **Commit-Reveal Voting:** For critical or sensitive proposals, the DAO can employ a commit-reveal voting mechanism. This enhances voter privacy and mitigates issues like vote-buying or last-minute influence by separating the act of committing a hashed vote from revealing the actual vote.

The `EchelonForgeDAO` aims to create a highly engaged, adaptive, and meritocratic on-chain community, where influence is earned through consistent, valuable contributions.

### **EchelonForgeDAO: Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `EchelonForgeDAO`

**Core Concept:** The `EchelonForgeDAO` is a dynamic, reputation-based Decentralized Autonomous Organization that manages a shared treasury, incentivizes active participation through a unique Dynamic NFT (EchelonBadge), and adapts its resource allocation strategies based on internal performance metrics and external market conditions (via simulated oracles). Influence and rewards within the DAO are directly tied to a member's continuously evolving reputation (Echelon Score), ensuring meritocracy and sustained engagement.

---

**I. DAO Core Management & Membership (Functions 1-4)**
1.  `constructor(address _initialTreasuryAdmin)`: Initializes the DAO with its core parameters, initial treasury administrator, and the EchelonBadge NFT.
2.  `joinDAO()`: Allows a new user to join the DAO. This action mints an initial EchelonBadge NFT for the member and assigns a base Echelon Score.
3.  `leaveDAO()`: Enables a member to exit the DAO. This burns their EchelonBadge, clears their Echelon Score, and potentially manages any associated stakes.
4.  `updateDaoSettings(uint256 _newReputationDecayRate, uint256 _newMinProposalRep, uint256 _newProposalVotingPeriod)`: A governance function (callable by the treasury admin or via a passed proposal) to adjust critical DAO parameters such as reputation decay rates, minimum reputation to propose, and voting period durations.

**II. Dynamic Reputation (Echelon Score) & Interaction (Functions 5-11)**
5.  `getEffectiveReputation(address _member) public view returns (uint256)`: Public view to retrieve a member's current, decay-adjusted Echelon Score. This score determines voting power and Badge traits.
6.  `submitProposal(string memory _metadataCID, address _targetContract, bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _tokenAmountRequested, address _recipient, uint256 _requiredReputation)`: Allows a member to submit a new proposal to the DAO, earning an initial Echelon Score bonus. Proposals link to off-chain metadata (CID) and can request treasury funds or specific contract calls.
7.  `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Enables members to cast a vote on an active proposal. Voting power is weighted by the member's current Echelon Score, and participation earns a reputation bonus.
8.  `reviewProposal(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _reviewCID, uint256 _reviewRating)`: Allows members to submit a formal review for a proposal (e.g., quality, feasibility), contributing to its evaluation and earning Echelon Score.
9.  `_awardReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Internal function used by the contract to increment a member's Echelon Score.
10. `_decayReputation(address _member)`: Internal function applied when `getEffectiveReputation` or other Echelon Score-dependent functions are called, to update the member's score based on inactivity and the defined decay rate.
11. `getMemberLastActiveTime(address _member) public view returns (uint256)`: Public view to retrieve the timestamp of a member's last active contribution, crucial for reputation decay calculations.

**III. Task & Bounty System (Functions 12-15)**
12. `createTaskBounty(string memory _taskCID, address _rewardToken, uint256 _rewardAmount, uint256 _reputationBonus, uint256 _expiration)`: DAO members can propose tasks or bounties, defining a content hash (CID), token rewards, and an Echelon Score bonus for completion.
13. `claimTask(uint256 _taskId)`: A member indicates their intention to undertake a specific task, locking it for completion.
14. `submitTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId, string memory _proofCID)`: The claiming member submits cryptographic proof or a content hash (CID) demonstrating completion of the task.
15. `verifyTaskAndAward(uint256 _taskId, address _claimer)`: Governance or designated reviewers verify the submitted proof of task completion. Upon successful verification, the bounty's token rewards and Echelon Score bonus are awarded.

**IV. Adaptive Treasury Management (Functions 16-19)**
16. `depositToTreasury(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Allows external parties or members to deposit ERC20 tokens into the DAO's treasury. (Requires prior ERC20 `approve`).
17. `depositETHToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit native ETH into the DAO's treasury.
18. `executeApprovedProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has successfully passed voting. This function handles the disbursement of funds from the treasury or the execution of specified contract calls.
19. `setOracleAddress(address _token, address _oracleAddress)`: A governance function to set or update the address of a Chainlink-compatible price oracle for a specific token, enabling dynamic treasury management.
20. `refreshAdaptiveAllocation()`: Callable by anyone (e.g., a keeper or community member) to trigger a re-evaluation of treasury fund distribution strategies. This function uses oracle data and internal DAO performance metrics to suggest or implement adjustments to funding priorities for proposals and bounties.

**V. EchelonBadge dNFTs (ERC721 Extension) (Functions 21-23)**
21. `mintEchelonBadge(address _to, uint256 _initialReputation)`: Internal function called during `joinDAO` to mint a new EchelonBadge NFT for a joining member. These NFTs are non-transferable (soulbound).
22. `updateBadgeDynamicTraits(address _member)`: Public function, callable by anyone (e.g., a keeper or the member themselves), that triggers an update to the metadata/traits of a member's EchelonBadge based on their current Echelon Score and achievements. This re-generates the `tokenURI`.
23. `tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) override public view returns (string memory)`: Standard ERC721 function that returns a URI pointing to the JSON metadata for a given EchelonBadge. The metadata is dynamically generated on-chain to reflect the holder's real-time Echelon Score and achievements.

**VI. Advanced Governance: Commit-Reveal Voting (Functions 24-26)**
24. `initiateCommitRevealVote(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _commitDuration, uint256 _revealDuration)`: Initiates a commit-reveal voting process for a specific proposal, defining the duration for both the commit and reveal phases.
25. `commitVote(uint256 _proposalId, bytes32 _voteHash)`: During the commit period, members submit a cryptographic hash of their intended vote (support/against) along with a random salt.
26. `revealVote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support, uint256 _salt)`: During the reveal period, members publicly disclose their actual vote and the salt used in the commit phase, allowing verification against their committed hash.
27. `tallyCommitRevealVote(uint256 _proposalId)`: After the reveal period has concluded, this function is called to aggregate and tally the revealed votes, determining the final outcome of the proposal.
