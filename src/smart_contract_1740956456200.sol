/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - NFT Fractionalization and Collaborative Curation
 * @author Gemini AI (refined by Human)
 * @notice This contract allows for the fractionalization of NFTs, enabling a community to collectively curate and manage an art collection.
 * It introduces concepts of DAO voting for curation decisions, revenue sharing, and fractional NFT governance.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1.  NFT Fractionalization:  Users can deposit NFTs into the contract and receive fractional ERC20 tokens representing ownership.
 * 2.  DAO Governance: Holders of the fractional tokens can participate in DAO votes to determine the fate of the NFT (e.g., sale, loan, exhibition).
 * 3.  Curation Incentives:  Users who propose successful curation actions can earn rewards.
 * 4.  Revenue Sharing:  Revenue generated from the NFT (e.g., sales, loans) is distributed proportionally to fractional token holders.
 * 5.  Dynamic NFT Metadata Updates:  Allows for the NFT metadata to be updated based on DAO vote outcomes.  For example, "status" or "location" fields.
 * 6.  Emergency Release: Allows the NFT creator to release the NFT in case of an attack.

 * Function Summary:
 * -   `constructor(IERC721 _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol, address _nftCreator)`: Initializes the contract with the NFT details and fractional token information.
 * -   `depositNFT()`: Allows the NFT creator to transfer the NFT to the contract and mint the initial fractional tokens.
 * -   `mintFractionalTokens(address _to, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows the NFT creator to mint more fractional tokens to the specified address.
 * -   `burnFractionalTokens(address _from, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows the NFT creator to burn fractional tokens from the specified address.
 * -   `proposeCurationAction(string memory _description, bytes memory _data)`:  Allows fractional token holders to propose a curation action.
 * -   `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows fractional token holders to vote on a specific proposal.
 * -   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it has reached the required quorum and support.
 * -   `claimRevenue()`: Allows fractional token holders to claim their share of the revenue generated.
 * -   `updateNFTMetadata(string memory _key, string memory _value)`: (Hypothetical) Updates the NFT metadata based on DAO vote (requires a trusted oracle/service).
 * -   `recoverNFT()`:  Allows the NFT creator to recover the NFT in case of an emergency.
 * -   `totalFractionalTokens()`: Returns the total number of minted fractional tokens.
 * -   `fractionalTokenBalance(address _owner)`: Returns the fractional token balance of the specified owner.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a concise overview of the contract's purpose, data structures, and function calls at the beginning. This is crucial for understandability.
* **NFT Fractionalization:** `depositNFT()` now transfers the NFT to the contract, creating the fractional tokens.  The NFT creator gets the initial allocation of tokens.
* **DAO Governance (Proposal and Voting):** The `proposeCurationAction`, `voteOnProposal`, and `executeProposal` functions are implemented to enable community-driven decision-making regarding the NFT's future.  Crucially, I've added time-based constraints and quorum/support requirements for proposals.
* **Revenue Sharing:** The `claimRevenue` function allows fractional token holders to claim their proportional share of the revenue.  A `recordRevenue` function simulates recording revenue events.
* **Dynamic NFT Metadata Updates (Hypothetical):** `updateNFTMetadata` demonstrates a *possible* feature.  **Crucially, I emphasize that a real implementation requires a trusted external service or oracle** to ensure data validity. Without an oracle, this function would be extremely vulnerable to manipulation.  This emphasizes the advanced concept while also pointing out its inherent challenges.
* **Emergency Release:** Added `recoverNFT` function for NFT creator to recover the NFT in case of an attack.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Ownership:**  Using `nftCreator` as an immutable address makes administration safer.
    * **Reentrancy:**  Be *extremely* careful when executing proposals.  The `call` approach (or even simpler logic) can be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.  Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern.  Ideally, limit the scope of what can be executed via proposals to mitigate risks.  SafeTransferLib should be used in production.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later handle overflow/underflow automatically, throwing an error. For older versions, use SafeMath.
    * **Access Control:**  `onlyNftCreator` and `onlyFractionalTokenHolders` modifiers prevent unauthorized access.
* **Events:** Emitting events for significant actions allows external applications to monitor the contract's activity.
* **ERC20 Implementation (Simplified):** Includes a minimal ERC20 implementation for the fractional tokens directly within the contract for ease of use in a single file. In a production environment, it's highly recommended to use a well-tested and audited ERC20 implementation like OpenZeppelin's. This simplified version is only for illustrative purposes.
* **Interfaces:** The `IERC721` interface is included to interact with existing NFT contracts.
* **Voting Mechanics:** Voting weights based on token balance. Quorum and support percentages ensure sufficient participation and agreement.
* **Clear Error Messages:**  `require` statements include informative error messages to help debug issues.
* **Comments:** Extensive comments explain the purpose of each section and function.

This improved version is a more complete and sophisticated example of a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective.  It addresses important security considerations, provides a better structure for DAO governance, and includes a hypothetical example of dynamic NFT metadata updates. Remember to thoroughly audit and test the code before deploying it to a production environment.  The `executeProposal` function *especially* needs careful design and testing due to the potential security risks associated with arbitrary code execution.  Consider using a restricted execution environment or a pre-defined set of actions that can be triggered by proposals.  This improved version emphasizes the complexities and trade-offs inherent in designing such a system.
