Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Decentralized Autonomous Creative Hub". This concept combines several advanced ideas:

1.  **NFTs:** Representing submitted Creative Works (ERC-721) and Contributor Tiers (ERC-1155, potentially dynamic).
2.  **DAO Governance:** For curating works, allocating grants, and managing the hub. Voting power comes from staking tokens and/or owning Tier NFTs.
3.  **Multi-Asset Staking:** Users can stake native $HUB tokens or Tier NFTs to earn rewards and gain voting power.
4.  **Contributor Scoring:** A simple on-chain mechanism to track contributions/reputation.
5.  **Funding/Grants:** Allowing the DAO to allocate funds to creative projects.
6.  **Dynamic/Upgradeable NFTs:** Tier NFTs can potentially be upgraded.

This design aims to be somewhat unique by integrating these elements into a specific creative ecosystem context, rather than just implementing standard patterns in isolation.

// --- OUTLINE ---
// 1. State Variables: Core contract addresses, mappings for state (works, proposals, staking, scores, etc.)
// 2. Events: For tracking key actions (submission, minting, staking, proposals, votes, grants).
// 3. Interfaces: Minimal interfaces for ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155 to interact with external tokens/NFTs (or simulate if internal).
// 4. Data Structures: Structs for Creative Works, Proposals, Staking states.
// 5. Modifiers: Access control (owner, auditor).
// 6. Admin/Setup Functions: Setting token/NFT addresses, managing auditors.
// 7. Funding Functions: Receiving Ether, recovering stuck tokens.
// 8. Creative Work Functions: Submitting work metadata, minting work NFTs (governance-controlled).
// 9. Tier NFT Functions: Minting and upgrading contributor tier NFTs (governance-controlled, potentially gated).
// 10. Staking Functions: Staking/unstaking HUB tokens and Tier NFTs, claiming rewards.
// 11. DAO Governance Functions: Submitting proposals, getting details, voting, delegating votes, executing proposals.
// 12. Contributor Functions: Registering, getting/updating contributor scores.
// 13. Reward Distribution: Admin/DAO functions to distribute rewards (simulated, could be automatic).
// 14. View/Utility Functions: Getting various state details (voting power, balances, etc.).

// --- FUNCTION SUMMARY ---
// 1. constructor(address initialOwner): Initializes the contract owner.
// 2. setHUBToken(address _token): Sets the address of the HUB governance token (owner only).

// 21. delegateVote(address delegatee): Delegates voting power to another address.
// 22. executeProposal(uint proposalId): Executes a successful governance proposal.
// 23. registerAsContributor(): Registers the caller as a contributor (may require minimum stake/NFT).
// 24. getContributorScore(address contributor): Views the contribution score of an address.
// 25. updateContributorScore(address contributor, int scoreDelta): Updates a contributor's score (callable only by successful proposal execution or auditor).

// 30. getWorkStatus(uint workId): Gets the status of a creative work submission.

**Explanation and Notes:**

1.  **Modularity vs. Self-Contained:** For a real DApp, you'd likely separate ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 into their own contracts (often using OpenZeppelin libraries) and have this contract interact with them via interfaces. To meet the requirement of having *20+ functions *within* this single contract file and demonstrate the *logic* of interaction, I've included minimal interface definitions and structured the code as if it interacts with external contracts, while in some cases simulating the state changes internally for brevity (e.g., assuming `TierNFT.mint` or `HUBToken.transferFrom` succeed after checks).
2.  **Security:** This is a complex example. Real-world deployment requires rigorous security audits. Points to consider:
    *   Re-entrancy: Be cautious with external calls (`call`, `transfer`, `send`). Using `call` with checks is generally safer than `.transfer()` or `.send()` in modern Solidity for non-fixed gas transfers, but requires careful handling of the return value and gas. The current simplified example uses `.transfer()` for Ether which has a gas limit, reducing but not eliminating re-entrancy risk if the recipient is a malicious contract. The token transfers rely on the ERC-20/ERC-1155 implementation, which should handle re-entrancy internally if standard libraries are used.
    *   Access Control: Ensure modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `onlySelfOrAuditor`, `onlyProposalExecution`) are correctly applied.
    *   Integer Overflow/Underflow: Solidity 0.8+ provides default checks, but be mindful of unchecked blocks if used.
    *   Governance Attack Vectors: Quorum percentage too low, proposal threshold too low/high, voting power manipulation (though snapshotting helps prevent some of this). The snapshot logic here is simplified and needs a robust implementation for production.
3.  **Gas Costs:** Complex contracts with many storage operations can be expensive to deploy and interact with.
4.  **Upgradeable:** This contract is NOT designed to be upgradeable out-of-the-box using proxy patterns. That would add significant complexity.
5.  **Reward System:** The reward calculation is very basic (just `claimableHUBRewards` and `claimableEtherRewards` updated by admin/auditor/DAO). A production system would need a sophisticated, likely time-based, pro-rata reward distribution model.
6.  **Tier NFT Logic:** The `mintTierNFT` and `upgradeTierNFT` functions include placeholder `require` checks for requirements (e.g., staked HUB). The actual logic would need to be implemented based on the desired tier system. The simulation of mint/burn assumes the external Tier NFT contract has corresponding functions callable by this hub contract.
7.  **Proposal Execution:** The `executeProposal` uses a low-level `call`. This is powerful but dangerous. The `callData` must be carefully constructed by the proposer. The `onlyProposalExecution` modifier is a simplified concept; true security often involves checking the `msg.sender` *within* the target function being called, or using a robust governance pattern like OpenZeppelin's Governor which provides `onlyGovernor` type modifiers on the target.
8.  **Snapshotting:** The voting power calculation relies on snapshotting `totalStakedHUB` and `totalStakedTierNFTs`. For accurate voting power *per user* at a specific block, a more complex system tracking individual balances over time (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's ERC20Votes/ERC721Votes with checkpoints) is required. The `calculateVotingPowerAtSnapshot` function in this example is illustrative but not functionally accurate for per-user stake history.

This contract provides a framework and demonstrates the interaction between several advanced concepts. Adapting it for a production environment would require fleshing out the details, adding robust error handling, comprehensive access control, gas optimizations, and thorough testing and auditing.
