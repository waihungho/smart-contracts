Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract exploring a concept I'll call "Quantum Fluctuations". It's designed around a dynamic, internally calculated state that changes based on time and block data, allowing users to predict future states and earn rewards if they are correct. It combines elements of prediction markets, time-based mechanics, and on-chain state dynamics, aiming for novelty beyond standard token or DeFi protocols.

It uses concepts like:
*   **Dynamic On-Chain State:** The contract's core "state" changes based on deterministic calculations using block data, not external oracles.
*   **Time/Block Based Mechanics:** Actions like state updates and prediction resolution are tied to block numbers and timestamps.
*   **Prediction Market (Simplified):** Users stake Ether to predict a future state.
*   **Internal Reward Pool:** Losing stakes fund the winnings of correct predictors.
*   **Reputation System (Basic):** Tracks win/loss ratio.
*   **Permissionless State Updates:** Anyone can trigger the state transition logic, incentivizing participation.
*   **Historical State Calculation:** Ability to determine what the state *was* at a past block (within `blockhash` limitations).

## QuantumFluctuations Contract Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFluctuations`

**Concept:** A smart contract where users predict a future "quantum state" determined by internal, time/block-dependent deterministic logic. Correct predictions win a share of stakes from incorrect predictions.

**Core States:** The contract has a set of discrete, defined `QuantumState` enums.

**State Dynamics:**
*   The `activeState` changes when the `updateState` function is called.
*   The new state is calculated deterministically based on the current `block.timestamp` and `blockhash` of the previous block, combined with the time elapsed since the last update.
*   This calculation is designed to be unpredictable *before* the block is mined but verifiable *after*.
*   State transitions only occur if a minimum time interval has passed since the last update, preventing manipulation by rapid calls.

**Prediction Mechanism:**
*   Users commit a stake (in Ether) to predict which `QuantumState` the contract's internal state *will be* at a specified future `resolutionBlockNumber`.
*   Commitments are stored and immutable until the resolution block is reached.

**Resolution Mechanism:**
*   At or after the `resolutionBlockNumber`, anyone can call `resolvePredictionsForBlock` for that block.
*   The function calculates the *actual* state for that resolution block deterministically using the `block.timestamp` and `blockhash` of the resolution block itself.
*   It identifies winning and losing predictions for that block.
*   Losing stakes are collected into a reward pool for that specific resolution block.
*   Winning stakes are returned, and winners share the reward pool proportional to their stake size for that block.
*   Winnings are not paid out immediately but accumulated for later withdrawal via `withdrawWinnings`.

**Function Summary:**

1.  **`constructor(uint256 _stateTransitionInterval, uint256 _predictionWindowBlocks, uint256 _minCommitmentAmount)`**: Initializes contract parameters.
2.  **`commitPrediction(QuantumState predictedState, uint256 resolutionBlockNumber)` (payable)**: Allows a user to commit Ether to a prediction for a future block.
3.  **`resolvePredictionsForBlock(uint256 blockNumber)`**: Triggers the resolution process for all predictions targeting a specific past block. Calculates the actual state and determines winners/losers.
4.  **`withdrawWinnings()`**: Allows users to claim their accumulated winnings from successfully resolved predictions.
5.  **`updateState()`**: Triggers the internal state transition logic if the minimum interval has passed. Updates the `activeState`.
6.  **`getActiveState()` (view)**: Returns the contract's current `activeState`.
7.  **`getHistoricalState(uint256 pastBlockNumber)` (view)**: Calculates and returns the state the contract's logic would have determined at a specific past block number (limited to `blockhash` availability).
8.  **`getCommitment(uint256 commitmentId)` (view)**: Retrieves details for a specific prediction commitment.
9.  **`getPlayerCommitmentIds(address player)` (view)**: Returns an array of commitment IDs made by a specific player.
10. **`getTotalPendingCommitments()` (view)**: Returns the total number of active, unresolved prediction commitments.
11. **`getTotalResolvedCommitments()` (view)**: Returns the total number of prediction commitments that have been resolved.
12. **`getTotalStakedEther()` (view)**: Returns the total amount of Ether currently locked in pending commitments.
13. **`getRewardPoolBalance()` (view)**: Returns the total amount of Ether in the general reward pool (accumulated from historical losses, available for withdrawal).
14. **`calculatePotentialReward(uint256 commitmentId)` (view)**: Estimates the potential winning payout for a specific *resolved winning* commitment (based on the block's reward pool and total winning stakes for that block).
15. **`getPlayerReputation(address player)` (view)**: Returns the win/loss counts for a player.
16. **`getResolutionStatusForBlock(uint256 blockNumber)` (view)**: Checks if predictions for a specific block have been resolved.
17. **`getCommitmentIdsByResolutionBlock(uint256 blockNumber)` (view)**: Returns an array of commitment IDs targeting a specific resolution block.
18. **`getLastStateChangeInfo()` (view)**: Returns the block number and timestamp of the last state update.
19. **`getPredictionWindow()` (view)**: Returns the maximum number of blocks into the future a prediction can be made.
20. **`getMinCommitmentAmount()` (view)**: Returns the minimum Ether amount required for a prediction commitment.
21. **`getContractBalance()` (view)**: Returns the total Ether held by the contract.
22. **`cancelPendingCommitment(uint256 commitmentId)`**: Allows a user to cancel their *pending* prediction commitment before the resolution block is reached (may incur a penalty).
23. **`batchResolvePredictions(uint256[] calldata blockNumbers)`**: Allows resolving predictions for multiple blocks in a single transaction (gas intensive).
24. **`getResolvedBlockState(uint256 blockNumber)` (view)**: Returns the actual `QuantumState` determined during resolution for a past block.
25. **`getPlayerWinnings(address player)` (view)**: Returns the total unclaimed winning balance for a player.
26. **`simulateStateTransition(uint256 timestamp, bytes32 blockHash)` (pure)**: A helper function to show the state calculation logic result for given inputs, without changing contract state. Useful for external tools.
