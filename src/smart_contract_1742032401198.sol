 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Dynamic Governance and Reputation System
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a DAO with advanced features including dynamic governance,
 *      a reputation system, modular proposal types, and emergency mechanisms. It aims to be
 *      creative and trendy by incorporating aspects of adaptable governance and member reputation.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I. Core DAO Structure & Governance:**
 *    1. `constructor(string _name, string _description)`: Initializes the DAO with a name and description.
 *    2. `getName()`: Returns the name of the DAO.
 *    3. `getDescription()`: Returns the description of the DAO.
 *    4. `isMember(address _member)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAO.
 *    5. `addMember(address _member)`: Adds a new member to the DAO (governed by proposal).
 *    6. `removeMember(address _member)`: Removes a member from the DAO (governed by proposal).
 *    7. `getMembers()`: Returns a list of all DAO members.
 *    8. `getProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of proposals created.
 *    9. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal.
 *    10. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns detailed information about a proposal.
 *
 * **II. Dynamic Governance Parameters:**
 *    11. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Sets a new voting period for proposals (governed by proposal).
 *    12. `getVotingPeriod()`: Returns the current voting period.
 *    13. `setQuorumThreshold(uint256 _newQuorumThreshold)`: Sets a new quorum threshold for proposals (governed by proposal).
 *    14. `getQuorumThreshold()`: Returns the current quorum threshold.
 *    15. `setApprovalThreshold(uint256 _newApprovalThreshold)`: Sets a new approval threshold for proposals (governed by proposal).
 *    16. `getApprovalThreshold()`: Returns the current approval threshold.
 *
 * **III. Proposal Management & Voting:**
 *    17. `propose(string memory _title, string memory _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes memory _data)`: Creates a new proposal.
 *    18. `vote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _voteOption)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal.
 *    19. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved proposal.
 *    20. `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer to cancel a proposal before voting starts.
 *
 * **IV. Reputation System:**
 *    21. `getReputation(address _member)`: Returns the reputation score of a member.
 *    22. `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Increases a member's reputation score (governed by proposal).
 *    23. `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Decreases a member's reputation score (governed by proposal).
 *    24. `setReputationWeight(uint256 _newWeight)`: Sets the weight of reputation in voting (governed by proposal).
 *    25. `getReputationWeight()`: Returns the current reputation weight in voting.
 *
 * **V. Emergency & Security Mechanisms:**
 *    26. `emergencyPause()`: Pauses the DAO contract, halting critical functions (only guardian role).
 *    27. `emergencyUnpause()`: Unpauses the DAO contract (only guardian role).
 *    28. `setGuardian(address _newGuardian)`: Sets a new guardian address (governed by proposal).
 *    29. `getGuardian()`: Returns the current guardian address.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Implemented:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Structure:**
    *   Basic DAO structure with members, proposals, and voting.
    *   `members` mapping and `memberList` for member management and iteration.
    *   `proposals` mapping to store proposal details.

2.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:**
    *   **Voting Period, Quorum Threshold, Approval Threshold:** These key governance parameters are made dynamically adjustable through proposals. This allows the DAO to adapt its rules based on community consensus, which is more advanced than static governance models.
    *   `setVotingPeriod`, `setQuorumThreshold`, `setApprovalThreshold`: Functions to change these parameters, requiring successful proposals for execution.

3.  **Proposal Management with Different Types:**
    *   `ProposalType` enum: Defines different types of proposals (General, ParameterChange, MemberManagement, ReputationUpdate, Custom). This adds structure and allows for different handling logic for various proposal categories.
    *   `propose` function: Allows members to create proposals with a title, description, `ProposalType`, and `data` field.
    *   `data` field in `Proposal` struct: A `bytes` field to store proposal-specific data. This is crucial for making proposals versatile. For example, for a `ParameterChange` proposal, `data` could encode the new parameter value. For `MemberManagement`, it could encode the address to add or remove.

4.  **Voting System with Reputation Influence:**
    *   `vote` function: Members can vote `For`, `Against`, or `Abstain`.
    *   **Reputation System Integration:** Voting power is influenced by the member's reputation score (`reputationScores`) and `reputationWeight`.  Members with higher reputation have more voting power. This is a trendy and advanced concept, incentivizing positive contributions and long-term engagement.
    *   `getReputation`, `increaseReputation`, `decreaseReputation`, `setReputationWeight`: Functions for managing the reputation system, all governed by proposals to maintain decentralization.

5.  **Proposal Lifecycle Management:**
    *   `ProposalState` enum: Tracks the state of a proposal (`Pending`, `Active`, `Cancelled`, `Defeated`, `Succeeded`, `Executed`).
    *   `startProposalVoting` (internal):  Starts the voting period for a proposal (in a more complete implementation, this would be triggered after a proposal is created and meets certain requirements, perhaps through another proposal or a time delay).  In this simplified example, `startProposalVoting` is not directly called externally to keep it concise, but in a real DAO, you'd need a mechanism to move proposals from `Pending` to `Active`.
    *   `checkProposalOutcome` (internal): Automatically checks if a proposal has reached quorum and approval thresholds after each vote and at the end of the voting period, updating the `ProposalState`.
    *   `executeProposal`: Executes a successful proposal. **Crucially, the execution logic is highly dependent on the `ProposalType` and the `data` field.**  The example code provides basic (and insecure for production) examples of how to decode and execute different proposal types. In a real application, you would need robust ABI encoding and decoding and secure execution logic.
    *   `cancelProposal`: Allows the proposer to cancel a proposal before voting starts.

6.  **Emergency and Security Mechanisms:**
    *   **Guardian Role:** An `guardian` address is designated for emergency actions.
    *   `emergencyPause` and `emergencyUnpause`:  The guardian can pause the contract to halt critical functions in case of an emergency or vulnerability detection. This is a security best practice for decentralized systems.
    *   `setGuardian`: Allows changing the guardian address through a governance proposal, ensuring that even emergency control is ultimately DAO-governed.

7.  **Modularity and Extensibility (Through `ProposalType` and `data`):**
    *   The `ProposalType` enum and the `data` field in the `Proposal` struct are designed to make the DAO more modular and extensible.  New proposal types and functionalities can be added by:
        *   Extending the `ProposalType` enum.
        *   Defining how the `data` field should be structured for the new proposal type.
        *   Adding logic within the `executeProposal` function to handle the new proposal type and decode/execute the `data`.
        *   Potentially creating new dedicated functions that are called during `executeProposal` based on the `ProposalType`.

8.  **Events:**
    *   Extensive use of events (`MemberAdded`, `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `GovernanceParameterChanged`, etc.) for logging important DAO actions, making it easier to track governance processes and integrate with off-chain systems.

**Important Notes and Security Considerations (For Real-World Implementation):**

*   **Security Audits are Essential:**  This is a complex contract, and a real-world DAO contract would require thorough security audits by professional auditors before deployment.
*   **Data Encoding and Decoding in `executeProposal`:** The example code uses very basic and insecure methods for data encoding and decoding in `executeProposal`. **In a production contract, you MUST use proper ABI encoding and decoding (e.g., `abi.encode()` and `abi.decode()`) and robust function selector mechanisms to securely handle proposal data and execution.**  Avoid manual byte manipulation like shown in the insecure examples.
*   **Reentrancy Prevention:**  If your `executeProposal` function interacts with external contracts or transfers funds, you must implement reentrancy prevention mechanisms to protect against reentrancy attacks.
*   **Gas Optimization:** For a production DAO, gas optimization would be crucial. Techniques like using assembly for certain operations, optimizing data storage, and careful loop design should be considered.
*   **Access Control and Permissions:**  Review all access control (`onlyMember`, `onlyGuardian`) and ensure they are appropriate for your DAO's governance model.
*   **Upgradability:**  Consider if you need upgradability for your DAO contract. If so, you'll need to implement an upgrade pattern (e.g., proxy contracts) carefully.
*   **Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to thoroughly test all functions and scenarios of your DAO contract before deployment.
*   **Community Input:**  Involve your community in the design and review process of your DAO contract to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

This contract provides a solid foundation with advanced concepts. Remember to prioritize security, thorough testing, and proper implementation of data handling and execution logic for a real-world DAO.
