This smart contract, `ElysiumPrimeDAO`, embodies an advanced, creative, and trending concept: a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that dynamically manages a treasury, investing in DeFi protocols via community-approved, NFT-based "Investment Strategies." It integrates a reputation system that influences governance power and performance-based profit sharing for strategists.

**Key Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **NFT-based Investment Strategies:** Investment strategies are tokenized as unique NFTs (`StrategyNFT`). Their parameters are referenced via metadata URIs, and their activation/deactivation is governed by the DAO.
2.  **Dynamic Strategy Execution:** The DAO can programmatically activate and deactivate these NFT-bound strategies, allocating and rebalancing treasury funds across various simulated DeFi protocols.
3.  **Soulbound-like Reputation System:** A non-transferable reputation score accrues to users based on productive on-chain contributions (e.g., successful proposals, profitable strategy submissions, active voting). This reputation directly influences voting power and may unlock future reward tiers.
4.  **Performance-based Strategist Rewards:** Strategists whose activated NFTs yield positive returns receive a proportional share of the profits, incentivizing high-quality, profitable contributions.
5.  **Multi-stage Governance:** Proposals require reputation to create, reputation-weighted voting, and a quorum for execution, providing a robust decentralized decision-making framework.
6.  **Generic Treasury Operations:** The DAO can execute arbitrary calls on other contracts (e.g., DeFi protocols) via passed proposals, making it highly flexible and adaptable to new opportunities.

## **Contract Outline**

**I. Core DAO Management & Treasury**
    - Manages the DAO's treasury funds (held by the contract itself).
    - Functions for depositing and withdrawing funds.
    - Mechanisms for emergency pausing/resuming operations.

**II. Strategy NFT & Lifecycle**
    - Facilitates the minting of conceptual "Strategy NFTs."
    - Allows strategists to propose their NFTs for DAO approval.
    - Manages the activation and deactivation of approved strategies, including simulated investment/divestment.
    - Tracks strategy performance and distributes profits.

**III. Reputation System**
    - Tracks and updates reputation scores for DAO participants based on their contributions.
    - Provides a mechanism for reputation delegation (conceptual, for future advanced voting).

**IV. Governance & Proposal System**
    - Enables creation of proposals (requiring minimum reputation).
    - Allows reputation-weighted voting on proposals.
    - Executes proposals that meet quorum and majority approval.
    - Allows DAO to adjust governance parameters (e.g., voting period, quorum).

**V. Financial Mechanics & Profit Distribution**
    - Internal logic for calculating and distributing profits from successful strategies between strategists and the DAO treasury.
    - Allows strategists to claim their accumulated rewards.

## **Function Summary**

### **I. Core DAO Management & Treasury**

1.  **`constructor(address _strategyNFTAddress)`**
    *   Initializes the DAO, sets up roles (Ownable), links to the external `StrategyNFT` contract, and sets default parameters like minimum deposit, voting periods, and profit sharing.

2.  **`depositFunds(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount)`**
    *   Allows users to deposit specified ERC20 tokens into the DAO's treasury (this contract).
    *   Requires the deposited amount to meet a minimum threshold.
    *   Increases the depositor's reputation slightly.

3.  **`withdrawDAOProfits(IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount)`**
    *   Allows an authorized entity (typically via a successful governance proposal) to withdraw funds from the DAO treasury.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

4.  **`setMinimumDepositAmount(uint256 _newAmount)`**
    *   Sets a new minimum amount for future deposits.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

5.  **`executeTreasuryOperation(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _callData)`**
    *   A powerful function allowing the DAO to execute arbitrary function calls on any target contract using treasury funds.
    *   This enables dynamic investment, interacting with various DeFi protocols, and other complex operations.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

6.  **`emergencyPauseOperations()`**
    *   Allows the contract owner (or a designated emergency committee in a more advanced setup) to pause all critical DAO operations (deposits, strategy activations, proposal creation/voting).

7.  **`emergencyResumeOperations()`**
    *   Allows the contract owner to resume paused operations.

### **II. Strategy NFT & Lifecycle**

8.  **`mintStrategyNFT(string memory _metadataURI, address _targetProtocol)`**
    *   Allows any user to mint a new `StrategyNFT`.
    *   This NFT represents their conceptual investment strategy, with `_metadataURI` pointing to off-chain details.
    *   Assigns an initial reputation bonus to the creator.

9.  **`updateStrategyNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _newMetadataURI)`**
    *   Allows the owner of a `StrategyNFT` to update its associated metadata URI.

10. **`proposeStrategyForApproval(uint256 _strategyId)`**
    *   Allows a `StrategyNFT` owner to submit their strategy to the DAO for approval.
    *   This function automatically creates a governance proposal to `activateStrategy`.

11. **`activateStrategy(uint256 _strategyId, address _investmentToken, uint256 _amountToInvest)`**
    *   Activates an approved investment strategy, deploying a specified amount of funds in a specific token from the DAO treasury to the strategy's `targetProtocol`.
    *   Sets the strategy as `isActive` and records the investment details.
    *   Rewards the strategist with a significant reputation bonus for successful activation.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

12. **`deactivateStrategy(uint256 _strategyId)`**
    *   Deactivates an active investment strategy, simulating the divestment of funds from the `targetProtocol` back to the DAO treasury.
    *   Calculates the net profit generated and triggers profit distribution.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

13. **`getStrategyPerformanceReport(uint256 _strategyId)`**
    *   Provides a summary of a strategy's performance, including net profit, invested amount, and active status.

### **III. Reputation System**

14. **`_updateReputationScore(address _user, uint256 _amount)`** (Internal)
    *   An internal helper function to atomically add reputation points to a user's score and update the total reputation supply.
    *   Emits a `ReputationUpdated` event.

15. **`getReputationScore(address _user)`**
    *   Retrieves the current reputation score of a specified user.

16. **`delegateReputationVote(address _delegate)`**
    *   Allows a user to conceptually delegate their reputation-based voting power to another address.
    *   **Note:** The actual voting mechanism in `voteOnProposal` would need to be enhanced to fully utilize this delegation.

17. **`redeemReputationReward()`**
    *   A placeholder function for future implementation of reputation-tier-based rewards, beyond strategist profits.

### **IV. Governance & Proposal System**

18. **`createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _callData, address _targetContract)`**
    *   Allows users with sufficient reputation to create a new governance proposal.
    *   A proposal defines a `_targetContract` and `_callData` to be executed if it passes.

19. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**
    *   Allows DAO members to cast their vote (yes/no) on an active proposal.
    *   Voting power is directly proportional to their current reputation score.
    *   Rewards voters with a small reputation bonus.

20. **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**
    *   Can be called by anyone after a proposal's voting period has ended.
    *   Checks if the proposal met the required quorum and passed by a majority of 'yes' votes based on reputation.
    *   If successful, executes the proposal's defined `_callData` on the `_targetContract`.

21. **`setVotingQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`**
    *   Allows the DAO (via a successful proposal) to adjust the minimum percentage of total reputation votes required for a proposal to be considered valid.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

22. **`setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`**
    *   Allows the DAO (via a successful proposal) to adjust the duration (in seconds) for which proposals remain open for voting.
    *   **Note:** Designed to be called as a result of an `executeProposal`.

### **V. Financial Mechanics & Profit Distribution**

23. **`_distributeStrategyProfits(uint256 _strategyId, uint256 _netProfit)`** (Internal)
    *   Calculates and allocates the net profit generated by a strategy.
    *   Distributes a configured percentage to the strategist (added to their claimable balance) and the remainder to the DAO treasury.
    *   Awards the strategist additional reputation based on the profit generated.

24. **`claimStrategistReward(IERC20 _token)`**
    *   Allows strategists to claim their accumulated profit shares from successful strategies in the specified ERC20 token.

### **VI. Auxiliary Functions**

25. **`getNumActiveStrategies()`**
    *   Returns the current count of investment strategies actively deploying DAO funds.

26. **`getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`**
    *   Retrieves all details of a specific governance proposal.
