/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Knowledge Repository (DAKR)
 * @author Bard (Your AI assistant)
 * @notice This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Knowledge Repository (DAKR) that incentivizes users to contribute, review, and curate knowledge in a specific domain.
 *         It introduces a reputation-based system where contributors earn reputation tokens for providing valuable knowledge.
 *         Reviewers earn tokens for accurately assessing the quality and relevance of the contributions.
 *         A decentralized curation mechanism allows the community to manage the repository and ensure the quality of the content.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 *  - **Knowledge Submission:**  Users can submit new knowledge entries, including detailed information, references, and suggested keywords.
 *  - **Reputation-Based Incentive:** Contributors earn reputation tokens proportional to the perceived value of their submissions, as determined by the review process.
 *  - **Review Mechanism:** Reviewers assess the quality, relevance, and accuracy of submitted knowledge entries.  Their reviews are weighted based on their own reputation.
 *  - **Decentralized Curation:** A governance mechanism based on staked tokens allows the community to propose and vote on changes to the repository, such as blacklisting malicious actors or modifying the reward distribution.
 *  - **Keyword Indexing:**  Knowledge entries are indexed using keywords, facilitating efficient search and retrieval.
 *  - **Content Dispute Resolution:** A mechanism to resolve disputes regarding content accuracy or plagiarism.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts:**
 *  - **Reputation Decay:** Reputation decays over time if the user doesn't actively participate in the system (to maintain a high-quality, actively-engaged community).
 *  - **Quadratic Funding for Bounty Creation:** Users can create bounties for specific knowledge gaps, and the funding is matched using a quadratic funding mechanism (promoting diverse and public-good knowledge).
 *  - **Automated Content Summary using AI (Simulated Here):** While integrating a real AI model on-chain is not feasible, the contract includes a placeholder and functions to simulate AI-generated content summaries for each knowledge entry.  In a future (off-chain) system, these summaries could be generated externally and then stored on-chain through a trusted oracle.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  The contract is heavily documented, explaining each function, variable, and concept in detail.  This is crucial for understanding and maintaining the code.  It also adheres to the NatSpec format, so you can generate API documentation.
* **Reputation Decay:** Implemented a simple reputation decay function that reduces user reputations periodically if they don't participate. This is a valuable addition to keep reputations relevant.  The decay period is configurable.  I also added `setReputationDecayRate()` function.
* **Quadratic Funding Simulation:** Included a placeholder and a simplified calculation to demonstrate quadratic funding.  The comments clearly explain that a real implementation requires an off-chain system and a more complex matching mechanism.
* **Simulated AI Summary:** Added a `simulateAISummary` function that provides a placeholder for AI-generated content summaries.  The comments explain how this could be integrated with an off-chain AI service using an oracle.
* **Clear Governance Mechanism:**  The contract includes a basic governance mechanism with proposals, voting, and execution.  The comments explain the limitations and potential extensions.  Added `mintGovernanceTokens()` for the owner.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors.  Modifier `onlyActiveEntry` make it easier to read the code.
* **Events:** Emits events to track key actions performed on the contract, making it easier to monitor and analyze its activity.
* **Security Considerations:** Uses modifiers to restrict access to sensitive functions.  More comprehensive security audits are needed before deployment.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The code is written to be relatively gas-efficient, but further optimizations are possible.  For example, using `calldata` instead of `memory` for input parameters can save gas.
* **Extensibility:** The contract is designed to be extensible, allowing for future features to be added without breaking existing functionality.
* **Governance tokens:**  Added governance tokens for participating in proposals.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy it to a test network** (like Ganache, Goerli, or Sepolia).
2.  **Interact with the functions** using a tool like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
3.  **Test thoroughly** to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.
4.  **Consider a security audit** before deploying to a production environment.

This contract provides a solid foundation for building a decentralized knowledge repository with advanced features and incentives. Remember that the AI and quadratic funding aspects are simulated and require external integration for real-world implementation.
