/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Collaborative Art (DAOArt)
 * @author Gemini AI (Hypothetical Smart Contract Example)
 * @notice This smart contract implements a DAO focused on collaborative art creation, management, and ownership.
 * It features advanced concepts like dynamic voting, fractional NFT ownership, reputation-based access, and collaborative project funding.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * ----------------
 * **Membership & Roles:**
 * 1. requestMembership(): Allows users to request membership in the DAO.
 * 2. approveMembership(address _user): Allows DAO admins to approve membership requests.
 * 3. revokeMembership(address _user): Allows DAO admins to revoke membership.
 * 4. getMemberDetails(address _user): Retrieves details about a DAO member (membership status, reputation).
 * 5. assignAdminRole(address _user): Assigns admin role to a member, granting elevated privileges.
 * 6. removeAdminRole(address _user): Removes admin role from a member.
 * 7. isAdmin(address _user): Checks if an address has admin role.
 *
 * **Reputation System:**
 * 8. contributeToReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount):  Allows admins to reward members with reputation points for contributions.
 * 9. deductFromReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount): Allows admins to deduct reputation points from members (e.g., for misconduct).
 * 10. getReputation(address _user): Retrieves the reputation score of a member.
 *
 * **Art Project Proposals & Funding:**
 * 11. proposeArtProject(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectDescription, uint256 _fundingGoal): Allows members to propose new art projects to the DAO.
 * 12. voteOnProjectProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Allows members to vote on project proposals.
 * 13. getProjectProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific art project proposal.
 * 14. fundProject(uint256 _projectId): Allows members to contribute funds to a approved art project.
 * 15. withdrawProjectFunds(uint256 _projectId): Allows project creators to withdraw funds from a successfully funded project (governed by milestones/voting - simplified here).
 * 16. markProjectMilestoneComplete(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId): Allows project creators to mark milestones as complete (can trigger further actions like fund release).
 *
 * **Fractional NFT for Collaborative Art:**
 * 17. mintFractionalNFT(uint256 _projectId, string memory _nftName, string memory _nftSymbol, string memory _nftURI): Mints a fractional NFT representing ownership of a collaborative art piece created through a project.
 * 18. getNFTContractAddress(uint256 _projectId): Retrieves the address of the fractional NFT contract associated with a project.
 * 19. transferNFTFraction(uint256 _projectId, address _recipient, uint256 _amount): Allows fractional NFT holders to transfer their shares.
 *
 * **DAO Treasury Management:**
 * 20. depositToTreasury(): Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
 * 21. withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount): Allows DAO admins to withdraw funds from the treasury (for DAO operations, project funding etc.).
 * 22. getTreasuryBalance(): Retrieves the current balance of the DAO treasury.
 *
 * **Events:**
 * - MembershipRequested
 * - MembershipApproved
 * - MembershipRevoked
 * - AdminRoleAssigned
 * - AdminRoleRemoved
 * - ReputationContributed
 * - ReputationDeducted
 * - ArtProjectProposed
 * - ProjectProposalVoted
 * - ProjectFunded
 * - ProjectFundsWithdrawn
 * - ProjectMilestoneCompleted
 * - FractionalNFTMinted
 * - TreasuryDeposit
 * - TreasuryWithdrawal
