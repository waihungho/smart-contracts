Okay, here's a Solidity smart contract implementing a concept I'm calling "Dynamic Reputation-Based Governance with Liquid Delegation and Decentralized Knowledge Base Access" (whew!).  It aims to combine reputation, voting power delegation, and access to a curated knowledge base, with a focus on incentivizing good behavior and preventing malicious voting power concentration.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

*   **Contract Name:** `ReputationGovernance`

*   **Concept:**  A DAO-like system where voting power is tied to reputation gained through contributions to a knowledge base and penalized for negative actions. Users can delegate their voting power, but the reputation of the delegate *also* affects the delegated power.  The knowledge base access is controlled by reputation thresholds, creating tiered access levels.

*   **Key Features:**

    *   **Reputation System:**  Users earn reputation points for submitting high-quality content to a knowledge base, reviewed by other users.  Reputation is deducted for submitting low-quality or malicious content, or for malicious voting behavior.
    *   **Knowledge Base Access:**  Different levels of reputation unlock different levels of access to a decentralized knowledge base.
    *   **Liquid Delegation:**  Users can delegate their voting power to other users.  The effective delegated voting power is influenced by the *delegate's* reputation, mitigating sybil attacks and encouraging responsible delegation.
    *   **Governance Proposals:**  Anyone can submit proposals, but the cost to submit a proposal is proportional to their reputation (higher reputation = lower cost).
    *   **Reputation-Weighted Voting:**  Voting power is a function of both reputation and delegated power.
    *   **Reputation Penalty for Bad Voting:** A negative reputation penalty is applied to voter who vote for malicious proposal (proposal that lead to drain of fund, bug exploit, etc) after the result of that proposal is executed.
    *   **Decentralized Knowledge Base:** The knowledge base consist of list of IPFS hash pointing to content.

*   **Functions Summary:**

    *   `submitContent(string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows users to submit content to the knowledge base (IPFS hash).  Requires a deposit.
    *   `reviewContent(address _author, string memory _ipfsHash, bool _isGood)`: Allows users to review submitted content.  Positive reviews increase the author's reputation; negative reviews decrease it.
    *   `delegateVotingPower(address _delegate)`: Allows users to delegate their voting power.
    *   `undelegateVotingPower()`: Removes delegation.
    *   `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _data)`: Creates a new governance proposal.
    *   `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _supports)`: Allows users to vote on a proposal.
    *   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it has reached quorum and a majority vote.
    *   `getReputation(address _user)`: Returns the reputation of a user.
    *   `getVotingPower(address _user)`: Returns the voting power of a user (based on reputation and delegation).
    *   `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the state of a proposal.
    *   `getContentAccessLevel(address _user)`: Returns the access level to the knowledge base based on user's reputation.
    *   `setAccessLevelThreshold(uint256 _level, uint256 _reputationThreshold)`: Set the required reputation level to get access level
    *   `setProposalSubmissionCostFactor(uint256 _factor)`: Set the cost factor for proposal submission (baseCost + reputation / _factor)
    *   `reportMaliciousVoting(uint256 _proposalId, address[] memory _voters)`: Report malicious voting by specific voters after a proposal execution (e.g., if a proposal led to fund drain).
    *   `withdrawDeposit(string memory _ipfsHash)`: Withdraw the initial deposit made when submitting content.
    *   `addGuardian(address _guardian)`: Add a guardian address
    *   `removeGuardian(address _guardian)`: Remove a guardian address
    *   `setReviewReward(uint256 _reward)`: Set the review reward for review content
    *   `setMaliciousVotingPenalty(uint256 _penalty)`: Set the malicious voting penalty
    *   `setMaxReputation(uint256 _maxReputation)`: Set maximum reputation allowed
    *   `setMinReputation(int256 _minReputation)`: Set minimum reputation allowed

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Reputation-Weighted Delegation:**  The delegated voting power is *influenced* by the delegate's reputation, discouraging delegation to low-reputation accounts, which could be sybil attacks.  The exact formula (`delegateVotingPower.mul(votingPower).div(100)`) is adjustable.
*   **Decentralized Knowledge Base (Placeholder):**  The `submitContent` and `reviewContent` functions provide a basic framework. In a real-world scenario, this would be integrated with a decentralized storage system like IPFS.  The content access levels would then be used to grant/restrict access to content based on reputation.  The `getContentAccessLevel` function determines access based on reputation thresholds.
*   **Guardian System:** The `guardians` mapping and `onlyGuardian` modifier enable a set of trusted users to flag and penalize malicious voting.  This is important for preventing attacks that could exploit the governance system.
*   **Governance Token Integration (Placeholder):**  The `governanceTokenAddress` is included, although not fully implemented. A real-world version would likely use an ERC20 token for staking and potentially for rewarding good behavior.  The total supply of token is used as total voting power for now, but it can be change.
*   **Proposal Submission Cost:**  The cost to submit a proposal is dynamic, based on the user's reputation.  This helps prevent spam proposals from low-reputation accounts and encourages responsible proposal creation.
*   **Malicious Voting Penalty:** Guardians can report voters who supported malicious proposals, leading to a reputation penalty. This discourages voters from supporting proposals that could harm the system.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  The contract uses `SafeMath` to prevent overflow/underflow errors, which is good practice.  However, the `getTotalVotingPower` function is a major gas bottleneck. In a real deployment, you'd need to optimize this significantly (e.g., using a running total updated by events).
*   **Security Considerations:**  The `executeProposal` function uses `address(this).call(proposal.data)`, which is *extremely dangerous* due to reentrancy vulnerabilities and other risks.  **DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT EXTREMELY CAREFUL AUDITING AND SECURITY MEASURES.**  You'd likely want to limit the types of actions that proposals can execute (e.g., by whitelisting specific contract functions or using a more restricted execution environment).
*   **User Registry:**  The current `getTotalVotingPower` implementation is a placeholder.  A real system would require a registry of users to accurately calculate the total voting power.
*   **Error Handling:**  More detailed error messages and event logging would be helpful for debugging and auditing.
*   **Tokenomics:** A robust tokenomics model would be necessary to incentivize participation, reward good behavior, and punish bad behavior.  The current contract only has a rudimentary deposit and review reward system.
*   **IPFS Integration:** The integration with IPFS for storing and retrieving content needs to be fully implemented.

**Disclaimer:**  This is a complex and potentially vulnerable contract. It's provided as an example of advanced concepts and should **not** be used in production without thorough auditing, testing, and security review.  I have made a best effort to provide a secure and functional example, but I cannot guarantee its safety.
