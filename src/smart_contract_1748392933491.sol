Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept for a "Quantum Vault". It incorporates multiple advanced features like conditional releases based on time, blocks, dependencies, external data (oracle simulation), zero-knowledge proof verification simulation, deposit splitting/merging, probabilistic release factors, and tiered access control. It aims for creativity by combining these elements in a novel way.

This is a complex contract, and some features (like real ZK proof verification or robust randomness) are simplified or simulated for demonstration purposes within the constraints of a Solidity example.

**Contract Outline & Function Summary: QuantumVault**

**1. Contract Name:** `QuantumVault`

**2. Description:**
A multi-asset vault that allows users to deposit ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens under highly flexible, composite release conditions. Conditions can include specific timestamps/blocks, dependencies on other deposits being released, external data checks via an oracle, successful verification of a zero-knowledge proof, and even a probabilistic "quantum fluctuation" factor. The contract supports managing these conditional deposits through splitting, merging, and ownership transfer, and includes advanced governance/manager functions.

**3. Core Concepts:**
*   **Deposit:** Represents assets (ERC-20 or ERC-721) locked in the vault under a specific `ReleaseCondition`. Each deposit has a unique ID.
*   **ReleaseCondition:** A complex struct defining when and how a deposit can be withdrawn. Can combine multiple types of conditions.
*   **Roles:** Owner (full control), Manager (operational control, configuration), Deposit Owner (can manage their specific deposit).
*   **External Interactions:** Simulated Oracle (for external data), Simulated ZK Verifier (for proof verification).
*   **Quantum Factor:** A configurable probabilistic element influencing release checks.

**4. Key Features:**
*   Deposit multiple asset types (ERC-20, ERC-721).
*   Flexible release conditions (time, block, dependency, oracle, ZK proof, probability).
*   Composite conditions (multiple conditions can be required).
*   Deposit management (transfer ownership, split ERC-20, merge ERC-20).
*   Configurable fees for operations.
*   Pause functionality.
*   Tiered access control (Owner, Manager).
*   Events for transparency.

**5. Function Summary (28 Functions):**

21. `mergeFungibleDeposits(uint256 depositId1, uint256 depositId2, ReleaseCondition memory mergedCondition)`: Merges two ERC-20 deposits into a single new deposit. Requires deposit owner and manager approval for complex merges.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Composite & Dynamic Conditions:** The `ReleaseCondition` struct allows for a combination of conditions (time, block, dependency, oracle, ZK). The `_checkBasicConditionsMet` function handles the deterministic ones, while separate functions (`attemptReleaseWithOracleCheck`, `attemptReleaseWithZKProof`) are required for the external checks that need specific input data. The `conditionType` enum is mostly illustrative, with the logic checking specific fields.
2.  **External Oracle Interaction:** The contract defines an `IOracle` interface and requires an oracle address to be set. `attemptReleaseWithOracleCheck` calls an external oracle contract's `checkCondition` function. This simulates interaction with external real-world data feeds or complex off-chain computations.
3.  **ZK Proof Verification Simulation:** The contract defines an `IZKVerifier` interface and requires a verifier address. `attemptReleaseWithZKProof` calls an external verifier contract's `verifyProof` function, simulating the requirement for a valid zero-knowledge proof to unlock funds. In a real scenario, the verifier would be a specialized contract (potentially using precompiled curves) capable of verifying proofs (e.g., SNARKs, STARKs).
4.  **Dependent Deposits:** The `dependentDepositId` allows creating chains or trees of dependencies, where one deposit cannot be released until another specific deposit has been.
5.  **Quantum Factor:** The `quantumFactor` in `ReleaseCondition` combined with the global `quantumIntensity` introduces a probabilistic element controlled by the manager. The `_checkQuantumFactor` function uses on-chain data (which is *not* truly random and can be influenced by miners/validators) for a simple pseudo-random check. This adds a unique, albeit simplified for demonstration, element of uncertainty. *For production, a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) like Chainlink's would be necessary for secure randomness.*
6.  **Deposit Splitting & Merging:** `splitFungibleDeposit` and `mergeFungibleDeposits` allow users to manage their positions granularly. Splitting creates two new deposits from one ERC-20 deposit. Merging combines two into a new one. These operations involve careful state management (marking originals as consumed/cancelled, creating new deposit entries). The merging logic includes a requirement for manager approval for condition setting, adding a layer of governance/control.
7.  **Tiered Access & Configurability:** Owner, Manager, and Deposit Owner roles provide different levels of control. Fees and external contract addresses (Oracle, ZK Verifier) are configurable, allowing for dynamic adaptation.
8.  **ERC721Holder Integration:** Inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `ERC721Holder` allows the contract to safely receive ERC-721 tokens and implements the necessary `onERC721Received` hook.

This contract goes beyond typical vault or time-lock contracts by integrating external data dependencies, proof verification, probabilistic elements, and complex internal state transitions for deposit management.
