Okay, let's design a smart contract that simulates a "Quantum Treasure Hunt". This combines concepts like probabilistic outcomes, entanglement, and dynamic states inspired *metaphorically* by quantum mechanics, implemented using Solidity features like VRF for randomness, ERC-721 for treasures, and complex state management.

It will not duplicate common patterns like standard DeFi pools, simple token issuance, basic NFT minting, or plain DAOs.

**QuantumTreasureHunt Smart Contract**

**Outline & Summary:**

This contract implements a game where players can "observe" locations that exist in a state of "superposition" (uncertainty). Observing a location collapses its state probabilistically, revealing either a hidden "Quantum Treasure" (an ERC-721 NFT), a penalty, or nothing. The game incorporates "entanglement," where observing one location can probabilistically affect the state of another, and "quantum tunneling," allowing players holding specific treasures to jump between locations under certain conditions. VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is used to ensure fair and unpredictable outcomes.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Location Superposition:** Locations exist in an initial uncertain state (`Superposition`).
2.  **Observation:** Players pay a fee to "observe" a location, triggering a state collapse via VRF.
3.  **Probabilistic Outcome:** Upon observation, the outcome (Treasure, Penalty, Nothing) is determined based on predefined weights for that location using random numbers.
4.  **State Collapse:** A location's state changes from `Superposition` to `ObservationPending` (awaiting VRF) then `Observed` (outcome revealed).
5.  **Quantum Treasures (ERC-721):** Successful observation of a treasure outcome allows the player to claim a unique NFT. Treasures can have simulated "quantum properties" (metadata).
6.  **Entanglement:** Locations can be linked. Observing one entangled location has a probability of triggering an effect (e.g., collapsing the state, applying penalty) on the linked location.
7.  **Quantum Tunneling:** Players who have claimed specific treasures can "tunnel" to certain locations, potentially bypassing the observation fee or altering the outcome probabilities.
8.  **Penalties:** Observations can result in negative outcomes defined by the contract owner.
9.  **VRF Integration:** Uses Chainlink VRF (or a mock) for secure and verifiable randomness.
10. **State Management:** Tracks the state of each location, claimed treasures, and player interactions.

**Function Summary (Approx. 24+ functions):**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract, VRF, ERC721, Ownable, Pausable.
2.  `addLocation`: Owner adds a new location with initial properties and outcome probability weights.
3.  `setLocationProbabilityWeights`: Owner adjusts the probabilities for outcomes (Treasure, Penalty, Nothing) for a specific location.
4.  `addTreasureToLocationPool`: Owner adds a potential treasure type (linked to NFT metadata) that can be found in a specific location pool.
5.  `addPenaltyType`: Owner defines a new type of penalty with associated parameters (e.g., fee multiplier, temporary lock duration).
6.  `setObservationFee`: Owner sets the fee required to observe a location (in native currency, e.g., ETH).
7.  `observeLocation`: Player function to initiate the observation process for a location (pays fee, triggers VRF request).
8.  `fulfillRandomWords`: VRF callback function, processes the random output, determines the outcome, updates location state, triggers entanglement if applicable.
9.  `claimTreasure`: Player function to claim the ERC-721 NFT if their observation resulted in finding a treasure.
10. `setLocationEntanglement`: Owner links two locations for entanglement, sets probability and effect type.
11. `setEntanglementProbability`: Owner adjusts the probability for an existing entanglement link.
12. `setEntanglementEffectType`: Owner changes the type of effect for an existing entanglement (e.g., collapse, apply penalty, change probability temporarily).
13. `performQuantumTunnel`: Player function to use the tunneling feature to interact with a specific location, potentially using claimed treasures as a key/cost.
14. `setQuantumTunnelingCost`: Owner sets the fee or required items (e.g., specific claimed treasures) for tunneling to certain locations.
15. `setRequiredTreasuresForTunneling`: Owner defines which claimed treasure types are needed to tunnel to specific locations.
16. `getTreasureCurrentValue`: (Simulated) Calculates a dynamic value for a claimed treasure based on its properties or game state.
17. `setLocationObservationLimit`: Owner sets a maximum number of times a location can be observed before its outcomes are depleted or it becomes inactive.
18. `resetLocationState`: Owner function to reset a location back to superposition (use cautiously, affects ongoing observations/claims).
19. `pauseContract`: Owner function to pause core game interactions (observe, claim, tunnel).
20. `unpauseContract`: Owner function to resume the contract.
21. `withdrawFees`: Owner function to withdraw collected observation fees.
22. `setVRFCoordinator`: Owner sets the address of the VRF Coordinator.
23. `setLinkToken`: Owner sets the address of the LINK token used for VRF requests.
24. `setKeyHash`: Owner sets the key hash for VRF requests.
25. `setCallbackGasLimit`: Owner sets the callback gas limit for VRF fulfillment.
26. `checkIfLocationObserved`: View function to check the state and outcome of a location.
27. `getPlayerClaimedTreasures`: View function to list treasures owned by a player.
28. `getTreasureDetails`: View function to get metadata and properties of a specific claimed treasure.
29. `getLocationDetails`: View function to get configuration details of a location (probabilities, limits, entanglement).
30. `checkTunnelingCapability`: View function to check if a player meets the requirements to tunnel to a specific location.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Functions:**

1.  **Probabilistic Outcomes & State Collapse (`observeLocation`, `fulfillRandomWords`, `LocationState`, `probWeights`):** Locations don't just *have* a treasure; they have *probabilities* of outcomes. The act of `observeLocation` (paying a cost) initiates a state change from `Superposition` to `ObservationPending`. `fulfillRandomWords` (the VRF callback) is the "measurement" that collapses the state to `Observed` based on the random outcome. This mirrors the quantum concept of a system being in a superposition until measured.
2.  **Weighted Probabilities (`setLocationProbabilityWeights`, `addTreasureToLocationPool`, `_selectTreasureTypeFromPool`):** Outcomes aren't uniformly random but are based on configurable weights, allowing for rare treasures or more frequent penalties in certain locations. The treasure *type* found is also probabilistically selected from a location-specific pool.
3.  **Entanglement (`setLocationEntanglement`, `setEntanglementProbability`, `setEntanglementEffectType`, `_triggerEntanglement`):** This introduces a non-local correlation. Observing one location can influence the state or properties of a separate, entangled location, based on a probability and a defined effect. The effects (like collapsing the linked state) are metaphorical quantum interactions. (Note: The implementation of entanglement *effects* in `_triggerEntanglement` was simplified for function count vs. complexity, but the *structure* for defining and triggering entanglement is there).
4.  **Quantum Tunneling (`performQuantumTunnel`, `setRequiredTreasuresForTunneling`, `checkTunnelingCapability`):** Allows players who have achieved certain conditions (e.g., collected specific "Quantum Treasures") to interact with locations bypassing the normal observation cost. This is a metaphor for tunneling through a potential barrier, requiring specific "properties" (claimed treasures) to do so.
5.  **Dynamic Treasure Properties/Value (`addTreasurePropertyDefinition`, `ClaimedTreasure` struct, `getTreasureCurrentValue`):** While not fully implemented with complex property assignment and state-changing values in this example, the structure allows for treasures to have defined properties (`TreasurePropertyDefinition`). `getTreasureCurrentValue` is a placeholder demonstrating how value *could* be dynamically calculated based on these properties or external factors, rather than being a fixed value. This hints at dynamic NFTs.
6.  **Penalty System (`addPenaltyType`, `_applyPenalty`, `_checkPenaltyLocks`, `playerObservationLocks`):** Observation isn't just about finding treasure; it carries risk. Defined penalties can impose costs or temporary locks, adding a game theory element.
7.  **State-Dependent Interactions (`onlyLocationState`, `observeLocation`, `claimTreasure`):** Player actions are strictly dependent on the current `LocationState`, ensuring the game flow (Superposition -> Pending -> Observed).
8.  **VRF Integration (`VRFConsumerBaseV2`, `requestRandomWords`, `fulfillRandomWords`, `s_requests`):** Secure, on-chain randomness is crucial for fair probabilistic outcomes. Chainlink VRF provides this verifiable randomness, with state management (`s_requests`) to track pending outcomes.
9.  **ERC-721 for Treasures (`ERC721Enumerable`, `_safeMint`, `claimedTreasures`):** Treasures are unique NFTs, making them collectible, tradable (if allowed), and potentially usable as keys for other mechanics like tunneling. `ERC721Enumerable` adds the ability to list tokens owned by an address, useful for `getPlayerClaimedTreasures`.
10. **Observation Limits (`setLocationObservationLimit`):** Adds scarcity to locations, making outcomes from locations with low limits potentially more valuable or sought after.
11. **Location Reset (`resetLocationState`):** An admin tool allowing the game to be updated or seasons to be reset, returning locations to their initial uncertain state (carefully handled to avoid disrupting pending VRF requests).
12. **Pausable:** Standard security pattern to halt critical operations in case of emergency.
