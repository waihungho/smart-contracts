 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to submit artwork,
 * members to curate and vote on submissions, mint NFTs for approved artworks, manage exhibitions,
 * and participate in collective governance. This contract aims to foster a community-driven art ecosystem.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Functionality (Art Submission & Curation):**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Artists submit artwork proposals.
 *    - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members vote to approve or reject artwork submissions.
 *    - `finalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Finalizes an artwork after passing voting threshold, mints NFT.
 *    - `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Rejects an artwork that fails voting threshold, burns the proposal.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about an artwork proposal.
 *    - `getArtworkVotingStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Checks the current voting status of an artwork.
 *
 * **2. Membership Management:**
 *    - `applyForMembership(string _artistStatement, string _portfolioLink)`: Users apply to become members of the collective.
 *    - `voteOnMembership(address _applicant, bool _approve)`: Existing members vote on membership applications.
 *    - `finalizeMembership(address _applicant)`: Finalizes membership after passing voting threshold.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _memberAddress)`: Allows members to be removed by governance vote.
 *    - `getMemberDetails(address _memberAddress)`: Retrieves details of a collective member.
 *    - `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *
 * **3. NFT Minting & Management:**
 *    - `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal) Mints an ERC721 NFT for an approved artwork.
 *    - `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Allows transferring ownership of an artwork NFT (by artist).
 *    - `burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows burning/removing an artwork NFT (governance decision).
 *    - `getArtworkNFTAddress(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves the NFT address for a specific artwork.
 *
 * **4. Exhibition & Showcase Features:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _description)`: Creates a new virtual art exhibition.
 *    - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds an approved artwork to an exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Removes an artwork from an exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of an art exhibition.
 *    - `listExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Lists all artworks currently in an exhibition.
 *
 * **5. Governance & Parameters:**
 *    - `proposeParameterChange(string _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)`: Members propose changes to contract parameters.
 *    - `voteOnParameterChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on parameter change proposals.
 *    - `finalizeParameterChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Finalizes a parameter change after voting.
 *    - `getParameter(string _parameterName)`: Retrieves the current value of a contract parameter.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows owner to set the default voting duration.
 *
 * **6. Utility & View Functions:**
 *    - `getTotalArtworks()`: Returns the total number of submitted artworks.
 *    - `getTotalMembers()`: Returns the total number of members in the collective.
 *    - `getTotalExhibitions()`: Returns the total number of exhibitions created.
 *    - `getContractBalance()`: Returns the current contract balance.
 *    - `withdrawContractBalance(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows owner to withdraw contract balance.
