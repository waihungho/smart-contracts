/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to showcase,
 * curate, and monetize their digital art through NFTs and community governance.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership & Roles:**
 *   - `joinCollective()`: Allows artists to apply for membership in the collective.
 *   - `approveMembership(address _artist)`: Curator function to approve artist membership applications.
 *   - `revokeMembership(address _artist)`: Curator function to revoke artist membership.
 *   - `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *   - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the total number of members in the collective.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *   - `submitArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Members can submit their artwork for curation.
 *   - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 *   - `getCurationThreshold()`: Returns the current curation approval threshold.
 *   - `setCurationThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: Curator function to set a new curation approval threshold.
 *   - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork.
 *   - `getArtworkStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current status of an artwork (submitted, approved, rejected).
 *   - `getRandomApprovedArtworkId()`: Returns a random ID of an approved artwork (for showcasing).
 *
 * **3. NFT Minting & Marketplace:**
 *   - `mintNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to mint an NFT for an approved artwork.
 *   - `setNFTPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Curator function to set the price of an artwork NFT.
 *   - `purchaseNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows anyone to purchase an NFT for a listed artwork.
 *   - `getNFTPrice(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current price of an artwork NFT.
 *   - `getNFTOwner(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current owner of an artwork NFT.
 *
 * **4. Decentralized Governance & Treasury:**
 *   - `proposePolicyChange(string memory _proposalDescription, bytes memory _data)`: Members can propose changes to collective policies.
 *   - `voteOnPolicyChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on policy change proposals.
 *   - `executePolicyChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Curator function to execute approved policy changes.
 *   - `getPolicyProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a policy proposal.
 *   - `contributeToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to contribute ETH to the collective's treasury.
 *   - `withdrawTreasuryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Curator function to withdraw funds from the treasury.
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 *
 * **5. Advanced Features:**
 *   - `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power to another address.
 *   - `revokeVotingDelegation()`: Allows members to revoke their voting power delegation.
 *   - `getVotingPower(address _voter)`: Returns the voting power of an address (considering delegation).
 *   - `pauseContract()`: Curator function to pause the contract in case of emergency.
 *   - `unpauseContract()`: Curator function to unpause the contract.
