/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 *      that allows artists to submit art proposals, community voting for curation,
 *      NFT minting for approved art, revenue sharing, dynamic NFT metadata,
 *      AI-powered art generation integration (concept), and governance features.
 *
 * Outline & Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  Art Proposal Submission (`submitArtProposal`): Artists submit art proposals with metadata.
 * 2.  Art Proposal Voting (`voteOnArtProposal`): DAO members vote on art proposals.
 * 3.  Finalize Art Proposal (`finalizeArtProposal`): Admin/Oracle finalizes proposal outcome after voting period.
 * 4.  Mint Art NFT (`mintArtNFT`): Mints an NFT for an approved art proposal.
 * 5.  Reject Art Proposal (`rejectArtProposal`): Admin/Oracle can reject a proposal.
 * 6.  Propose Governance Change (`proposeGovernanceChange`): DAO members propose changes to governance parameters.
 * 7.  Vote on Governance Change (`voteOnGovernanceChange`): DAO members vote on governance proposals.
 * 8.  Execute Governance Change (`executeGovernanceChange`): Admin/Oracle executes approved governance changes.
 * 9.  Stake Tokens (`stakeTokens`): Users can stake tokens to become DAO members and gain voting power.
 * 10. Unstake Tokens (`unstakeTokens`): Users can unstake their tokens.
 * 11. Delegate Vote (`delegateVote`): DAO members can delegate their voting power.
 * 12. List Art NFT for Sale (`listArtNFTForSale`): Artists can list their minted NFTs for sale within the DAAC marketplace.
 * 13. Buy Art NFT (`buyArtNFT`): Users can buy NFTs listed in the DAAC marketplace.
 * 14. Set Art NFT Price (`setArtNFTPrice`): Artists can set or change the price of their listed NFTs.
 * 15. Withdraw Artist Earnings (`withdrawArtistEarnings`): Artists can withdraw earnings from NFT sales.
 * 16. Withdraw Collective Earnings (`withdrawCollectiveEarnings`): DAO treasury manager can withdraw collective earnings.
 * 17. Get Art Proposal Details (`getArtProposalDetails`): Retrieve details of an art proposal.
 * 18. Get NFT Details (`getNFTDetails`): Retrieve details of a minted NFT.
 * 19. Get User Staking Balance (`getUserStakingBalance`): Check a user's staking balance.
 * 20. Get Collective Balance (`getCollectiveBalance`): Check the DAAC's contract balance.
 * 21. Set Dynamic NFT Metadata (`setDynamicNFTMetadata`): (Advanced) Allows for updating NFT metadata based on external events or oracle data.
 * 22. AI Art Generation Request (`requestAIArtGeneration`): (Concept) Demonstrates potential integration with AI for art creation requests (requires off-chain AI service).
 * 23. Pause Contract (`pauseContract`): Admin function to pause core functionalities in case of emergency.
 * 24. Unpause Contract (`unpauseContract`): Admin function to resume contract functionalities.
 * 25. Get Contract Version (`getContractVersion`): Returns the version of the smart contract.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The core concept itself is trendy, aligning with the rise of DAOs and community-driven initiatives in the Web3 space.
2.  **Art Proposal and Curation System:**  This is a decentralized approach to art curation, moving away from centralized galleries or platforms. The community decides what art gets recognized and minted as NFTs.
3.  **DAO Governance:**  Incorporating governance features allows the community to evolve the DAAC, change parameters, and have a say in its future direction.
4.  **Staking for Membership and Voting Power:**  This aligns with common DAO practices to ensure committed participation and prevent sybil attacks.
5.  **Vote Delegation:**  Allows DAO members to delegate their voting power to more active or knowledgeable members, enhancing participation.
6.  **NFT Marketplace within the DAAC:**  Creating a marketplace specifically for DAAC-curated NFTs fosters a closed-loop ecosystem.
7.  **Platform Fee and Revenue Sharing:**  A sustainable model where a portion of NFT sales goes back to the collective treasury to fund future initiatives, while artists are also rewarded.
8.  **Dynamic NFT Metadata (Advanced):** The `setDynamicNFTMetadata` function demonstrates the concept of NFTs that can evolve. In a real-world scenario, this could be linked to oracle data or external events to update NFT metadata, making NFTs more interactive and responsive. Imagine an NFT's appearance changing based on sales volume, community sentiment, or even real-world environmental data.
9.  **AI Art Generation Request (Concept - Very Trendy):** The `requestAIArtGeneration` function is a forward-looking, conceptual feature. It hints at the potential integration of AI art generation within a decentralized art platform. While this function itself is basic in this example, the concept is highly relevant and trendy, showcasing how blockchain and AI could intersect in creative fields. In a more developed system, this could be a powerful tool for artists and the community.
10. **Pause/Unpause Mechanism:** Essential for security and emergency situations, allowing the admin to temporarily halt core functions if vulnerabilities or critical issues are detected.

**Key Features that are "Advanced" for a Smart Contract:**

*   **Complex State Management:** Managing art proposals, governance proposals, NFTs, staking, and marketplace listings requires careful state management and data structures (structs, mappings).
*   **Access Control with Multiple Roles:**  Using `onlyAdmin`, `onlyTreasuryManager`, and `onlyDAO` modifiers enforces different levels of access and permissions, crucial for security and governance.
*   **Event Emission:**  Comprehensive use of events for tracking key actions and enabling off-chain monitoring and integrations.
*   **Voting and Governance Logic:** Implementing voting mechanisms for both art curation and governance changes adds a layer of complexity and decentralized decision-making.
*   **Marketplace Functionality:**  Building in marketplace features (listing, buying, pricing, revenue sharing) within the contract goes beyond basic token or NFT contracts.
*   **Conceptual Integration of Dynamic NFTs and AI:** While not fully implemented in this example, the inclusion of functions for dynamic metadata and AI art generation showcases forward-thinking and advanced concepts.

**Important Notes:**

*   **ERC721 Implementation:** This contract is a conceptual framework. To make it fully functional with NFTs, you would need to integrate ERC721 standard logic for token minting, ownership, and transfers (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's ERC721 library).
*   **Off-Chain Integration for AI:** The AI art generation concept requires significant off-chain infrastructure (AI models, API integrations, oracles) to work in practice.
*   **Security Audits:**  For a real-world deployment, this contract would need thorough security audits.
*   **Gas Optimization:** This example prioritizes functionality and clarity. Gas optimization would be a crucial step for a production-ready contract.
*   **Token Standard:**  The staking mechanism is simplified for native tokens. In a real DAAC, you would likely use an ERC20 token for staking and governance, requiring integration with an external token contract.

This contract provides a robust foundation and incorporates many advanced and trendy concepts for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective. You can further expand upon these features and integrate more sophisticated mechanisms to create a truly innovative and functional DAAC platform.
