 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery with advanced features 
 *      including dynamic NFT metadata, collaborative curation, fractional ownership, AI-powered 
 *      exhibition selection, and community governance.
 *
 * Function Outline and Summary:
 *
 * 1.  `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _curator)`: Initializes the gallery with a name and initial curator.
 * 2.  `setGalleryName(string _newName)`: Allows the gallery owner to change the gallery name.
 * 3.  `registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistBio, string _artistWebsite)`: Allows artists to register with the gallery.
 * 4.  `approveArtist(uint256 _artistId)`:  Curator function to approve a registered artist.
 * 5.  `submitArtwork(uint256 _artistId, string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkCID, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Artists submit artwork for consideration.
 * 6.  `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to approve submitted artwork, minting an NFT.
 * 7.  `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to reject submitted artwork.
 * 8.  `setArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string _newArtworkCID)`: Allows updating artwork metadata (e.g., after restoration or new interpretation).
 * 9.  `createExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256[] _artworkIds)`: Curator function to create an exhibition with selected artworks.
 * 10. `voteForExhibitionArtwork(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Gallery members can vote for artworks to be included in exhibitions (AI-assisted curation).
 * 11. `finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curator function to finalize an exhibition after voting and AI curation.
 * 12. `buyFractionalOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _shares)`: Allows users to buy fractional ownership of an artwork.
 * 13. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Artwork owners (including fractional owners) can list their shares for sale.
 * 14. `buyListedShare(uint256 _listingId)`: Allows users to buy listed shares of an artwork.
 * 15. `removeListing(uint256 _listingId)`: Allows the seller to remove a listing.
 * 16. `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Allows full artwork owners to transfer ownership (if not fractionally owned).
 * 17. `proposeGalleryUpgrade(string _upgradeDescription, string _upgradeCID)`: Community members can propose upgrades to the gallery (governance).
 * 18. `voteOnUpgradeProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Gallery members can vote on upgrade proposals.
 * 19. `executeUpgrade(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Owner function to execute an approved upgrade proposal (potentially complex logic - placeholder).
 * 20. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Owner/Curator function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 * 21. `setPlatformFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Owner function to set the platform fee percentage on sales.
 * 22. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`:  Function to retrieve detailed information about an artwork.
 * 23. `getArtistDetails(uint256 _artistId)`: Function to retrieve detailed information about an artist.
 * 24. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Function to retrieve detailed information about an exhibition.
