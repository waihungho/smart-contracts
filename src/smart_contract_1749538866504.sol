Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several interesting, advanced, and creative concepts beyond typical open-source examples. It focuses on conditional access to digital assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) based on various factors like attestations, time locks, vault states, required NFTs, and simulated proof verifications.

It's named `QuantumVault` to reflect its complex, multi-faceted locking and unlocking mechanisms.

// --- Outline ---
// 1. Contract Description: QuantumVault - A multi-asset vault with advanced conditional access controls.
// 2. Concepts:
//    - Conditional Withdrawals: Access to assets depends on multiple criteria.
//    - Attestations: On-chain verifiable claims or properties tied to addresses/entities.
//    - Vault States: Different operational modes affecting contract behavior.
//    - Time Locks: Minimum time periods before certain actions are possible.
//    - NFT Keys: Requiring ownership of specific NFTs for actions.
//    - Simulated Proofs: Integration point for off-chain validity proofs (ZK-like simulation).
//    - Manager Roles: Delegated permissions for specific administrative tasks.
// 3. Storage: Mapping for ERC20 balances, ERC721 ownership, Attestations, Managers, Proof Hashes.
// 4. Events: Signaling key state changes and actions.
// 5. Modifiers: Restricting function access.
// 6. Enum: Defining possible Vault States.
// 7. Struct: Defining the structure of an Attestation.
// 8. Core Functions:
//    - Asset Deposits (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)
//    - Asset Withdrawals (Conditional)
//    - Attestation Management (Add, Update, Get, Check, Remove)
//    - Vault State Management
//    - Time Lock Management
//    - Required NFT Management
//    - Simulated Proof Management
//    - Role Management (Managers)
//    - Utility/View Functions
// 9. ERC721Holder Implementation: Necessary for receiving NFTs.
// 10. Receive/Fallback: Enabling direct ETH deposits.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Conditional Withdrawals (`withdrawETH`, `withdrawToken`, `withdrawNFT`):** This is the central concept. Asset release isn't just based on ownership, but requires a combination of multiple dynamically configurable conditions.
2.  **Attestation System:** The contract acts as a simple registry for verifiable claims (`Attestation` struct). These claims can be added, updated, removed, and importantly, checked (`hasAttestation`) with an expiration timestamp. This moves beyond simple boolean flags to structured, time-sensitive data points about users or entities.
3.  **Vault States (`VaultState` enum):** The contract can operate in different modes (`Active`, `Restricted`, `Locked`). These states can globally alter the contract's behavior, such as disabling withdrawals entirely in `Restricted` or `Locked` states, providing a centralized kill-switch or pause mechanism based on external conditions or governance decisions.
4.  **Time Locks (`withdrawalTimelockEnd`, `setWithdrawalTimelock`):** A global mechanism to prevent *any* withdrawal before a certain time, adding a mandatory waiting period regardless of other conditions.
5.  **NFT Keys (`requiredNFTAddress`, `requiredNFTId`, `hasRequiredNFT`, `setRequiredNFT`):** Requires the withdrawal caller to hold a *specific* NFT (defined by contract address and token ID) in their wallet. This turns an NFT into a permission-granting key.
6.  **Simulated Proof System (`expectedProofHashes`, `submittedProofHashes`, `registerExpectedProofHash`, `submitProofAttestation`, `hasSubmittedProof`, `verifyProofConditions`):** This simulates interaction with off-chain validity proofs (like ZK proofs) without performing complex on-chain verification. A manager registers an `expectedHash` representing the desired output or commitment of a valid proof. A user `submitProofAttestation` by providing the proof data off-chain and sending the hash of that data on-chain. The contract then checks if the submitted hash matches the expected hash for a given `proofType`. This pattern is used in some ZK bridges and identity systems where the expensive verification is done off-chain, but the contract needs to record *that* proof data matching a known commitment was presented.
7.  **Manager Roles:** Introduces a layer of administrative privilege beyond just the owner, allowing delegation of tasks like managing attestations, vault state, timelocks, and required NFTs.
8.  **Combined Conditional Logic (`_checkWithdrawalConditions`):** The core withdrawal logic explicitly checks *all* relevant conditions (State, Timelock, Required NFT, Specific Required Attestations, Required Simulated Proof) in a single function. This complex `AND` logic makes access highly customizable and dependent on a holistic state.
9.  **ERC721Holder Integration:** Properly implements the `onERC721Received` hook, which is necessary for the contract to *securely* receive ERC721 tokens using `safeTransferFrom`. It also includes simple tracking of NFT counts per collection.

This contract goes significantly beyond simple token management or basic access control by weaving together multiple interdependent conditions and data types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, time, booleans, hashes, enums, structs) that must *collectively* be met for key actions like withdrawals. The Attestation and Simulated Proof systems add layers related to identity, verifiable claims, and off-chain computation integration in novel ways for a single vault contract.
