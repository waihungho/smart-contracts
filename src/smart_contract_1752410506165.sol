Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced and creative concepts, focusing on a secure vault with multi-stage, state-dependent, and potentially non-deterministic release mechanisms. We'll call it "QuantumVault" to reflect the complex and somewhat unpredictable nature of its release conditions, inspired metaphorically by quantum mechanics.

This contract will combine:
1.  **State Machine:** The vault progresses through distinct phases.
2.  **Time-Based Conditions:** Release is only possible within specific time windows.
3.  **External Data Dependency (Simulated Oracle):** Release requires an external data feed to be within a certain range.
4.  **Internal Complexity Metric:** Release requires the contract's internal state (e.g., number of depositors) to be above/below a threshold.
5.  **Simulated Non-Determinism ("Quantum Collapse"):** A specific release phase ('QuantumFlux') requires a block-hash/timestamp-based check to succeed, simulating a non-deterministic trigger for the final release state.
6.  **Role-Based Access:** Owner and potentially a Controller role.
7.  **Multi-Asset Support:** Handling both Ether and a specified ERC20 token.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

/**
 * @title QuantumVault
 * @dev A multi-stage, state-dependent vault with complex release conditions
 *      inspired by quantum mechanics and external data feeds. Assets (ETH & ERC20)
 *      are locked and can only be released when a combination of time,
 *      simulated external data, internal state complexity, and a simulated
 *      quantum 'collapse' event align.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1.  State Management: Define and manage the vault's lifecycle states.
 * 2.  Configuration & Initialization: Set up the vault's parameters and activate it.
 * 3.  Asset Management: Handle deposits of ETH and a specific ERC20 token.
 * 4.  Release Conditions: Define the complex criteria for unlocking funds.
 * 5.  External Data Integration (Simulated Oracle): Allow owner/controller to update a key external data point.
 * 6.  Internal State Complexity: Track and utilize internal metrics in conditions.
 * 7.  Simulated Quantum State & Collapse: Introduce a probabilistic element based on block data for state transition.
 * 8.  Query Functions: Allow users to check the vault's state, conditions, and their deposits/claims.
 * 9.  Claim & Withdrawal: Allow eligible users to claim funds and the owner to clean up.
 * 10. Role Management: Owner and Controller roles.
 * 11. Events: Announce key state changes and actions.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - constructor(address _erc20TokenAddress): Initializes the contract with the owner and the target ERC20 token address.
 * - initializeVault(uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, int256 _minOracleValue, int256 _maxOracleValue, uint256 _minComplexityThreshold, uint256 _maxComplexityThreshold, uint256 _quantumThreshold, uint256 _gracePeriod): Sets the core release parameters and transitions state to Initialized.
 * - activateVault(): Transitions state from Initialized to Active. Only callable by owner/controller.
 * - depositEther() payable: Allows anyone to deposit Ether into the vault while in Active state.
 * - depositERC20(uint256 amount): Allows anyone to deposit the specified ERC20 token while in Active state. Requires prior approval.
 * - setOracleValue(int256 value): Owner or Controller updates the simulated external data value.
 * - updateReleaseParameters(uint256 _newEndTime, int256 _newMinOracleValue, int256 _newMaxOracleValue, uint256 _newMinComplexityThreshold, uint256 _newMaxComplexityThreshold): Owner can adjust some release parameters during the Active state.
 * - triggerQuantumFluxPhase(): Owner or Controller attempts to transition from Active to QuantumFlux state if initial conditions (time, oracle, complexity) are met.
 * - attemptQuantumCollapse(): Anyone can call this function during the QuantumFlux state. It checks the block-data-based probabilistic condition. If met, transitions state to ReleaseReady.
 * - emergencyShutdown(): Owner can immediately transition to Completed state, potentially altering remaining release conditions (e.g., enabling owner withdrawal after grace period).
 * - claimFunds(): Allows a user to claim their deposited funds if the state is ReleaseReady and they meet individual claim requirements (e.g., haven't claimed, sufficient deposit). Handles both ETH and ERC20.
 * - ownerWithdrawRemainder(): Owner can withdraw any remaining funds after the grace period has passed and the vault is in the Completed state.
 * - transferOwnership(address newOwner): Transfers contract ownership.
 * - setController(address _controller): Owner sets/updates the address of the controller.
 * - getCurrentState(): Returns the current state of the vault.
 * - getVaultParameters(): Returns the configured release parameters.
 * - getDepositAmount(address user): Returns the Ether and ERC20 deposit amount for a specific user.
 * - getClaimStatus(address user): Returns whether a user has claimed their funds.
 * - isReleaseConditionMet(): Checks if the primary, deterministic release conditions (time, oracle, complexity) are currently met.
 * - getQuantumEntropyValue(): Calculates and returns the simulated quantum entropy value based on current block data.
 * - canAttemptQuantumCollapse(): Checks if the quantum collapse condition is met based on current block data and the quantum threshold.
 * - predictReleaseLikelihood(): Provides a rough predictive score/percentage indicating how close the vault is to the ReleaseReady state based on met conditions.
 * - getOracleValue(): Returns the current simulated oracle value.
 * - getERC20TokenAddress(): Returns the address of the supported ERC20 token.
 * - getController(): Returns the address of the current controller.
 * - getGracePeriod(): Returns the configured grace period duration.
 * - getContractETHBalance(): Returns the current ETH balance of the contract.
 * - getContractERC20Balance(): Returns the current ERC20 balance of the contract.

**Explanation of Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **State Machine (`VaultState` Enum):** The contract's behavior is strictly controlled by its current state (`currentState`). This is a common pattern but used here to enforce the multi-stage release process (`Inactive` -> `Initialized` -> `Active` -> `QuantumFlux` -> `ReleaseReady` -> `Completed`). Transitions are only allowed via specific functions and conditions.
2.  **Multi-Conditional Release:** The transition to `QuantumFlux` requires a combination of:
    *   **Time:** Within the `startTime` and `endTime` window.
    *   **Simulated Oracle:** `currentOracleValue` must be between `minOracleValue` and `maxOracleValue`. In a real-world scenario, `setOracleValue` would be called by a trusted oracle network (like Chainlink).
    *   **Internal Complexity:** The number of unique depositors (`_numberOfDepositors`) must be within `minComplexityThreshold` and `maxComplexityThreshold`. This links the contract's internal activity to the release condition.
3.  **Simulated Quantum State & Collapse:**
    *   The `QuantumFlux` state represents a period where deterministic conditions are met, but the final unlock requires a probabilistic trigger.
    *   `checkQuantumStateEntropy()` calculates a value based on `blockhash` and `block.timestamp`. While not true randomness, it's a common on-chain source of unpredictable variance between blocks.
    *   `canAttemptQuantumCollapse()` checks if this entropy value (modulo 100) meets the `quantumThreshold`. This simulates a random chance event.
    *   `attemptQuantumCollapse()` allows *anyone* to try to trigger the `ReleaseReady` state if the contract is in `QuantumFlux` and the `isQuantumCollapseConditionMet()` condition evaluates to true for the *current block*. This encourages users/bots to monitor the state and potentially pay gas to be the one to trigger the unlock.
4.  **Role-Based Access:** Uses `onlyOwner` and `onlyOwnerOrController` modifiers to restrict sensitive state transitions and parameter changes. A `controller` role is introduced to potentially delegate the triggering of `QuantumFlux`.
5.  **Multi-Asset Support:** Includes separate mappings and functions for handling both native Ether (`depositEther`, `claimFunds`) and a single specified ERC20 token (`depositERC20`, `claimFunds`). Requires the ERC20 interface and user approval for ERC20 deposits.
6.  **Predictive Likelihood:** `predictReleaseLikelihood()` offers a heuristic score based *only* on the deterministic conditions. It explicitly *doesn't* include the quantum condition, highlighting its separate, probabilistic nature.
7.  **Grace Period & Owner Remainder:** `gracePeriod` provides a window after the primary release phase (or emergency shutdown) before the owner can reclaim any unclaimed funds, giving users a final chance. `ownerWithdrawRemainder` handles this.
8.  **Extensive Query Functions:** Over 10 view functions are included to allow users and external systems to inspect the vault's state, parameters, individual deposit/claim status, and current values (oracle, entropy, complexity, balances), providing transparency into the complex mechanics.
9.  **Events:** Comprehensive events are emitted for state changes, deposits, parameter updates, attempts at quantum collapse, claims, and withdrawals, making it easy to track the contract's activity off-chain.
10. **Robustness:** Includes checks for invalid states, zero address checks, basic require statements, and handles potential transfer failures.

This contract moves beyond simple time locks or single conditions by layering multiple dependencies (time, external data, internal state) and introducing a unique, probabilistic (simulated) "quantum collapse" trigger that must be actively initiated by users/bots monitoring the chain. The state machine strictly enforces the intended flow.
