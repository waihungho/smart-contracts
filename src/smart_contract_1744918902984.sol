 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract Outline and Function Summary
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like DAO governance,
 *      NFT management, curated exhibitions, community features, and dynamic artist royalties.
 *
 * **Contract Overview:**
 * This contract creates a platform for artists to submit their digital artworks, which can be minted as NFTs.
 * A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governs the gallery, deciding on artwork curation, exhibitions,
 * royalty structures, and platform upgrades through community proposals and voting. The gallery features curated
 * exhibitions, community engagement tools, and mechanisms for artists to earn and be recognized.
 *
 * **Function Summary (20+ Functions):**
 *
 * **Gallery Setup & Governance (DAO):**
 * 1. `setGalleryName(string _name)`: Allows the gallery owner to set the name of the gallery.
 * 2. `requestDAOAccess()`: Allows users to request membership in the DAO to participate in governance.
 * 3. `approveDAOAccess(address _user)`: Allows DAO admins to approve membership requests.
 * 4. `revokeDAOAccess(address _user)`: Allows DAO admins to revoke DAO membership.
 * 5. `submitDAOProposal(string _title, string _description, bytes _calldata)`: Allows DAO members to submit proposals for gallery changes.
 * 6. `voteOnDAOProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows DAO members to vote on active proposals.
 * 7. `executeDAOProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed DAO proposal after voting period.
 * 8. `setDAOQuorum(uint256 _quorum)`: Allows DAO admins to change the quorum percentage needed for proposals to pass.
 *
 * **Artwork Management & NFT Minting:**
 * 9. `submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Allows artists to submit artwork for consideration.
 * 10. `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows DAO curators to approve submitted artwork for NFT minting.
 * 11. `mintNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved artwork, transferring ownership to the submitting artist.
 * 12. `setArtworkRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Allows artists to set their royalty percentage on secondary sales.
 * 13. `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Allows NFT owners to transfer ownership of their artwork.
 *
 * **Exhibition Management & Curation:**
 * 14. `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows DAO curators to create new exhibitions.
 * 15. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows DAO curators to add approved artworks to an exhibition.
 * 16. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows DAO curators to remove artworks from an exhibition.
 * 17. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Allows DAO curators to end an exhibition.
 *
 * **Community & Gallery Features:**
 * 18. `likeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to like artworks, tracking community preferences.
 * 19. `addCommentToArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string _comment)`: Allows users to add comments to artworks for discussion.
 * 20. `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string _reason)`: Allows users to report inappropriate or policy-violating artworks.
 * 21. `resolveArtworkReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _removeArtwork)`: Allows DAO admins to resolve artwork reports, potentially removing artwork.
 * 22. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artworks directly from the gallery (if gallery sales are enabled).
 * 23. `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Allows artists to withdraw their earnings from primary and secondary sales royalties.
 * 24. `donateToGallery()`: Allows users to donate ETH to the gallery treasury to support operations and development.
 * 25. `pauseContract()`: Allows the gallery owner to pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 * 26. `unpauseContract()`: Allows the gallery owner to unpause contract functions.
