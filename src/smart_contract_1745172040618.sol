 * @title Dynamic Reputation-Based Governance DAO Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
 * with dynamic governance parameters influenced by member reputation and engagement.
 * This DAO focuses on community-driven decision-making with advanced features like:
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Governance Parameters & Configuration:**
 *    - `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Allows a privileged role to update the quorum percentage required for proposal approval.
 *    - `getQuorumPercentage()`: Returns the current quorum percentage.
 *    - `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _votingPeriod)`: Allows a privileged role to set the voting period for proposals.
 *    - `getVotingPeriod()`: Returns the current voting period.
 *    - `setReputationBoostFactor(uint256 _reputationBoostFactor)`: Sets the factor by which reputation boosts voting power.
 *    - `getReputationBoostFactor()`: Returns the current reputation boost factor.
 *
 * **2. Member Reputation System:**
 *    - `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a privileged role to increase a member's reputation.
 *    - `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a privileged role to decrease a member's reputation.
 *    - `getReputation(address _member)`: Returns the reputation score of a member.
 *    - `stakeForReputation(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to stake ETH to boost their reputation temporarily.
 *    - `unstakeForReputation(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to unstake ETH and reduce their reputation boost.
 *    - `getReputationBoost(address _member)`: Calculates and returns the reputation boost for a member based on reputation score and staking.
 *
 * **3. Proposal Management:**
 *    - `propose(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, address _target)`: Allows members with sufficient reputation to create a proposal.
 *    - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal after the voting period.
 *    - `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Passed, Failed, Executed).
 *    - `getProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the support and against votes for a proposal.
 *    - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer to cancel a pending proposal before it becomes active.
 *
 * **4. Role-Based Access Control (Simple):**
 *    - `addAdmin(address _admin)`: Allows the contract owner to add an admin role.
 *    - `removeAdmin(address _admin)`: Allows the contract owner to remove an admin role.
 *    - `isAdmin(address _account)`: Checks if an account has the admin role.
 *
 * **5. Advanced & Trendy Functions:**
 *    - `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power to another member.
 *    - `revokeDelegation()`: Allows members to revoke their voting power delegation.
 *    - `getEffectiveVotingPower(address _voter, uint256 _proposalId)`: Calculates the voting power of a member, considering delegation and reputation boost, at the time of a specific proposal.
 *    - `distributeReputationReward(address[] memory _members, uint256 _totalReward)`: Distributes reputation points among multiple members proportionally based on their existing reputation (e.g., for community contributions).
 *    - `emergencyPause()`: Allows admins to pause critical functions of the DAO in case of emergency (e.g., security vulnerability).
 *    - `emergencyUnpause()`: Allows admins to unpause the DAO after an emergency.

        // **Simplified Example (Not Scalable for large DAOs):**
        //  This would require iterating through all possible members, which is inefficient.
        //  In a real DAO, you'd likely track members actively participating in governance.

        // **For a more realistic (but still simplified for example) approach, assume we have a function to get all members:**

**Explanation of Advanced/Trendy Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **Dynamic Reputation-Based Governance:**
    *   **Reputation System:**  The contract incorporates a reputation system where members earn reputation points based on contributions, engagement, or other criteria (managed by admins in this simplified example). Higher reputation can grant more influence in governance.
    *   **Reputation Boosted Voting Power:**  Reputation directly boosts voting power, making decisions more influenced by experienced and reputable members.
    *   **Staking for Reputation:** Members can stake ETH to further boost their reputation temporarily, demonstrating commitment to the DAO and potentially influencing voting outcomes. This is a trendy concept in DeFi and governance, linking financial commitment to influence.

2.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:**
    *   **Adjustable Quorum and Voting Period:**  Admin roles can dynamically adjust the quorum percentage and voting period. This allows the DAO to adapt its governance processes based on changing circumstances or community needs.

3.  **Voting Power Delegation:**
    *   **`delegateVotingPower()` and `revokeDelegation()`:** Members can delegate their voting power to other members they trust or who have more expertise on certain topics. This increases voter participation and allows for more informed decision-making by leveraging collective knowledge.

4.  **Effective Voting Power Calculation (`getEffectiveVotingPower()`):**
    *   This function combines base voting power, reputation boost, and delegated voting power to determine a member's actual voting influence for a proposal. This provides a nuanced and dynamic voting system.

5.  **Proportional Reputation Reward Distribution (`distributeReputationReward()`):**
    *   This function allows admins to distribute reputation rewards fairly among multiple members, proportionally to their existing reputation. This is a more sophisticated reward mechanism than simply giving everyone equal points, as it acknowledges past contributions and standing within the community.

6.  **Emergency Pause/Unpause (`emergencyPause()`, `emergencyUnpause()`):**
    *   In case of critical vulnerabilities or attacks, admin roles can quickly pause the DAO's core functionalities to prevent damage. This is a crucial security feature for decentralized systems.

**Non-Duplication and Creativity:**

*   While DAOs and reputation systems are not entirely new concepts, the combination of dynamic governance parameters, reputation-boosted voting power (including staking for reputation), voting delegation, and proportional reputation distribution creates a unique and advanced governance model.
*   The specific functions and how they interact are designed to be different from typical open-source DAO contracts, focusing on a more dynamic and reputation-centric approach.
*   The contract includes trendy elements like reputation staking and dynamic parameter adjustments, reflecting current interests in blockchain governance and DeFi.

**Number of Functions:**

The contract includes more than 20 functions, as requested, covering governance setup, reputation management, proposal lifecycle, role management, and advanced/trendy features.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security:** This is a conceptual example and has not been rigorously audited for security vulnerabilities. In a production environment, thorough security audits are essential.
*   **Scalability:** The `_getTotalVotingPowerForProposal()` function is a simplified placeholder and not scalable for a large DAO. Real-world DAOs need efficient membership and voting power tracking mechanisms.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract is written for clarity and demonstration of concepts, not for maximum gas optimization. Gas costs should be considered and optimized for production deployments.
*   **Role Management:** The role-based access control is very basic. For more complex DAOs, consider using more robust role management libraries or patterns.
*   **Membership Management:** This contract lacks a formal membership management system. A real DAO would need a way to manage members joining and leaving the DAO, potentially tied to token holdings or other criteria.

This contract provides a starting point and demonstrates how to combine advanced Solidity concepts and trendy ideas to create a more sophisticated and unique smart contract. Remember to adapt and expand upon this foundation based on the specific requirements and goals of your decentralized application.
