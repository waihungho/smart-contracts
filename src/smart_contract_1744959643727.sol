 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like:
 *      - Dynamic NFTs with evolving metadata based on community interaction.
 *      - Decentralized curation and exhibition voting powered by tokenized governance.
 *      - AI-assisted art evaluation and recommendation (simulated on-chain).
 *      - Artist royalty management and secondary market fee distribution.
 *      - Fractional ownership of high-value artworks.
 *      - Dynamic pricing mechanisms based on popularity and demand.
 *      - Community-driven storytelling and collaborative artwork descriptions.
 *      - Integration with decentralized storage (IPFS - simulated).
 *      - On-chain reputation system for artists and curators.
 *      - Gamified art discovery and engagement features.
 *      - Support for different media types (images, videos, 3D models - simulated).
 *      - Time-based exhibitions and limited-edition artwork releases.
 *      - Dynamic gallery theme and aesthetic customization (simulated).
 *      - Artist collaboration features and revenue sharing for joint artworks.
 *      - Integration with oracles for external data (e.g., popularity metrics - simulated).
 *      - Decentralized dispute resolution mechanism for artwork authenticity or ownership.
 *      - Progressive artwork reveal - hiding parts of artwork initially and gradually revealing.
 *      - Personalized art recommendations based on user preferences (simulated).
 *      - DAO-governed gallery upgrades and feature additions.
 *
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * 1. initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _governanceToken): Initializes the gallery with a name and governance token address.
 * 2. setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Allows the gallery owner to set the platform fee percentage for sales.
 * 3. registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistDescription, string _artistPortfolioLink): Allows users to register as artists with profile information.
 * 4. updateArtistProfile(string _newDescription, string _newPortfolioLink): Registered artists can update their profile information.
 * 5. submitArtworkProposal(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash, string _artworkMediaType, uint256 _suggestedPrice): Artists submit artwork proposals for curation.
 * 6. voteOnArtworkProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve): Governance token holders can vote on artwork proposals.
 * 7. finalizeArtworkProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Finalizes an artwork proposal after voting, minting NFT if approved.
 * 8. setArtworkSalePrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice): Artists can set or update the sale price of their approved artworks.
 * 9. purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to purchase artwork NFTs.
 * 10. createExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime): Allows curators (governance-voted) to create exhibitions.
 * 11. proposeArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId): Curators propose artworks for specific exhibitions.
 * 12. voteOnExhibitionArtwork(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId, bool _include): Governance token holders vote on artworks for exhibitions.
 * 13. finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Finalizes an exhibition after artwork voting, marking it as active.
 * 14. donateToArtist(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to donate to artists of specific artworks.
 * 15. reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string _reportReason): Allows users to report artworks for policy violations.
 * 16. resolveArtworkReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _removeArtwork): Gallery owner can resolve artwork reports and potentially remove artworks.
 * 17. createGovernanceProposal(string _proposalTitle, string _proposalDescription, bytes _calldata): Governance token holders can create proposals for gallery changes.
 * 18. voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support): Governance token holders can vote on governance proposals.
 * 19. executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a governance proposal if it passes.
 * 20. withdrawArtistEarnings(): Artists can withdraw their earnings from artwork sales and donations.
 * 21. withdrawGalleryFees(): Gallery owner can withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 * 22. getRandomArtRecommendation(): (Simulated AI recommendation) Returns a random artwork ID for recommendation.
 * 23. getArtworkDynamicMetadata(uint256 _artworkId): (Simulated Dynamic Metadata) Returns evolving metadata based on interaction.
