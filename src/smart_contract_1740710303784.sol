/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Reputation-Based Voting and Skill-Based Task Allocation
 * @author Your Name
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO with a unique twist: Reputation-based voting, where voting power scales with user reputation, and Skill-based task allocation, matching members with tasks based on their self-declared skills.  It allows for the creation of proposals, voting on proposals, completing tasks, and earning reputation.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **Structure Definitions:** Defines structs for members, proposals, tasks, and skill profiles.
 * 2.  **State Variables:** Stores DAO members, proposals, tasks, reputation, skill registries, and configuration settings.
 * 3.  **Event Definitions:** Defines events for member actions, proposal actions, task actions, and skill updates.
 * 4.  **Modifier Definitions:** Defines modifiers for access control and state validation.
 * 5.  **Initialization (Constructor):** Sets up the initial DAO owner and configuration parameters.
 * 6.  **Member Management:** Functions for joining the DAO, updating skill profiles.
 * 7.  **Reputation Management:** Functions for granting/revoking reputation based on task completion and community vote.
 * 8.  **Proposal Management:** Functions for creating proposals, voting on proposals (weighted by reputation), and executing approved proposals.
 * 9.  **Task Management:** Functions for creating tasks, claiming tasks (matched by skill), submitting task completions, and rewarding task performers.
 * 10. **Skill Management:** Functions for members to update their skills.
 * 11. **Emergency Stop Function:**  A kill switch to freeze core functionality in the event of an exploit (requires multi-sig approval).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `joinDAO()`: Allows a user to become a DAO member.
 * - `updateSkillProfile(string[] memory _skills)`: Allows a member to update their skill profile.
 * - `grantReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Grants reputation to a member (admin-only).
 * - `revokeReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Revokes reputation from a member (admin-only).
 * - `createProposal(string memory _description, address _target, bytes memory _calldata)`: Creates a new proposal.
 * - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows a member to vote on a proposal.
 * - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it has passed.
 * - `createTask(string memory _description, uint256 _reward, string[] memory _requiredSkills)`: Creates a new task with skill requirements.
 * - `claimTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Allows a member to claim a task if their skills match.
 * - `submitTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId, string memory _evidence)`: Allows a member to submit proof of task completion.
 * - `rewardTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId)`: Rewards the member who completed the task, based on community approval (similar vote mechanism to proposal).
 * - `updateMemberSkills(address _member, string[] memory _newSkills)`: Update the skills of a particular member (admin only, in case of spam or abuse).
 * - `emergencyStop()`: Allows the DAO admin to halt critical functionality.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Skill-Based Task Allocation:**  The contract now includes the `createTask`, `claimTask`, and `submitTaskCompletion` functions.  Crucially, `claimTask` incorporates *skill matching* logic. It checks if the claiming member possesses *all* the required skills for the task before allowing them to claim it.
* **Reputation-Based Voting:**  The `vote` function uses the voter's reputation (`members[msg.sender].reputation`) as their voting weight.  Members with higher reputation have a proportionally larger impact on the outcome of proposals.  The `createProposal` function now includes a minimum reputation requirement.
* **Emergency Stop:** The `emergencyStop` function provides a kill switch. This is crucial for security.  When activated, it prevents core functionality from being used, protecting the DAO from attacks. The modifier `notEmergencyStopped` prevents actions when stopped.
* **Events:** Extensive use of events.  Events are critical for off-chain monitoring and integration with user interfaces.  They allow you to track all significant actions within the DAO.
* **Clear Modifiers:** Modifiers like `onlyOwner`, `onlyMember`, `proposalExists`, `taskExists` and `notEmergencyStopped` drastically improve code readability and security by enforcing access control and state validation.
* **Structs for Organization:** The structs (`Member`, `Proposal`, `Task`) make the code easier to understand and maintain by grouping related data together.
* **Minimum Reputation Requirement:** Adding a minimum reputation requirement to create a proposal adds another layer of security and prevents spam proposals.
* **Gas Optimization:** Calculates the number of blocks needed to pass the voting period to avoid using block.timestamp which can be influenced by miners.
* **Error Handling:** Reverts with informative error messages. This is crucial for debugging and providing helpful feedback to users.  The `require` statements make it clear why a transaction failed.
* **Safety Checks:** The contract incorporates several safety checks to prevent common errors, such as dividing by zero and transferring Ether to an invalid address.

How to use this contract:

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the `SkillBasedDAO` contract to a testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) or mainnet.
2.  **Join the DAO:**  Call `joinDAO()` as a user to become a member.
3.  **Update Your Skill Profile:** As a member, call `updateSkillProfile()` to specify the skills you possess.
4.  **Create Tasks:** Call `createTask()` to create new tasks, specifying the reward, a description, and the required skills.
5.  **Claim Tasks:** Call `claimTask()` to claim a task if you have the required skills.
6.  **Submit Task Completions:** Call `submitTaskCompletion()` to submit evidence that you have completed a task.
7.  **Reward Task Completions:** Call `rewardTaskCompletion()` to reward the member who completed the task. (This would ideally involve a voting process).
8.  **Create Proposals:**  Call `createProposal()` to create a proposal for a specific action.
9.  **Vote on Proposals:**  Call `vote()` to vote on proposals.
10. **Execute Proposals:** Call `executeProposal()` to execute an approved proposal.
11. **Admin Actions:** The contract owner can use `grantReputation()`, `revokeReputation()` and `emergencyStop()` to manage the DAO.

This revised contract provides a strong foundation for a reputation-based, skill-based DAO.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  You'll likely want to add a front-end for users to easily interact with the contract.
