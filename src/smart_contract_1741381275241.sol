/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, 
 * allowing artists to submit art, community members to vote on art, 
 * generate collective NFTs, manage a treasury, and govern the platform.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * 1. **Art Submission and Curation:**
 *    - `submitArt(string _ipfsHash, string _title, string _description)`: Artists submit their art with IPFS hash, title, and description.
 *    - `editSubmission(uint _submissionId, string _ipfsHash, string _title, string _description)`: Artists can edit their submissions before voting starts.
 *    - `startSubmissionVoting(uint _submissionId)`: Owner starts voting for a specific art submission.
 *    - `castVote(uint _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Members cast their votes on art submissions.
 *    - `endSubmissionVoting(uint _submissionId)`: Owner ends voting and processes results (approve/reject).
 *    - `approveArt(uint _submissionId)`:  Function to manually approve art submission (can be used based on voting outcome logic).
 *    - `rejectArt(uint _submissionId)`: Function to manually reject art submission.
 *    - `getSubmissionDetails(uint _submissionId)`: View function to get details of an art submission.
 *    - `getVotingStatus(uint _submissionId)`: View function to get the current voting status of a submission.
 *    - `getAllSubmissions()`: View function to get a list of all submission IDs.
 *    - `getApprovedArtIds()`: View function to get a list of approved art submission IDs.
 *
 * 2. **Collective NFT Generation:**
 *    - `mintCollectiveNFT(uint _submissionId)`: Mints a collective NFT representing an approved artwork.
 *    - `getCollectiveNFTMetadata(uint _tokenId)`: View function to retrieve metadata for a collective NFT.
 *    - `totalSupplyCollectiveNFT()`: View function to get the total supply of collective NFTs.
 *
 * 3. **Membership and Governance:**
 *    - `joinCollective()`: Function for users to become members of the collective (e.g., by paying a fee or holding a governance token - simplified here).
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Function for members to leave the collective.
 *    - `isMember(address _user)`: View function to check if an address is a member.
 *    - `proposeGovernanceChange(string _proposalDescription)`: Members can propose governance changes.
 *    - `startGovernanceVoting(uint _proposalId)`: Owner starts voting on a governance proposal.
 *    - `castGovernanceVote(uint _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members cast votes on governance proposals.
 *    - `endGovernanceVoting(uint _proposalId)`: Owner ends voting on governance proposals and implements changes (simplified - actual implementation would vary greatly).
 *    - `getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint _proposalId)`: View function to get details of a governance proposal.
 *    - `getGovernanceVotingStatus(uint _proposalId)`: View function to get the voting status of a governance proposal.
 *
 * 4. **Treasury Management (Simplified - No actual treasury in this example, but functions for potential future expansion):**
 *    - `depositToTreasury()`: Placeholder function for depositing funds to a collective treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromTreasury(uint _amount)`: Placeholder function for withdrawing funds from a collective treasury (governance required in a real scenario).
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Placeholder view function to get the treasury balance.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 *   - `submitArt`: Allow artists to submit artwork with metadata.
 *   - `editSubmission`: Allow artists to edit their submitted artwork before voting.
 *   - `startSubmissionVoting`: Initiate voting for a specific art submission.
 *   - `castVote`: Members vote for or against an art submission.
 *   - `endSubmissionVoting`: Conclude voting and determine art approval based on votes.
 *   - `approveArt`: Manually approve an art submission (potentially based on voting outcome).
 *   - `rejectArt`: Manually reject an art submission.
 *   - `getSubmissionDetails`: Retrieve detailed information about an art submission.
 *   - `getVotingStatus`: Check the current voting status of an art submission.
 *   - `getAllSubmissions`: Get a list of IDs of all art submissions.
 *   - `getApprovedArtIds`: Get a list of IDs of approved art submissions.
 *
 * **Collective NFT Generation:**
 *   - `mintCollectiveNFT`: Generate a collective NFT for an approved artwork.
 *   - `getCollectiveNFTMetadata`: Retrieve metadata for a collective NFT.
 *   - `totalSupplyCollectiveNFT`: Get the total number of collective NFTs minted.
 *
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 *   - `joinCollective`: Allow users to become members of the collective.
 *   - `leaveCollective`: Allow members to leave the collective.
 *   - `isMember`: Check if an address is a member of the collective.
 *   - `proposeGovernanceChange`: Members can propose changes to the collective's governance.
 *   - `startGovernanceVoting`: Initiate voting on a governance proposal.
 *   - `castGovernanceVote`: Members vote on governance proposals.
 *   - `endGovernanceVoting`: Conclude governance voting and potentially implement changes.
 *   - `getGovernanceProposalDetails`: Retrieve details of a governance proposal.
 *   - `getGovernanceVotingStatus`: Check the voting status of a governance proposal.
 *
 * **Treasury Management (Placeholders):**
 *   - `depositToTreasury`: Allow depositing funds into the collective's treasury.
 *   - `withdrawFromTreasury`: Allow withdrawing funds from the collective's treasury (governance needed).
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance`: Check the current balance of the collective's treasury.
