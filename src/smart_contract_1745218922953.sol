 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, featuring advanced concepts
 * such as dynamic artwork pricing based on community engagement, artist reputation system, collaborative
 * exhibitions curated by community voting, fractionalized NFT ownership for high-value artworks, and
 * decentralized governance for gallery parameters.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Gallery Management:**
 * 1. `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _initialCurator)`: Initializes the gallery with a name and initial curator.
 * 2. `updateGalleryName(string _newGalleryName)`: Allows the curator to update the gallery name.
 * 3. `setCurator(address _newCurator)`: Allows the current curator to transfer curatorship to a new address.
 * 4. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows the curator to set the platform fee percentage for artwork sales.
 * 5. `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows the curator to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 * 6. `pauseGallery()`: Allows the curator to pause gallery operations (e.g., submissions, sales).
 * 7. `unpauseGallery()`: Allows the curator to resume gallery operations.
 *
 * **Artist Management & Reputation:**
 * 8. `applyForArtistMembership(string _artistStatement)`: Allows users to apply for artist membership with a statement.
 * 9. `approveArtistMembership(address _applicant)`: Allows the curator to approve artist membership applications.
 * 10. `revokeArtistMembership(address _artist)`: Allows the curator to revoke artist membership (with reasons, potentially governance-controlled later).
 * 11. `reportArtist(address _artist, string _reason)`: Allows gallery members to report artists for misconduct, affecting reputation.
 * 12. `getArtistReputation(address _artist)`: Returns the reputation score of an artist based on positive and negative community feedback.
 *
 * **Artwork Submission, Curation & Sales:**
 * 13. `submitArtwork(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Artists submit artwork proposals with details and initial price.
 * 14. `voteOnArtworkSubmission(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Gallery members can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks for gallery inclusion.
 * 15. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase approved artworks, transferring ownership and platform fees.
 * 16. `adjustArtworkPriceDynamically(uint256 _artworkId)`: Dynamically adjusts artwork price based on views, likes, and purchase history (advanced algorithm).
 * 17. `likeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Gallery members can 'like' artworks, influencing dynamic pricing and artist reputation.
 * 18. `viewArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Tracks artwork views, influencing dynamic pricing.
 * 19. `offerFractionalOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Artists can offer fractional ownership of high-value artworks as NFTs.
 * 20. `purchaseFraction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionId)`: Users can purchase fractional ownership NFTs of artworks.
 *
 * **Exhibitions & Community Engagement:**
 * 21. `createExhibitionProposal(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startDate, uint256 _endDate)`: Artists or curators can propose exhibitions with themes and timelines.
 * 22. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Gallery members vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 23. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator can add approved artworks to curated exhibitions.
 * 24. `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curator can start an approved exhibition.
 * 25. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curator can end an exhibition.
 *
 * **Governance & Parameters (Future Expansion - Basic Curator Control Implemented):**
 * 26. `proposePlatformFeeChange(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: (Future Governance Function) - Propose a change to the platform fee percentage, requiring community vote.
 * 27. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: (Future Governance Function) - Gallery members vote on governance proposals.
 * 28. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Future Governance Function) - Execute approved governance proposals.
 *
 * **Utility & View Functions:**
 * 29. `getGalleryName()`: Returns the name of the gallery.
 * 30. `getCurator()`: Returns the address of the current curator.
 * 31. `getPlatformFee()`: Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 * 32. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 33. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns details about a specific exhibition.
 * 34. `isArtist(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a registered artist.
 * 35. `isGalleryMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a general gallery member (for voting, etc.).
 * 36. `getPendingArtistApplicationsCount()`: Returns the number of pending artist membership applications.
 * 37. `getApprovedArtworkCount()`: Returns the total number of approved artworks in the gallery.
 * 38. `getActiveExhibitionCount()`: Returns the number of currently active exhibitions.
 * 39. `getTotalPlatformFeesEarned()`: Returns the total platform fees earned by the gallery.
