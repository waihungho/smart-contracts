Okay, here is a smart contract written in Solidity incorporating several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts beyond typical open-source examples. It's designed as a "Quantum Vault" â€“ a metaphor for a vault with complex, time-sensitive, and condition-dependent access mechanisms.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is a complex example demonstrating various concepts. It is for educational and illustrative purposes only. Deploying complex smart contracts on a mainnet requires extensive security audits, gas optimizations, and careful consideration of all edge cases, which are beyond the scope of this example. Oracle interactions, VRF, and external calls are simplified or simulated.

**QuantumVault Smart Contract**

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This contract acts as a multi-asset vault (ERC-20, ETH) with sophisticated access control, time-based logic, conditional execution based on external data (simulated), recurring payment setups, configurable delays for critical changes, role-based permissions, emergency functions, and potential hooks for randomness or external protocol interaction.

1.  **Core Vault Management:** Handling deposits and withdrawals of ERC-20 tokens and native ETH.
2.  **Access Control:** Implementing granular roles beyond simple ownership (Admin, Strategist, Guardian, Relayer).
3.  **Time-Based Access:** Setting up and executing withdrawals locked until a specific time or for recurring intervals.
4.  **Conditional Access:** Setting up and executing withdrawals contingent on external data (e.g., price feeds, simulated via parameters).
5.  **Configuration Management:** Implementing a delayed proposal-and-execution mechanism for sensitive configuration changes to enhance security and governance.
6.  **Emergency Procedures:** Functions for pausing the contract or allowing specific roles to perform emergency withdrawals.
7.  **Batch Operations:** Performing multiple deposits or withdrawals in a single transaction.
8.  **External Interaction Hooks:** Frameworks for triggering calls to other contracts or integrating with oracles/VRF (simulated/simplified).

**Function Summary (Total: 30 Functions):**

*   `constructor`: Initializes roles and configures proposal delay.
*   `receive`: Handles incoming ETH deposits.
*   `depositERC20`: Deposits a specified amount of an allowed ERC-20 token.
*   `depositETH`: Explicit function for depositing ETH (redundant with `receive` but good practice).
*   `withdrawERC20`: Standard withdrawal of an allowed ERC-20 token by the user.
*   `withdrawETH`: Standard withdrawal of native ETH by the user.
*   `getVaultBalance`: Returns the total balance of a specific token held by the vault contract.
*   `getUserTotalHoldings`: Returns the total logical holdings of a user across all tokens (based on internal accounting).
*   `getUserTokenHoldings`: Returns the logical holdings of a user for a specific token.
*   `addAllowedToken`: Admin function to whitelist a token for deposits/withdrawals.
*   `removeAllowedToken`: Admin function to unwhitelist a token.
*   `grantRole`: Admin function to grant a specific role to an address.
*   `revokeRole`: Admin function to revoke a specific role from an address.
*   `hasRole`: Check if an account has a specific role.
*   `proposeConfigChange`: Proposes a change to a configuration setting, starts the delay timer.
*   `cancelConfigProposal`: Cancels an active configuration proposal.
*   `executeConfigChange`: Executes a proposed config change after the delay period.
*   `setConfigProposalDelay`: Sets the time required between proposing and executing changes (itself subject to proposal/delay).
*   `setupTimeLockedWithdrawal`: Sets up a withdrawal request that can only be executed after a specific timestamp.
*   `cancelTimeLockedWithdrawal`: User cancels their pending time-locked withdrawal.
*   `executeTimeLockedWithdrawal`: User executes their time-locked withdrawal after the unlock time.
*   `setupRecurringWithdrawal`: Sets up a series of recurring withdrawals at fixed intervals.
*   `cancelRecurringWithdrawal`: User cancels a recurring withdrawal setup.
*   `executeRecurringWithdrawal`: User or authorized relayer triggers a single instance of a recurring withdrawal.
*   `setupConditionalWithdrawal`: Sets up a withdrawal request dependent on an external condition (simulated by parameters).
*   `cancelConditionalWithdrawal`: User cancels a pending conditional withdrawal request.
*   `executeConditionalWithdrawal`: Authorized role (Strategist/Guardian) executes a conditional withdrawal if the condition is met (simulated check).
*   `pause`: Guardian function to pause transfers and critical operations.
*   `unpause`: Guardian function to unpause the contract.
*   `emergencyWithdrawToken`: Guardian function to withdraw all of a specific token in an emergency.
