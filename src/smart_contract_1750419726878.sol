Okay, let's design a smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Fund (DAF). This DAF will allow members to pool capital, propose and vote on investment strategies (simulated via arbitrary contract calls), manage shares representing ownership, and handle fees.

This incorporates concepts like:
*   **DAO Governance:** Proposals, voting, execution of approved actions.
*   **Fund/Vault Mechanics:** Deposit, withdrawal based on share value.
*   **Fee Structures:** Entry, Exit, and a simplified Performance Fee.
*   **Arbitrary Call Execution:** Enabling the DAO to interact with other protocols (simulated).

We will aim for over 20 distinct functions covering these areas.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex smart contract example. It demonstrates advanced concepts but is simplified for illustration. A real-world implementation would require significant security audits, robust oracle solutions (for AUM calculation if holding multiple assets), more sophisticated performance fee logic, and careful gas optimization. Do not use this code in production without extensive review and auditing.

 * @title DecentralizedAutonomousFund (DAF)
 * @author YourNameHere (Example Implementation)
 * @notice A community-governed fund contract where participants can deposit, withdraw,
 *         and collectively vote on investment strategies or other arbitrary actions
 *         via a proposal system. Shares represent ownership in the fund's assets.

 * 3.  Enums
 * 4.  Structs
 * 5.  Modifiers
 * 6.  Constructor
 * 7.  Fund Management (Deposit, Withdraw)

 *
 * Function Summary (Total: 22 Functions):
 * - Fund Management:
 *     1. constructor: Initializes the fund with a base asset and governance parameters.
 *     2. deposit: Allows users to deposit the base asset and receive shares.
 *     3. withdraw: Allows shareholders to redeem shares for the base asset.
 * - Governance:
 *     4. createProposal: Creates a new governance proposal.
 *     5. cancelProposal: Cancels a pending proposal (usually by creator or admin).
 *     6. vote: Allows shareholders to vote on an active proposal.
 *     7. queueProposal: Transitions a successful proposal to the queued state (requires a timelock, simplified here).
 *     8. executeProposal: Executes the action of a queued proposal.
 * - Fee Management:
 *     9. setFeeParameters: Sets entry, exit, and performance fee percentages.
 *     10. getCollectedFees: Gets the total amount of fees collected.
 *     11. withdrawCollectedFees: Allows an authorized address to withdraw collected fees.
 *     12. collectPerformanceFee: Triggers calculation and collection of a simplified performance fee based on AUM increase.
 * - View Functions:
 *     13. getBaseAsset: Gets the address of the fund's base asset.
 *     14. getTotalAUM: Gets the total value of assets under management (AUM) in the base asset.
 *     15. getSharesOutstanding: Gets the total supply of fund shares.
 *     16. getShareValue: Gets the value of a single share in base asset units.
 *     17. getMemberBalance: Gets the share balance for a specific member address.
 *     18. getProposalState: Gets the current state of a specific proposal.
 *     19. getProposalDetails: Gets all details (target, calldata, description) of a proposal.
 *     20. getProposalVotes: Gets the current vote counts for a proposal.
 *     21. getGovernanceParameters: Gets the current governance parameters (voting period, thresholds, quorum).
 * - Admin/Parameter Setting:
 *     22. setGovernanceParameters: Sets governance parameters (callable via proposal or initial admin).
 *
 * Advanced/Creative Concepts Demonstrated:
 * - DAO Governance System (Proposals, Voting, Execution).
 * - Share-based Fund Ownership similar to ERC-4626 concepts (shares tied to AUM).
 * - Entry, Exit, and Simplified Performance Fee mechanism.
 * - Arbitrary `call` execution via proposals for fund management/investments.
 * - State machine for proposals.
 * - Reentrancy protection for deposit/withdrawals.
