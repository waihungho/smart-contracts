 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - "ArtVerse"
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery where artists can submit artworks,
 * curators (DAO members) can vote on exhibitions, and users can purchase and collect digital art NFTs.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 *   - NFT Minting & Management: Artists submit artwork proposals, curators vote on approval, approved artworks are minted as NFTs.
 *   - Exhibition Management: Curators can create exhibitions, propose artworks for exhibitions, and vote on artwork selection.
 *   - Decentralized Governance (Simplified DAO):  Voting mechanisms for artwork approval and exhibition curation.
 *   - Revenue Sharing: Artists and the gallery (DAO treasury) share revenue from NFT sales.
 *   - Community Engagement:  Donations to support the gallery, artist tipping.
 *   - Dynamic Pricing:  Artwork price can be dynamically adjusted based on popularity (e.g., number of owners).
 *   - Artist Reputation:  Track artist reputation based on successful artwork sales and community feedback (simplified).
 *   - Blind Bidding Auctions:  Implement a blind bidding auction mechanism for premium artworks.
 *   - Fractional Ownership (Conceptual):  Laying groundwork for future fractionalization of high-value NFTs.
 *   - Collaborative Art Creation (Conceptual):  Framework for future collaborative art projects.
 *
 * **Functions (20+):**
 *
 * **Artist & Artwork Management:**
 *   1. `submitArtworkProposal(string memory _artworkURI, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to submit artwork proposals with URI and metadata.
 *   2. `voteOnArtworkProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Curators vote to approve or reject artwork proposals.
 *   3. `mintNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved artwork proposal (internal function after approval).
 *   4. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: Artists list their minted artworks for sale.
 *   5. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _tokenId)`: Users purchase listed artworks.
 *   6. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork NFT.
 *   7. `getArtistArtworks(address _artist)`: Retrieves a list of token IDs owned by a specific artist.
 *   8. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Artists can update the price of their listed artworks.
 *   9. `removeArtworkFromSale(uint256 _tokenId)`: Artists can remove their artwork from sale.
 *
 * **Exhibition Management:**
 *   10. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _votingDuration)`: Curators create new exhibitions with name, description, and voting duration.
 *   11. `proposeArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Curators propose artworks (token IDs) for a specific exhibition.
 *   12. `voteOnExhibitionArtwork(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _proposalIndex, bool _include)`: Curators vote to include or exclude proposed artworks in an exhibition.
 *   13. `finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Finalizes an exhibition after voting, selecting artworks based on votes.
 *   14. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition, including selected artworks.
 *   15. `getCurrentExhibitions()`: Retrieves a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *   16. `getPastExhibitions()`: Retrieves a list of past exhibitions.
 *
 * **Gallery Governance & Community:**
 *   17. `donateToGallery()`: Users can donate ETH to support the gallery.
 *   18. `tipArtist(uint256 _tokenId)`: Users can tip artists of specific artworks.
 *   19. `setDynamicPriceFactor(uint256 _factor)`: Gallery owner can set a factor for dynamic price adjustments.
 *   20. `withdrawGalleryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Gallery owner (or DAO in a more advanced version) can withdraw funds from the gallery treasury.
 *   21. `registerCurator()`: Allows users to register as curators (permissioned, potentially based on token holding in a real DAO).
 *   22. `removeCurator(address _curator)`: Gallery owner can remove curators.
 *
 * **Advanced/Conceptual Functions (Beyond 20, for demonstration of concepts):**
 *   23. `startBlindAuction(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _revealDuration)`: Starts a blind bidding auction for a premium artwork.
 *   24. `placeBlindBid(uint256 _auctionId, bytes32 _bidHash)`: Users place blind bids (hashed bids) in an auction.
 *   25. `revealBlindBid(uint256 _auctionId, uint256 _bidValue, bytes32 _salt)`: Users reveal their bids in an auction.
 *   26. `finalizeBlindAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Finalizes the blind auction and transfers NFT to the highest bidder.
 *   27. `collaborateOnArtwork(string memory _collaborationDetails)`: (Conceptual) Initiates a collaborative artwork project.
 *   28. `contributeToCollaboration(uint256 _collaborationId, string memory _contributionURI)`: (Conceptual) Artists contribute to collaborative projects.
 *
 * **Events:** (Numerous events are emitted for transparency, see code below)
