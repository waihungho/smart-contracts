Okay, let's design a smart contract that embodies a few advanced concepts:

1.  **Quantum-Inspired State Management:** Instead of a single, fixed state, a channel can exist in multiple "potential outcomes" simultaneously (conceptual superposition). An action ("observation") collapses it to a single outcome.
2.  **Trust & Reputation System:** Participants have on-chain trust scores influenced by interactions (successes, disputes, staking). This trust can influence outcome resolution.
3.  **Entangled Channels:** Channels can be linked, where resolving one might influence or trigger the resolution of others (conceptual entanglement).
4.  **Delegated Authority/Trust:** Users can delegate a portion of their trust or resolution authority to others.
5.  **Deterministic Collapse:** The function that resolves a channel deterministically selects an outcome based on predefined rules, participant trust, and state.
6.  **Arbitration & Dispute Resolution:** A mechanism for handling disagreements about the resolved state.
7.  **Staking for Influence/Trust:** Users can stake tokens to boost their influence or perceived trust within the system.

We'll call this contract `QuantumTrust`.

## QuantumTrust Smart Contract Outline

**Concept:** A system for managing complex interactions or agreements between parties using "Trust Channels". Each channel starts with multiple potential outcomes. A resolution process, influenced by participant trust and predefined weights, collapses the channel to a single deterministic outcome. Channels can be "entangled" (linked) to create dependencies. Users can build trust on-chain via staking and successful interactions, and even delegate this trust.

**Key Features:**

*   **Trust Channels:** Container for interaction details and potential outcomes.
*   **Potential Outcomes:** Discrete possible results for a channel, each with a required trust threshold and a deterministic weight.
*   **User Trust Scores:** Internal counter reflecting a user's standing.
*   **Trust Staking:** Allows locking an ERC20 token to boost perceived trust.
*   **Trust Delegation:** Granting another user the ability to use your trust score for specific actions.
*   **Entanglement:** Linking channels to create dependencies in resolution.
*   **Deterministic Resolution:** A function that calculates the final outcome based on rules (trust scores, weights) and collapses the channel state.
*   **Dispute Mechanism:** Allows participants to challenge a resolution, requiring arbitration.

**States:**

*   `Open`: Channel is active, outcomes can be added/modified.
*   `Resolving`: Resolution process has been initiated.
*   `Resolved`: A single outcome has been finalized.
*   `Disputed`: A resolution is being challenged.

**Token Usage:** Requires an external ERC20 token for staking (`stakingToken`).

## Function Summary (25 Functions)

1.  **`constructor`**: Initializes the contract, sets owner and default parameters.
2.  **`createTrustChannel`**: Creates a new Trust Channel between specified participants.
3.  **`addPotentialOutcome`**: Adds a possible outcome to an existing channel.
4.  **`removePotentialOutcome`**: Removes a potential outcome from an open channel.
5.  **`modifyOutcomeWeight`**: Changes the deterministic weight of a potential outcome.
6.  **`entangleChannels`**: Links one channel's resolution to another.
7.  **`signalPreferredOutcome`**: Allows a participant to signal their preference (may influence resolution, but not guarantee).
8.  **`resolveChannel`**: Initiates the resolution process, attempting to collapse the state to a single outcome based on rules and participant trust.
9.  **`confirmResolution`**: Allows participants to explicitly agree on the resolved outcome, potentially bypassing or accelerating deterministic resolution.
10. **`disputeResolution`**: A participant challenges the resolved state, moving the channel to `Disputed`.
11. **`finalizeDispute`**: Arbitrator or owner makes a final decision on a disputed channel.
12. **`stakeForTrust`**: Allows users to lock `stakingToken` to boost their influence/trust score calculation.
13. **`unstakeFromTrust`**: Initiates the process to unlock staked tokens (subject to cooling period).
14. **`withdrawStakedTokens`**: Allows users to withdraw tokens after the unstake cooling period.
15. **`updateTrustScoreByArbitrator`**: Arbitrator can manually adjust a user's score (e.g., for good/bad behavior observed off-chain or in disputes).
16. **`delegateTrustValue`**: Allows a user to delegate the *value* of their trust score (and stake) to another user for resolution purposes.
17. **`revokeTrustDelegation`**: Revokes a previously granted trust delegation.
18. **`getChannelDetails`**: View function to retrieve all details of a channel.
19. **`getPotentialOutcomes`**: View function to get potential outcomes for a channel.
20. **`getUserTrustScore`**: View function to get a user's current calculated trust score (including stake/delegation).
21. **`getEntangledChannels`**: View function to see channels linked to a given channel.
22. **`getChannelState`**: View function to get the current state of a channel.
23. **`getResolvedOutcome`**: View function to get the final outcome data if resolved.
24. **`setArbitratorAddress`**: Owner function to set the address responsible for dispute resolution.
25. **`setStakingTokenAddress`**: Owner function to set the ERC20 token used for staking.

        // And the `delegatedTrustAmounts[_delegatee][delegator]` structure still needed to track individual delegations for revocation.
        // Let's use this structure: `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) individualDelegations;`
        // and `mapping(address => uint256) totalDelegatedTrustReceived;`

        // Need to update state vars and relevant functions if this were a real contract.
        // For *this* view function demonstration, we'll assume `totalDelegatedTrustReceived` exists and is updated elsewhere.

        // and acknowledge that querying the sum for a delegatee is inefficient in a real contract.
        // A simple workaround for the VIEW function: iterate *potential* delegators, but that's not scalable.

        // We'll just use base + stake for simplicity in *this* example's `getUserTrustScore` view function,
        // and note the delegation aspect is conceptually part of "effective trust" but complex to sum on-chain efficiently.

        // `mapping(address => address) public delegatorToDelegatee;`
        // `mapping(address => uint256) public userDelegatedValue;` // The value the delegator is allowing delegatee to use

        // Let's revert to the initial `delegatedTrustAmounts[delegatee][delegator]` and sum it up here,
        // acknowledging the gas cost for a user with many delegators.
        // Summing up delegations *to* `_user`:
        // This is the inefficient part in Solidity. To sum delegations TO `_user`,

        // Let's assume this state variable exists and is maintained.
        //delegated = totalTrustDelegatedToUser[_user]; // Assuming this state variable is updated elsewhere

        // --- FINAL DECISION FOR EXAMPLE ---
        // Let's make the delegation simpler for this example: you delegate a *fixed* amount of trust value,
        // which is added to the delegatee's score calculation. We will *not* make it dependent on the delegator's
        // ever-changing effective trust. This simplifies `getUserTrustScore`.
        // Use `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) delegatedTrustAmounts;` as originally planned.
        // The `getUserTrustScore` will sum up amounts *delegated to* `_user`.

        // Cannot iterate through all potential delegators efficiently.
        // This requires a restructuring to `mapping(address => uint256) totalTrustDelegatedToUser;`
        // Let's add that state variable and update delegate/revoke functions.

        // --- State variables update: ---
        // Add: `mapping(address => uint256) public totalTrustDelegatedToUser;`
        // In `delegateTrustValue`: `totalTrustDelegatedToUser[_delegatee] += _amount;`
        // In `revokeTrustDelegation`: `totalTrustDelegatedToUser[_delegatee] -= revokedAmount;`
