Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "NeuroNet Oracle" - a concept where the contract simulates a very basic neural network layer (a weighted sum/dot product) with dynamically updatable weights managed by a decentralized group. It doesn't perform complex AI/ML *learning* on-chain due to gas constraints, but its "prediction" is based on learned parameters (weights) that can be updated via a multi-party confirmation process.

This concept is creative because it uses the blockchain not just for data storage or value transfer, but as a platform for a continuously parameterized calculation engine whose parameters evolve under governance. It's advanced in its state management for weight updates and the multi-party confirmation pattern. It's trendy in its nod towards on-chain data processing and decentralized control. It avoids duplicating standard ERC-20, NFT, or simple oracle/DAO patterns.

// --- Contract Outline: NeuroNet Oracle ---
// A smart contract that acts as a simple "NeuroNet" Oracle.
// It takes numerical feature vectors as input and computes a score
// based on internal weights.
// The weights can be updated, but only through a multi-party confirmation
// process managed by designated 'maintainers'.
// Other contracts/users can query the oracle's prediction score for submitted or new data.

// --- Function Summary: ---
// CORE ORACLE LOGIC:
// - predictScoreForVector(vector): Calculate prediction score for a given vector using current weights. (pure/view)
// - predictScoreForSubmitted(index): Calculate prediction score for a previously submitted vector. (view)
// - submitFeatureVector(vector): Store a new feature vector data point.
// - getSubmittedVector(index): Retrieve a submitted feature vector. (view)
// - getSubmittedVectorCount(): Get the total number of submitted vectors. (view)
// - getLastPrediction(): Get the result of the last prediction made (for tracking/history). (view)
// - getCurrentPredictionTimestamp(): Get the timestamp of the last prediction/weight update. (view)

// WEIGHT MANAGEMENT (The "NeuroNet" Parameters):
// - getWeights(): Retrieve the current set of weights. (view)
// - proposeWeightUpdate(newWeights): Propose a new set of weights. Only maintainers.
// - confirmWeightUpdateProposal(proposalIndex): Confirm a specific pending weight update proposal. Only maintainers.
// - revokeWeightUpdateProposal(proposalIndex): Revoke a confirmation from a proposal. Only maintainers.
// - applyWeightUpdate(proposalIndex): Apply a weight update proposal if enough confirmations are met. Only maintainers.
// - getPendingUpdateProposal(proposalIndex): Get details of a specific pending proposal. (view)
// - getPendingUpdateConfirmations(proposalIndex): Get confirmations for a proposal. (view)
// - getPendingProposalCount(): Get the number of pending proposals. (view)
// - getMinConfirmations(): Get the required number of confirmations to apply weights. (view)
// - setMinConfirmations(count): Set the required number of confirmations. Owner only.

// DATA MANAGEMENT & UTILITIES:

// - deleteSubmittedVector(index): Delete a specific submitted vector. Owner/Maintainer.
// - getHistoryWeights(index): Get a historical set of weights (if stored). (view) - *Note: Storing history can be very expensive.* (Decided against implementing history storage to save gas/complexity for this example, but leaving the concept in summary).
// - predictScoreWithHistoricalWeights(historyIndex, vector): Predict using historical weights. (pure/view) - *Not implemented due to history storage cost.*
// - getOwner(): Get the contract owner. (view)
// - getVersion(): Get the contract version. (view)

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **NeuroNet Simulation (Basic):** The core `predictScoreForVector` function performs a weighted sum (dot product) of an input vector (`int256[]`) and internal `currentWeights`. This is the simplest possible "neuron" model. The result is the "prediction" or "score".
2.  **Dynamic Weights:** The `currentWeights` are not fixed at deployment. This allows the oracle's behavior to evolve over time.
3.  **Decentralized Weight Updates (Multi-Party Control):** This is a key advanced feature. Instead of a single owner or a simple vote, weight updates require a multi-signature-like process:
    *   Any `maintainer` can `proposeWeightUpdate` with a new set of weights.
    *   Other `maintainers` must `confirmWeightUpdateProposal`.
    *   Once `minConfirmations` is reached, any `maintainer` can call `applyWeightUpdate`.
    *   This pattern is more robust than single-party control for sensitive parameters.
4.  **Maintainers:** A designated group of addresses controls the weight update process. The owner manages who is a maintainer.
5.  **Submitted Data:** Users can `submitFeatureVector` data points to the contract. These are stored and can be referenced by an index (`submittedDataCount`). This allows predicting on known, on-chain data points.
6.  **Prediction Queries:**
    *   `predictScoreForVector` allows anyone to calculate a score for *any* input vector using the *current* weights without storing the vector on-chain. This is a `view` function, gas-efficient.
    *   `predictScoreForSubmitted` calculates the score for data *already* submitted via `submitFeatureVector`.
7.  **State Tracking:** `lastPredictionScore` and `lastPredictionTimestamp` track the result and time of the most recent *applied* weight update or a prediction calculation that might update state (though prediction itself is `view`).
8.  **Proposal Management:** The contract tracks pending proposals, their confirmations, and the minimum required confirmations.
9.  **Data Management:** Functions to `clearSubmittedData` or `deleteSubmittedVector` are provided for managing storage, gated by owner/maintainer control.
10. **Extensibility:** The weight update mechanism and data submission pattern could be adapted for various complex on-chain systems where parameters need collective management based on internal or submitted data. The `int256[]` structure for vectors and weights is generic enough for many numerical inputs.
11. **Over 20 Functions:** The contract includes 25 public/external functions, fulfilling this requirement.
12. **No Duplication:** This specific combination of a simple on-chain weighted-sum model with decentralized, multi-party confirmed dynamic parameters and integrated data submission/querying is not a standard ERC or widely copied open-source pattern.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

*   **Gas Costs:** The dot product calculation's gas cost scales linearly with the length of the weight/vector array. Submitting data also costs gas. Storing weight history would be very expensive.
*   **Complexity of ML:** This is *not* a true neural network or machine learning model. There is no on-chain training or learning algorithm. The weight updates rely entirely on the maintainers' external knowledge and proposals.
*   **Numerical Precision:** Solidity uses integer types. Floating-point arithmetic would be needed for more complex ML models and would be significantly more complex/gas-intensive (requiring fixed-point libraries or similar). `int256` can represent a wide range, but products can still overflow if weights and inputs are very large. Standard Solidity 0.8+ checks for overflow/underflow for basic operations, but complex products might still require care or libraries like SafeMath if values are expected to be extreme.
*   **Maintainer Trust:** The system relies on the maintainers to propose and confirm meaningful weight updates. It's a form of decentralized control, but not fully trustless ML.
*   **Data Clearing:** Clearing all submitted data via the loop can hit block gas limits if `submittedDataCount` is huge. A real-world application with massive data might need a different storage pattern or a paginated/batched deletion process.
