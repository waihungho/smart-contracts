Okay, let's design a smart contract with an interesting, advanced, and relatively novel concept that isn't a direct copy of common open-source patterns like standard ERC20/721 implementations, basic staking, or generic DAOs.

We'll create a contract called `ChronoSphere` that represents a dynamic, time-evolving state influenced by user interactions and internal mechanics. Users can contribute "energy" (via token deposits), perform time-sensitive "synchronization" actions, and potentially earn rewards or generate unique digital artifacts based on the Sphere's state and their participation during specific "Temporal Epochs".

The concept involves:
1.  **Temporal Energy:** A core state variable that fluctuates based on time (decay) and user actions (contribution/sync).
2.  **User Synchronization:** Users perform periodic actions to "sync" with the Sphere, maintaining their connection and boosting their potential rewards.
3.  **Temporal Epochs:** Periodic events triggered when the Sphere reaches a certain energy threshold or time passes. During an epoch, rewards are distributed, potentially NFTs are minted, and the Sphere's state might partially reset.
4.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Some contract parameters (like decay rate, sync cost, epoch threshold) can be adjusted, potentially via a simple governance mechanism.
5.  **Predictive Elements & Bonding:** Users can view predictive data or even "bond" tokens for a share of *future* epoch rewards.

This combines elements of state management, time-based mechanics, resource sinks/faucets, periodic events, dynamic parameters, and basic future-state interaction.

// --- Outline ---
// 1. Core Concept: A dynamic, time-evolving system ('ChronoSphere') with user interaction.
// 2. State: Temporal Energy, User States (contributions, sync), Epoch History, Bonds.
// 3. Mechanics: Energy Decay/Growth, User Seeding (Token Deposit), User Synchronization, Epoch Triggering & Rewards.
// 4. Features: Parameter Management (basic governance), Temporal Artifact Generation (conceptual), Predictive Functions, Future Bonding.
// 5. Architecture: Ownable for admin, ReentrancyGuard for safety, IERC20 interaction.

// --- Function Summary ---

// --- Core State & Mechanics ---
// 1. updateTemporalEnergy: Internal helper to calculate state change based on time and interactions.
// 2. seedSphere: User deposits ERC20, increasing Temporal Energy and updating user state.
// 3. syncSphere: User performs a synchronization action, potentially consuming tokens/energy and updating user state for epoch rewards.
// 4. claimRewards: User claims accrued rewards from past epochs.
// 5. triggerEpoch: Initiates a Temporal Epoch if conditions met, distributing rewards, minting artifacts (if applicable), and resetting/adjusting state.

// --- User & State Information (View Functions) ---
// 6. getCurrentTemporalEnergy: Returns the calculated current Temporal Energy.
// 7. getUserState: Retrieves a specific user's state details.
// 8. getUserAccruedRewards: Calculates pending rewards for a user.
// 9. getSeedingTokenAddress: Returns the address of the token used for seeding.
// 10. getParameters: Returns the current contract parameters.
// 11. getLatestEpochId: Returns the ID of the most recently completed epoch.
// 12. getEpochHistory: Retrieves details of a specific past epoch.
// 13. getUserLastSyncTime: Returns the last timestamp a user synchronized.

// --- Parameter Management (Governance/Admin) ---
// 14. setSeedingToken: Admin function to set the approved seeding token (careful with this).
// 15. setParameters: Admin function to update various contract parameters.
// 16. proposeParameterChange: Allows authorized proposers to suggest parameter changes (basic governance).
// 17. voteForParameterChange: Allows authorized voters to vote on active proposals.
// 18. executeParameterChange: Executes a parameter change proposal if it meets voting requirements.

// --- Advanced & Creative Features ---
// 19. predictEpochYield: Estimates potential rewards for a future epoch based on current state and user participation (simplified).
// 20. bondFutureEpochShare: Allows users to lock tokens for a guaranteed share in a *future* epoch's rewards.
// 21. liquidateBond: Allows a user to cancel an active bond, potentially with a penalty.
// 22. generateTemporalArtifact: (Conceptual) Mints a unique token (NFT) whose characteristics are based on the Sphere's state during an epoch or sync event.
// 23. getTimeUntilNextEpoch: Estimates the time remaining until the energy threshold for the next epoch *might* be reached.

// --- Safety & Utility ---
// 24. withdrawSeedingTokens: Allows a user to withdraw their remaining seeded tokens (subject to rules).
// 25. emergencyAdminWithdraw: Admin function to recover accidentally sent tokens (standard good practice).

// --- Potential Future Additions (Not included for brevity/scope) ---
// - More complex governance with voting power based on participation/tokens.
// - Multiple token types for seeding or syncing.
// - Different types of Temporal Artifacts with unique properties.
// - Oracles for external data influencing the Sphere state.
// - User state migration/transfer.

            // A mapping from epoch ID to a list of bond IDs is needed for scalability.
            // Let's *assume* a way to get total bond share % for this epoch.

            // --- Simplified Bond Share Calculation ---
            // Let's track total promised bond share percentage *globally* or per future epoch.
            // This makes bonding create a claim on future % of reward pool.

            // nonBondRewardPool = rewardPoolAmount - bondRewardPool;
            // --- End Simplified Bond Share Calculation ---

            // Let's make bonds simpler: they just give a participation score *boost* in the target epoch.
            // So, `bondFutureEpochShare` just adds to the user's `epochParticipationScore` for that *future* epoch.
            // This avoids complex reward splitting logic during epoch trigger.
            // Revert `bondFutureEpochShare` and `liquidateBond` to this simpler model.

         // Energy loss per second = (100e18 * 1e15) / 1e18 = 100e15 (0.1 units/sec).
         // Time to decay 100 units = 100 units / 0.1 units/sec = 1000 seconds.
         // Formula: Energy / (DecayRatePerSecond / 1e18) -> 100e18 / (1e15 / 1e18) = 100e18 * 1e18 / 1e15 = 100e21 / 1e15 = 100e6 seconds. This is too large.

**Explanation of Concepts & Advanced Features:**

1.  **Temporal Energy:** The core mechanic. It's a dynamic, non-linear state variable. Its value isn't just a sum of deposits; it's affected by time (decay). This introduces a resource management element – the energy pool needs to be actively maintained.
2.  **Time-Based Decay/Growth:** `updateTemporalEnergy` internal function is crucial. It simulates a natural process where the Sphere's energy diminishes over time, counteracting user input and forcing ongoing interaction. This is more complex than simple additive/subtractive state changes.
3.  **User Synchronization:** A distinct action from just depositing. It might represent active engagement, costing a small amount but providing a benefit (like boosting participation score) that's vital for epoch rewards. This encourages *types* of interaction beyond just holding/depositing.
4.  **Temporal Epochs:** Periodic, high-impact events triggered by conditions (energy threshold, time cooldown). These act as breakpoints in the system's state, distributing value accrued over time and potentially resetting aspects of the state. This introduces cycles and strategic timing for users.
5.  **Epoch Participation Score:** A metric accrued by users through actions like syncing or seeding *within a specific cycle*. Rewards are distributed based on this score relative to the total score for that epoch, making participation dynamic and cycle-dependent.
6.  **Dynamic Parameters & Basic Governance:** The `Parameters` struct and the associated proposal/vote/execute functions allow the contract's core mechanics (decay rates, costs, thresholds, reward percentages) to be adjusted over time. This introduces upgradeability managed by a community (even if simplified here), making the contract adaptable without needing a full redeploy.
7.  **Predictive Function (`predictEpochYield`):** While simplified, this function attempts to provide users with foresight into the system's potential future state. In a real application, this would require off-chain computation or sophisticated on-chain modeling, but its inclusion introduces the concept of speculative analysis within the contract's data.
8.  **Future Bonding (`bondFutureEpochShare`):** Users can commit resources *now* for a benefit in a *future* state (a specific epoch). This is a form of on-chain forward contract or futures market, allowing users to lock in potential value and participate in an epoch cycle before it even begins. It introduces time-locking and future claim management. (Simplified significantly in this example to just boost participation score).
9.  **Temporal Artifacts (`generateTemporalArtifact` - Conceptual):** This hints at dynamic NFT generation. NFTs aren't pre-defined but are minted *based on the state of the system* at a specific powerful moment (an epoch). Their properties would be a function of variables like `temporalEnergy`, total participation, etc., making them unique historical records tied to the Sphere's evolution.
10. **Time Utilities (`getTimeUntilNextEpochRevised`):** Providing functions that give insight into the system's temporal state and potential next events (like cooldown ending) helps users strategize their interactions.

This contract moves beyond basic token/NFT management or simple staking by creating a self-contained, time-evolving ecosystem with multiple interconnected user actions and periodic high-impact events. The governance, bonding, and prediction elements add layers of complexity and interaction possibilities.

**Scalability Note:** As highlighted in the code comments, iterating over all users (e.g., for epoch reward distribution or calculating total seeded) is not gas-efficient or scalable on-chain for a large number of users. A production contract would require different data structures (like lists of active users, or mechanisms where users 'claim' their participation/rewards after an epoch) or accumulation patterns to avoid these expensive loops. The parameter governance is also very basic.

This contract is for demonstration of concepts and would require significant further development, optimization, and rigorous auditing for production use.
