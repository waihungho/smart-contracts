/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Curator (DAC) - NFT Reputation and Curation
 * @author Bard (Inspired by a collaborative human-AI brainstorming session)
 * @notice This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Curator (DAC) for NFTs.  It allows NFT holders to stake their NFTs to gain curation power and participate in a reputation system.
 *
 * Outline:
 *  1.  **ERC721 Interface:**  Interacts with ERC721 NFTs.  Requires a whitelisted ERC721 contract to be set.
 *  2.  **Staking/Unstaking:** Allows users to stake their NFTs to gain curation power. Staked tokens are locked in the contract.  Staking power increases with staking duration (linearly for simplicity, but could be more complex).
 *  3.  **Curation/Reputation:** Users can "endorse" other NFTs by staking against them.  The amount staked against an NFT determines its perceived reputation within the platform.  A threshold of endorsements can trigger automated listing on a secondary marketplace (simulated here with an event emission) or other actions.
 *  4.  **Rewards (Optional):** Stakers can receive rewards (e.g., governance tokens, marketplace fee discounts) for their participation in the curation process.  This example includes a simplified reward system based on staking duration and successful curations.
 *  5.  **Governance (Future Enhancement):**  The contract could be extended to allow token holders to vote on the staking power decay rate, the endorsement threshold, reward distribution, or even the whitelisted NFT contract.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - `constructor(address _nftContract)`: Initializes the contract with the whitelisted NFT contract address.
 *  - `setNftContract(address _newNftContract)`: Allows the owner to change the whitelisted NFT contract.
 *  - `stake(uint256 _tokenId)`: Stakes an NFT to gain curation power.
 *  - `unstake(uint256 _tokenId)`: Unstakes an NFT, releasing the NFT and claiming rewards.
 *  - `endorse(uint256 _tokenIdToEndorse, uint256 _stakeAmount)`: Stakes against another NFT, increasing its endorsement level.
 *  - `withdrawEndorsement(uint256 _tokenIdToEndorse, uint256 _amount)`: Withdraws endorsement stake from an NFT.
 *  - `isStaked(uint256 _tokenId)`: Checks if an NFT is staked.
 *  - `getStakingPower(address _staker)`: Returns the staking power of an address.
 *  - `getEndorsementLevel(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the total amount staked against an NFT.
 *  - `claimRewards(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows stakers to claim accrued rewards.
 *  - `getRewardAmount(uint256 _tokenId)`: Calculates the reward amount for a staked token.
 *  - `recoverERC20(address tokenAddress, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to recover accidental ERC20 transfers to the contract.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Decentralized Autonomous Curator (DAC) Concept:**  The core concept is to build a decentralized way to curate NFTs, essentially establishing a reputation system. This avoids centralized control over which NFTs are "popular" or "valuable."  This aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain.
* **Stake-based Curation:** Users don't just vote; they stake their NFTs (representing their commitment/belief) against other NFTs. The amount staked directly influences the perceived reputation.
* **ERC721 Integration:**  The contract *requires* a whitelisted ERC721 contract.  This is crucial.  The DAC only works for NFTs from a specific collection.  This prevents attacks and ensures that the curations are relevant.  The `setNftContract` function allows the owner to change the contract.
* **Staking Power:**  Staking time impacts staking power.  This encourages long-term participation and discourages flash staking.  This also creates a more resilient reputation system.
* **Endorsement Threshold & Automated Actions:** When an NFT reaches a certain endorsement threshold (a configurable parameter), the contract *emits an event `NFTListed`*. This simulates automated actions, such as:

    *   Automatic listing on a secondary NFT marketplace.
    *   Increased visibility within the platform.
    *   Eligibility for special rewards or features.
    *   In a more complex implementation, this could trigger a DAO proposal to use funding to buy the NFT for a community vault.

* **Rewards Mechanism:** The `claimRewards` and `getRewardAmount` functions offer a basic reward system. This rewards users for their curation efforts, encouraging participation. This part is designed to be expandable. In the future, the contract could be integrated with external reward tokens.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The code is relatively gas-efficient, but further optimizations are always possible, especially in the loop used for calculating rewards.
* **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Reentrancy:** While the current code doesn't directly handle external calls that are subject to reentrancy, the `claimRewards` function would require additional ReentrancyGuard protection if transferring out actual tokens.  This is a major potential vulnerability.  *Always use a ReentrancyGuard when dealing with external token transfers.*
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  If the list of endorsed NFTs becomes very large, operations like iterating through them could become gas-expensive and potentially block updates.  Consider using more efficient data structures or pagination techniques.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** The `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` mitigates this by default.
    *   **Front-Running:**  Endorsement decisions could be front-run (an attacker seeing your endorsement transaction and placing theirs right before yours to manipulate the price). Mitigations:
        *   Implement a commitment scheme.
        *   Use a decentralized price feed that's more resistant to manipulation.

* **Error Handling:** Uses `require` statements to enforce conditions and revert transactions if necessary, providing clear error messages.
* **Events:** Emits events for important state changes, allowing external applications to monitor and react to the contract's behavior.
* **Ownable:**  Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` to provide basic access control, allowing the contract owner to perform administrative tasks.  Crucial for upgrades and parameter adjustments.
* **ERC20 Recovery:** Includes a `recoverERC20` function to allow the contract owner to withdraw any accidental ERC20 tokens sent to the contract. This is a standard safety feature.
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-commented and structured for better understanding.
* **Upgradeable Contract (Important Considerations):**
    *   To make this contract truly production-ready, consider making it upgradeable using a proxy pattern (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` or `UUPSProxy`). This allows you to fix bugs or add new features without migrating all the data. *Upgradeable contracts are more complex and require careful planning and testing.*
    *   If using an upgradeable pattern, you *must* initialize all storage variables in an initializer function, not in the constructor.

This comprehensive approach provides a solid foundation for a Decentralized Autonomous Curator for NFTs. Remember to thoroughly test the contract and perform security audits before deploying it to a live environment.  The addition of governance mechanisms would take this from a proof-of-concept to a much more robust and decentralized application.
