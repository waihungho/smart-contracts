Okay, let's design a sophisticated, multi-faceted treasury contract incorporating various advanced concepts. We'll call it the `QuantumTreasury` â€“ reflecting its ability to handle complex states, conditional logic, and multiple asset types, with some features inspired by concepts like probability and entanglement (metaphorically, of course).

This contract will act as a central vault capable of holding ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and ERC-721 NFTs. It will feature robust access control, advanced distribution mechanisms, conditional releases, time-locked vaults, asset binding, and configuration capabilities.

**QuantumTreasury Contract Outline and Summary**

**Contract Name:** QuantumTreasury

**Purpose:** A multi-asset, access-controlled treasury designed for decentralized organizations or complex project needs. It supports ETH, ERC-20, and ERC-721 assets and includes advanced features beyond standard deposit/withdrawal.

**Key Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Support:** Holds and manages ETH, various ERC-20 tokens, and various ERC-721 NFTs.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Utilizes OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for granular permissions (Admin, Accountant, Operator roles).
3.  **Conditional Releases:** Ability to schedule asset releases contingent on future conditions (represented by a cryptographic hash or simple boolean state, fulfilled externally).
4.  **Probabilistic Distribution:** Distribute a single amount of an asset among multiple recipients based on configurable probabilities.
5.  **Time-Locked Vaults:** Allows locking assets within the treasury until a specified timestamp.
6.  **Asset Binding (Conceptual Entanglement):** Links a specific amount of an ERC-20 token to an ERC-721 NFT held within the treasury, requiring both to be involved in certain operations or enabling conditional access.
7.  **Atomic Swaps (Conceptual):** Function placeholder to interact with external DEX routers for asset conversion (requires external integration).
8.  **Batch Operations:** Execute multiple withdrawals or transfers in a single transaction.
9.  **Dynamic Configuration:** Allows privileged roles to update certain operational parameters.
10. **Circuit Breaker:** Emergency mechanism to pause sensitive operations.
11. **Yield Simulation/Tracking:** An internal conceptual feature to track potential yield accrual without direct interaction with external DeFi protocols (could be integrated later).
12. **Royalty Collection Integration:** Functionality to receive and potentially track royalty payments specifically.
13. **Supported Asset Management:** Control which assets (ERC20, ERC721) the treasury officially supports.
14. **Emergency Sweep:** Function for the admin to recover all assets in extreme scenarios.

**Roles:**

*   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Has control over roles and critical configuration.
*   `ACCOUNTANT_ROLE`: Manages standard deposits, withdrawals, batch operations, swaps.
*   `OPERATOR_ROLE`: Manages advanced features like conditional releases, time locks, probabilistic distribution, NFT binding.

**Function Summary (Over 20 Functions):**

*   **Core Treasury (6 functions):**
    *   `depositETH()`
    *   `depositERC20()`
    *   `depositERC721()`
    *   `withdrawETH()`
    *   `withdrawERC20()`
    *   `withdrawERC721()`
*   **Access Control (4 functions):**
    *   `grantRole()`
    *   `revokeRole()`
    *   `renounceRole()`
    *   `hasRole()`
*   **Asset Management & Information (4 functions):**
    *   `getERC20Balance()`
    *   `getNFTCount()`
    *   `isSupportedAsset()`
    *   `setSupportedAsset()`
*   **Advanced Operations (9 functions):**
    *   `scheduleConditionalRelease()`
    *   `fulfillConditionalRelease()`
    *   `distributeByProbability()`
    *   `lockFundsTime()`
    *   `unlockFundsTime()`
    *   `bindNFTForAccess()`
    *   `checkNFTAccess()`
    *   `performAtomicSwap()` (Conceptual placeholder)
    *   `batchWithdrawERC20()`
*   **Configuration & Control (3 functions):**
    *   `updateDynamicParameter()`
    *   `activateCircuitBreaker()`
    *   `depositRoyaltyPayment()` (Accepting/tagging inflow)
*   **State Tracking/Simulation (2 functions):**
    *   `simulateYieldAccrual()` (Conceptual)
    *   `getLockedFunds()` (Helper/View)
*   **Emergency & Recovery (1 function):**
    *   `emergencySweep()`
*   **Inherited/Helper Functions (e.g., `supportsInterface`, `_setupRole`)** - (These contribute to contract functionality but aren't typically counted in the 'user-callable function' list requirement, but we have plenty anyway).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Role-Based Access Control (`AccessControl`):** More advanced than a simple `Ownable`, allowing multiple administrators and specific roles (`ACCOUNTANT_ROLE`, `OPERATOR_ROLE`) for different tasks, promoting decentralization of responsibilities.
2.  **Conditional Releases (`scheduleConditionalRelease`, `fulfillConditionalRelease`):** Introduces time-based vesting combined with an abstract "condition" (represented by `conditionHash`). Fulfilling requires meeting the time *and* verifying the condition (conceptually via external proof or oracle). This allows for escrow-like features contingent on complex off-chain or on-chain events.
3.  **Probabilistic Distribution (`distributeByProbability`):** Distributes a total amount based on relative weights/probabilities provided. Useful for lottery-like distributions, tiered rewards, or simulations.
4.  **Time-Locked Vaults (`lockFundsTime`, `unlockFundsTime`):** Standard but essential for vesting or future availability of funds. Included as a core advanced treasury feature.
5.  **Asset Binding / Conceptual Entanglement (`bindNFTForAccess`, `checkNFTAccess`):** Links a specific amount of an ERC-20 token to an NFT held by the treasury. While not *actual* entanglement, it creates an on-chain relationship. This could be used for:
    *   NFT-gated access to specific treasury operations (check binding before allowing a withdrawal).
    *   Creating synthetic assets where holding the NFT represents a claim on the bound tokens.
    *   Adding "utility" to treasury-held NFTs.
6.  **Atomic Swaps (`performAtomicSwap`):** Acknowledges the need for asset conversion directly within the treasury by interacting with external DEX protocols. This keeps assets productive or converts them as needed for distributions without manual intervention. (Implemented as a placeholder requiring a router address).
7.  **Batch Operations (`batchWithdrawERC20`):** Gas-efficient way to distribute assets to multiple addresses in one transaction, common in airdrops or dividend payouts.
8.  **Dynamic Configuration (`updateDynamicParameter`):** Allows administrators to adjust certain contract parameters (like minimum withdrawal amounts, or in the yield simulation, conceptual rates) without needing a full contract upgrade, adding flexibility.
9.  **Circuit Breaker (`activateCircuitBreaker`):** A critical security feature to pause sensitive outflow operations in case of detected vulnerabilities or market instability.
10. **Yield Simulation (`simulateYieldAccrual`):** A creative, albeit conceptual, feature. It doesn't directly interact with DeFi yield farms (which would add significant complexity and risk) but allows the treasury to *internally track* a theoretical yield based on predefined parameters, useful for reporting or internal accounting within a DAO.
11. **Royalty Collection Tracking (`depositRoyaltyPayment`):** Provides a specific function to categorize incoming funds as royalties, allowing for separate tracking and reporting of this revenue stream.
12. **Supported Asset Management (`setSupportedAsset`, `isSupportedAsset`):** Explicitly controls which assets the treasury is designed to handle, mitigating risks associated with arbitrary token interactions.
13. **Emergency Sweep (`emergencySweep`):** A last-resort function for disaster recovery, allowing a trusted admin to move all assets to a safe address. This is distinct from regular withdrawals.
14. **Unsupported Asset Withdrawal (`withdrawUnsupportedAsset`):** Allows recovery of assets sent to the contract that were not intended to be supported or were sent in error, under strict admin control.
15. **`ERC721Holder`:** Necessary to safely receive NFTs according to ERC721 standard practices.

This contract combines standard treasury functions with several distinct and relatively advanced concepts, going beyond a typical multi-sig wallet or basic token holder. It's designed with flexibility and potential integration with external systems (oracles, DEXes) in mind, while keeping the core logic manageable within a single contract for demonstration.
