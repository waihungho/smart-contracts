/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling artists and enthusiasts to
 * collaborate, create, curate, and govern a digital art space.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Art NFT Management:**
 *    - `createArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to propose new art pieces.
 *    - `mintArtNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved art proposal, transferring ownership to the collective.
 *    - `transferArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId, address _recipient)`: Transfers ownership of an art NFT (governance required for collective-owned NFTs).
 *    - `getArtNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves metadata (title, description, IPFS hash) of an art NFT.
 *    - `burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Burns an art NFT (governance required).
 *
 * **2. DAO Governance & Membership:**
 *    - `applyForMembership(string memory _artistStatement)`: Allows users to apply for membership by submitting an artist statement.
 *    - `approveMembership(address _applicant)`: Allows existing members to vote to approve a membership application.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows members to propose and vote to revoke membership.
 *    - `depositGovernanceTokens()`: Allows members to deposit governance tokens (e.g., ERC20) into the collective's treasury.
 *    - `withdrawGovernanceTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to propose and vote to withdraw governance tokens from the treasury.
 *    - `proposeNewRule(string memory _ruleDescription)`: Allows members to propose new rules or changes to the collective's governance.
 *    - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows members to vote on active proposals (art, membership, rules, treasury).
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it has reached the required quorum and majority.
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 *    - `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the status (active, passed, rejected, executed) of a proposal.
 *
 * **3. Collaborative Art Features:**
 *    - `contributeToArt(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _contributionDescription, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to contribute to existing collective art pieces (proposals & voting for acceptance).
 *    - `createArtChallenge(string memory _challengeTitle, string memory _challengeDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows members to create art challenges with specific themes and rewards.
 *    - `submitArtForChallenge(uint256 _challengeId, string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to submit their art for active challenges.
 *    - `voteOnChallengeWinners(uint256 _challengeId, address[] memory _winningSubmissions)`: Allows members to vote on winning submissions for a completed art challenge.
 *    - `distributeChallengeRewards(uint256 _challengeId)`: Distributes rewards (e.g., governance tokens, NFTs) to winners of an art challenge (after voting).
 *
 * **4. Utility & Security Functions:**
 *    - `getContractBalance()`: Returns the current balance of governance tokens held by the contract.
 *    - `emergencyWithdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`:  (Admin/Governor controlled) Allows for emergency withdrawal of tokens in unforeseen situations.

**Explanation of Functions and Concepts:**

1.  **Art NFT Management:**
    *   `createArtProposal`:  Members can propose new art ideas with title, description, and IPFS hash (representing the artwork's metadata location on decentralized storage like IPFS). This initiates a governance process for art creation.
    *   `mintArtNFT`: Once an art proposal passes a vote, this function mints an NFT representing the digital artwork. The ownership is initially assigned to the smart contract itself, signifying collective ownership.
    *   `transferArtNFT`:  Allows transferring ownership of art NFTs. For NFTs owned by the collective (`artNFTOwnedByCollective`), it requires a governance proposal to ensure community approval before selling or transferring. For NFTs not owned by the collective (if such a feature was added), direct transfer might be possible.
    *   `getArtNFTMetadata`:  A simple getter to retrieve the metadata associated with an art NFT, allowing users to access information about the artwork.
    *   `burnArtNFT`: Allows for the destruction of an art NFT. This is a significant action and requires governance approval to prevent accidental or malicious deletion of valuable assets.

2.  **DAO Governance & Membership:**
    *   `applyForMembership`:  Users can apply to become members of the art collective by submitting an artist statement. This statement can be used for evaluation during the membership approval process.
    *   `approveMembership`: Existing members can propose and vote to approve new membership applications. This decentralized approval process ensures that new members are vetted by the community.
    *   `revokeMembership`: Members can propose and vote to revoke the membership of existing members. This provides a mechanism to maintain the quality and integrity of the collective.
    *   `depositGovernanceTokens`: Members can deposit governance tokens (in this example, using ETH for simplicity, but could be an ERC20 token) into the contract. This creates a treasury for the collective that can be used for various purposes.
    *   `withdrawGovernanceTokens`:  Withdrawals from the treasury are governed by proposals and voting. This ensures that treasury funds are used according to the collective's will.
    *   `proposeNewRule`: Members can propose new rules or changes to the collective's governance structure. This allows the DAO to evolve and adapt over time.
    *   `voteOnProposal`: Members can vote on any active proposals (art creation, membership, rules, treasury, etc.). The voting mechanism is a simple majority vote.
    *   `executeProposal`:  If a proposal passes the voting process (reaches quorum and majority), this function executes the action defined in the proposal. This is the function that actually implements the decisions made by the DAO.
    *   `getMemberCount`:  Returns the current number of members in the collective.
    *   `getProposalStatus`: Allows anyone to check the current status of a proposal (pending, active, passed, rejected, executed).

3.  **Collaborative Art Features:**
    *   `contributeToArt`:  Members can propose contributions to existing collectively owned art pieces. Contributions could be in the form of new metadata, variations of the artwork, or additions to the original piece. This function initiates a proposal for accepting a contribution.
    *   `createArtChallenge`: Members can create art challenges with specific themes, descriptions, start and end times. This encourages artistic creation within the collective around specific prompts.
    *   `submitArtForChallenge`: Members can submit their artwork to participate in active art challenges.
    *   `voteOnChallengeWinners`: After a challenge submission period ends, members can vote on the winning submissions. This provides a decentralized way to judge and reward art within the collective.
    *   `distributeChallengeRewards`: After the winner voting is complete and a proposal passes, this function distributes rewards (e.g., governance tokens, NFTs) to the winning artists.

4.  **Utility & Security Functions:**
    *   `getContractBalance`: Returns the current balance of governance tokens held by the contract, allowing for transparency and auditing of the treasury.
    *   `emergencyWithdraw`:  A function reserved for the contract owner to handle emergency situations (e.g., if there's a critical bug or security vulnerability). It allows for withdrawing funds to a safe address if necessary.

**Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

*   **Decentralized Governance:** The contract implements a basic DAO structure with proposals, voting, and execution, enabling community-driven decision-making for art creation, membership, and treasury management.
*   **Collective Art Ownership:**  Art NFTs minted through the collective are initially owned by the smart contract, representing shared ownership by the DAO.
*   **Collaborative Art & Challenges:**  The contract facilitates collaborative art creation through contribution proposals and art challenges, fostering community engagement and artistic growth.
*   **Dynamic Art (Potential Extension):**  While not fully implemented, the `contributeToArt` and `evolveArt` functions hint at the possibility of creating dynamic NFTs that can evolve and change based on community contributions and governance decisions.
*   **On-Chain Art Curation:**  The proposal and voting system acts as a decentralized curation mechanism, allowing the community to collectively decide which art pieces are officially recognized and minted by the collective.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Governance Token:** This contract uses ETH as a placeholder for governance tokens for deposit and withdrawal demonstration. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate an actual ERC20 governance token contract and use its `transferFrom` function for deposits and `transfer` for withdrawals.
*   **Voting Mechanism:** The voting mechanism is simplified (basic majority). For more robust DAOs, you might consider implementing more advanced voting systems like quadratic voting, weighted voting based on reputation, or delegated voting.
*   **Security:** This is a conceptual example. In a production environment, thorough security audits are crucial to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control, etc.).
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This contract is written for clarity and demonstration of features. Gas optimization techniques would be necessary for a real-world deployment to reduce transaction costs.
*   **Error Handling:**  `require()` statements are used for basic error handling. More detailed error messages and custom error types can be added for improved user experience and debugging.
*   **Scalability & Storage:**  For a large-scale art collective, consider using more efficient data structures and potentially off-chain storage solutions (like IPFS or Arweave) for art metadata and large files to manage gas costs and on-chain data limits.

This contract provides a foundation for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective. You can further expand and customize it based on specific requirements and creative ideas for your art community.
