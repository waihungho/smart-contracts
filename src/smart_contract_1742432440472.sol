 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - "ArtVerse DAO"
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, enabling artists to submit artworks,
 * curators to manage exhibitions, and users to engage with and purchase digital art.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1. `submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _price)`: Allows artists to submit their artwork to the gallery.
 * 2. `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an ERC721 NFT representing the approved artwork.
 * 3. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artwork NFTs directly from the gallery.
 * 4. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows artists to update the price of their artwork (before NFT minting).
 * 5. `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Allows artists to withdraw their earnings from artwork sales.
 * 6. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 7. `getArtistArtworks(address _artist)`: Retrieves a list of artwork IDs submitted by a specific artist.
 * 8. `getGalleryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the gallery contract.
 * 9. `withdrawGalleryFunds(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw funds (governance controlled in a real DAO).
 *
 * **Curatorial & Exhibition Management:**
 * 10. `proposeExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _exhibitionDescription)`: Allows curators to propose new exhibitions.
 * 11. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to add approved artworks to exhibitions.
 * 12. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to remove artworks from exhibitions.
 * 13. `startExhibitionVoting(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts a voting period for an exhibition proposal.
 * 14. `voteOnExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _approve)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 15. `finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Finalizes an exhibition proposal after voting, creating the exhibition if approved.
 * 16. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details about a specific exhibition.
 * 17. `getExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves a list of artwork IDs in a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **Governance & Community Features:**
 * 18. `createGovernanceToken(string _name, string _symbol, uint256 _initialSupply)`:  Deploys a basic governance token for the gallery DAO (for demonstration).
 * 19. `transferGovernanceToken(address _to, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows transferring governance tokens (basic token functionality).
 * 20. `setCurator(address _curator, bool _isActive)`: Allows the gallery owner to designate and manage curators.
 * 21. `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string _reportReason)`: Allows users to report potentially inappropriate or infringing artworks.
 * 22. `resolveArtworkReport(uint256 _artworkId, bool _removeArtwork)`: Allows curators to resolve artwork reports and potentially remove artworks.
 * 23. `burnGovernanceToken(uint256 _amount)`:  Allows burning of governance tokens (could be used for deflationary mechanisms).
 * 24. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`:  Allows setting the gallery's commission fee on artwork sales.
 * 25. `getGalleryFee()`: Returns the current gallery commission fee.
 * 26. `setRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Sets the royalty percentage for artists on secondary sales (implementation hint - not directly in this contract, usually handled by NFT standard or external marketplaces).
 * 27. `getRoyaltyPercentage()`: Retrieves the current royalty percentage.
 * 28. `pauseContract()`:  Allows the contract owner to pause core functionalities in case of emergency.
 * 29. `unpauseContract()`: Allows the contract owner to unpause the contract.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts Demonstrated:**
 * - **Decentralized Governance:**  Simulates basic DAO governance through exhibition voting (could be expanded).
 * - **NFT Integration (Conceptual):**  Demonstrates how to link artworks to NFTs and manage their lifecycle within the gallery.
 * - **Curated Art Platform:**  Implements a curatorial layer for quality control and exhibition management.
 * - **Artist Empowerment:**  Provides tools for artists to submit, price, and earn from their work.
 * - **Community Participation:**  Allows users to purchase art, report issues, and participate in governance (through voting).
 *
 * **Note:** This is a conceptual contract and would require further development for production use, including robust access control, detailed governance mechanisms,
 * error handling, gas optimization, and integration with a proper ERC721 NFT contract and marketplace ecosystem. Royalty implementation would typically be handled at the NFT level or within marketplace contracts.
