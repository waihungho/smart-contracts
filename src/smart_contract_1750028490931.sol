Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract that aims for creativity and advanced concepts by implementing a "Quantum Vault". This vault allows users to deposit various assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) and apply complex, time-based, conditional, or delegated access rules to *individual* holdings. It incorporates dynamic fees, batch operations, emergency escape hatches, and a simple internal state mechanism per holding.

It tries to avoid directly cloning standard open-source contracts (like a basic ERC20 vault, standard timelock, or generic escrow) by combining these concepts with per-holding state management, dynamic parameters, delegated access, and conditional releases triggered by external data (simulated oracle dependency).

## QuantumVault Smart Contract Outline

1.  **Introduction:** Purpose and core features.
2.  **State Variables:** Key data structures for holdings, configuration, fees, etc.
3.  **Enums & Structs:** Define types for asset types, holding details, etc.
4.  **Events:** Define events for logging significant actions.
5.  **Modifiers:** Define access control and state check modifiers.
6.  **Constructor:** Initialize the vault with owner and initial configuration.
7.  **Core Deposit Functions:**
    *   Deposit ETH, ERC20, ERC721.
    *   Handle fees and create unique holding entries.
8.  **Core Withdrawal Functions:**
    *   Withdraw ETH, ERC20, ERC721 from *eligible* holdings.
    *   Check lock status, conditions, and delegate permissions.
    *   Handle fees and update/remove holding entries.
9.  **Holding Management Functions:**
    *   Lock holdings (set time-based release).
    *   Set conditional release (dependent on external data/oracle).
    *   Cancel conditional release.
    *   Trigger conditional release (by oracle).
    *   Trigger internal holding state changes (based on time/conditions).
10. **Delegated Access Functions:**
    *   Grant temporary withdrawal permission for specific holdings to another address.
    *   Revoke delegated access.
11. **Batch Operations:**
    *   Deposit multiple ERC20 tokens/amounts in one transaction.
    *   Withdraw multiple ERC20 tokens/amounts in one transaction.

    *   Toggle allowed assets.
    *   Set oracle addresses.
    *   Collect accumulated fees.
    *   Update vault name.
    *   Initiate an emergency unlock (with delay).
    *   Cancel an emergency unlock.
13. **Query Functions (Read-Only):**
    *   Get user's total balance for an asset type.
    *   Get details of a specific holding.
    *   List holding IDs for a user.
    *   Check if a specific holding is locked or has a condition.
    *   Get current vault configuration.
    *   Check delegate access status.
    *   Get accumulated fees.

## QuantumVault Function Summary

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner and base configuration.
2.  `receive() external payable`: Allows receiving ETH deposits.
3.  `depositETH() payable`: Deposits sent ETH into the vault, creating a new holding entry.
4.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Deposits a specified amount of an ERC20 token, creating a new holding entry.
5.  `depositERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: Deposits a specific ERC721 token, creating a new holding entry.
6.  `withdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Withdraws an amount of ETH from the user's *unlocked* and *unconditional* holdings.
7.  `withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Withdraws an amount of an ERC20 token from the user's *unlocked* and *unconditional* holdings.
8.  `withdrawERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: Withdraws a specific ERC721 token if it is an *unlocked* and *unconditional* holding of the user.
9.  `lockHolding(uint256 holdingId, uint256 duration)`: Locks a specific holding for a set duration from the current time.
10. `unlockHolding(uint256 holdingId)`: Allows the user (or delegatee if permitted) to unlock a holding if its lock time has passed.
11. `setConditionalRelease(uint256 holdingId, address oracle, bytes calldata conditionData)`: Sets a condition (requiring oracle verification) for releasing a holding instead of a time lock.
12. `cancelConditionalRelease(uint256 holdingId)`: Cancels a previously set conditional release on a holding.
13. `triggerConditionalRelease(uint256 holdingId, bytes calldata proofData)`: Callable only by the designated oracle, verifies proof and releases the holding.
14. `triggerHoldingStateChange(uint256 holdingId)`: Advances the internal state of a holding based on contract logic (e.g., state changes after unlock).
15. `delegateTimedAccess(uint256 holdingId, address delegatee, uint256 duration)`: Grants temporary withdrawal permission for a holding to a specified address.
16. `revokeDelegateAccess(uint256 holdingId, address delegatee)`: Revokes delegate access for a specific holding and delegatee.
17. `batchDepositERC20(address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts)`: Deposits multiple types and amounts of ERC20 tokens in one transaction.
18. `batchWithdrawERC20(address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts)`: Withdraws multiple types and amounts of ERC20 tokens from unlocked holdings in one transaction.
19. `setFeeStructure(uint256 depositFeeBasisPoints, uint256 withdrawalFeeBasisPoints)`: Sets the percentages charged as fees for deposits and withdrawals (owner only).
20. `setMinMaxLockDurations(uint256 minDuration, uint256 maxDuration)`: Sets the acceptable range for lock durations (owner only).
21. `setAllowedAsset(address assetAddress, bool allowed)`: Whitelists or blacklists specific asset contract addresses for deposits (owner only).
22. `setOracleAddress(address oracleAddress)`: Sets the authorized address for triggering conditional releases (owner only).
23. `collectFees(address token)`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated fees for a specific token (or ETH).
24. `updateVaultName(string memory newName)`: Updates the public name of the vault (owner only).
25. `initiateEmergencyUnlock(uint256 holdingId, uint256 delay)`: Starts a timed delay for emergency unlocking a holding (owner only, with delay for user to potentially react).
26. `cancelEmergencyUnlock(uint256 holdingId)`: Cancels a pending emergency unlock (owner or original owner can do this).
27. `getUserTotalBalance(address user, AssetType assetType, address assetAddress)`: Gets the total aggregated balance/count for a specific asset type and address for a user across all their holdings.
28. `getHoldingDetails(uint256 holdingId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific holding.
29. `getUserHoldingsList(address user)`: Returns a list of `holdingId`s belonging to a user.

    // - Batch operations (batchDepositERC20, batchWithdrawERC20)
    // - Emergency escape hatch (initiateEmergencyUnlock, cancelEmergencyUnlock)
    // - Internal holding state counter (internalStateCounter)
    // - Consolidated withdrawals for fungible tokens (_withdraw helper)

**Explanation of Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Per-Holding State Management:** Instead of just tracking a user's total balance, the contract treats each deposit (or each ERC721) as a distinct "holding" with its own `Holding` struct. This struct tracks its owner, asset details, deposit time, *and crucially*, its `state` and specific lock/condition parameters (`lockEndTime`, `conditionalReleaseOracle`, `conditionalReleaseData`). This granular control is more complex than standard vaults.
2.  **Flexible Access Control:** Holdings can be:
    *   `ACTIVE`: Immediately withdrawable by owner.
    *   `LOCKED`: Time-locked, only withdrawable after `lockEndTime`.
    *   `CONDITIONAL`: Requires an authorized `oracle` to call `triggerConditionalRelease`. This allows linking release to off-chain events or complex on-chain conditions verified by the oracle.
    *   `DELEGATED`: A specific delegatee has temporary permission to *unlock* (but not necessarily withdraw) the holding. This adds a layer of access management beyond simple ownership.
    *   `EMERGENCY_UNLOCK_PENDING`: Initiated by the owner, enters a state where the holding can be unlocked after a predefined delay, bypassing original conditions/time locks if necessary (e.g., if an oracle is down).
    *   `UNLOCKED`: The time lock expired or condition was met, ready for withdrawal.
    *   `WITHDRAWN`: The holding has been released.
3.  **Dynamic Configuration:** Fees (`depositFeeBasisPoints`, `withdrawalFeeBasisPoints`) and lock durations (`minLockDuration`, `maxLockDuration`) are not fixed constants but stored in a `VaultConfig` struct and can be updated by the owner. This makes the vault adaptable.
4.  **Conditional Release (Oracle Dependency):** The `setConditionalRelease` and `triggerConditionalRelease` functions introduce a dependency on an external oracle (specified by `vaultConfig.authorizedOracle`). This allows use cases where assets are released only after, for example, a sports game result, a real-world event, or verification of credentials via the oracle. The `proofData` is a placeholder for how the oracle proves the condition was met.
5.  **Delegated Timed Access:** `delegateTimedAccess` is an advanced feature allowing a user to grant temporary, limited access to *just unlock* a specific holding to someone else. This could be used for collaborative vault management or specific dApp interactions.
6.  **Internal Holding State:** The `internalStateCounter` in the `Holding` struct is a simple mechanism allowing potential future logic to depend on the history or state progression of an individual holding. It could be used for reputation, tiering, or triggering effects specific to that deposited item.
7.  **Emergency Unlock:** Provides a controlled escape hatch if conditions cannot be met or time locks become problematic, but includes a delay to prevent immediate rug pulls by the owner against locked user funds.
8.  **Batch Operations:** `batchDepositERC20` and `batchWithdrawERC20` improve user experience and potentially save gas by bundling multiple token interactions into one transaction (though gas cost increases with array size).
9.  **Handling Fungible vs. Non-Fungible:** The contract correctly distinguishes between ETH/ERC20 (where amounts are consolidated) and ERC721 (where specific tokenIds are managed individually) for deposits and withdrawals. The `_withdraw` helper specifically addresses the complexity of drawing specific amounts from potentially fragmented fungible holdings.

This contract is more complex than a simple vault and demonstrates how Solidity can be used to build intricate financial or asset management systems with novel rules and state transitions per individual asset unit stored within the contract. It incorporates several "trendy" concepts like dynamic fees, conditional access, and delegated permissions in a combined structure.
