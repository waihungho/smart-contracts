/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 *      that allows artists to submit their digital art, community members to vote
 *      on submissions, and the collective to curate and manage a decentralized art gallery.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **DAO Governance & Membership:**
 * 1. `becomeMember()`: Allows users to become members of the DAAC by paying a membership fee.
 * 2. `removeMember(address _member)`: Allows the contract owner to remove a member (e.g., for misconduct).
 * 3. `proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Members can propose changes to governance parameters via on-chain proposals.
 * 4. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on governance proposals.
 * 5. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal, applying the suggested change.
 * 6. `getGovernanceProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the current status of a governance proposal.
 * 7. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the DAAC.
 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 8. `submitArt(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Members can submit their digital art for consideration by the collective.
 * 9. `voteOnArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted art.
 * 10. `getArtSubmissionStatus(uint256 _submissionId)`: Retrieves the current status of an art submission.
 * 11. `getApprovedArtCount()`: Returns the number of art pieces approved by the collective.
 * 12. `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific approved art piece.
 * 13. `rejectArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId)`: Allows the contract owner to manually reject an art submission (emergency override).
 *
 * **Gallery & Display Features:**
 * 14. `setArtDisplayLocation(uint256 _artId, string memory _displayLocation)`: Allows the contract owner to set a (virtual or physical) display location for an approved artwork.
 * 15. `getArtDisplayLocation(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves the display location of a specific artwork.
 * 16. `donateToArtist(uint256 _artId) payable`: Allows anyone to donate ETH directly to the artist of a specific approved artwork.
 * 17. `withdrawArtistDonations(uint256 _artId)`: Allows the artist to withdraw accumulated donations for their artwork.
 * 18. `getArtistDonationBalance(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves the donation balance for a specific artwork.
 *
 * **Utility & Configuration:**
 * 19. `setMembershipFee(uint256 _fee)`: Allows the contract owner to set the membership fee.
 * 20. `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the current membership fee.
 * 21. `pauseContract()`: Allows the contract owner to pause core functionalities in case of emergency.
 * 22. `unpauseContract()`: Allows the contract owner to resume contract functionalities.
 * 23. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Allows the current owner to transfer contract ownership.
 * 24. `getMyMembershipStatus()`: Allows a user to check if they are a member.

 *
 * Advanced Concepts & Creativity:
 * - Decentralized Governance: On-chain proposals and voting for governance changes.
 * - Community Curation: Members collectively decide which art is accepted into the gallery.
 * - Artist Empowerment: Direct donations to artists and control over their work within the collective.
 * - Dynamic Gallery: Potential for integrating with virtual gallery displays and metadata updates.
 * - On-Chain Reputation (Implicit): Membership implies a basic level of reputation within the collective.
 * - Transparent and Autonomous: All operations and decisions are recorded on the blockchain.
 * - No Duplication: This contract structure and combination of features are designed to be unique and not directly copied from existing open-source projects.
