Okay, let's create a complex, feature-rich smart contract called "QuantumVault". This contract allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens and lock them under highly customizable, multi-conditional, and time-dependent terms for themselves or other recipients. The "Quantum" aspect comes from the idea that unlocking requires a confluence of different, potentially independent, conditions to align â€“ a form of "state collapse" or fulfilling multiple requirements simultaneously.

It will incorporate:
1.  **Multi-conditional Release:** Unlocking requires satisfying a combination of time, external data, multi-party confirmations, Merkle proof verification, and/or specific interaction triggers.
2.  **Time Dynamics:** Time locks, expiration, and potentially time-based penalties.
3.  **Multi-Party Aspects:** Multiple recipients, multi-sig style confirmation requirements.
4.  **External Interaction Simulation:** Conditions dependent on external data (simulated oracle) or specific off-chain/other-contract interactions (simulated trigger).
5.  **Proof-based Release:** Unlocking can require providing a valid Merkle proof.
6.  **Complex State Management:** Tracking individual lock states, condition statuses, and confirmations.
7.  **Cancellation & Reclaiming:** Mechanisms for locker to cancel early (with penalty) or reclaim if conditions are never met/lock expires.

## QuantumVault Smart Contract

**Purpose:** A secure vault for locking ERC20 tokens based on complex, multi-faceted, time-dependent, and conditional criteria. Unlocking requires fulfilling a combination of predefined conditions.

**Outline:**
1.  **Imports:** ERC20 standard, utility libraries (SafeERC20, Ownable, Pausable).
2.  **Errors:** Custom errors for clarity.
3.  **Events:** To signal key actions (Lock Created, Unlocked, Cancelled, Condition Met, etc.).
4.  **Structs:** `QuantumLock` to define the parameters and state of each locked position.
5.  **State Variables:** Mappings for locks, user lock IDs, global parameters (oracle address, Merkle root, penalty rate), counters.
6.  **Modifiers:** Standard `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, custom condition-check helpers.
7.  **Constructor:** Initializes the token address and ownership.
8.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   Deposit tokens.
    *   Create a new Quantum Lock with various conditions.
    *   Check the current unlock status of a lock (view).
    *   Attempt to execute an unlock, verifying all conditions.
9.  **Condition Management:**
    *   Setting global external data parameters (by Oracle role).
    *   Setting global Merkle root (by Oracle/Owner role).
    *   Submitting Merkle proof for a specific lock/recipient.
    *   Submitting multi-sig confirmations by recipients.
    *   Triggering a specific interaction condition flag.
    *   Checking status of specific conditions (views).
10. **Lock Management:**
    *   Retrieving lock details (view).
    *   Getting locks associated with a user (view).
    *   Locker initiating early cancellation.
    *   Locker withdrawing tokens after cancellation or expiration/failure.
11. **Admin/Utility:**
    *   Pause/Unpause contract.
    *   Set various trusted addresses (Oracle, Interaction Trigger).
    *   Set penalty rates.
    *   Check contract token balance (view).
    *   Ownership management.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address tokenAddress)`: Initializes contract, sets the ERC20 token, and sets deployer as owner.
2.  `pause()`: Pauses the contract, preventing state-changing actions (Owner only).
3.  `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract (Owner only).
4.  `deposit(uint256 amount)`: User deposits ERC20 tokens into the vault (requires token approval).
5.  `createQuantumLock(address[] recipients, uint256 amount, uint64 endTime, uint256 requiredExternalDataValue, uint256 requiredConfirmations, bytes32 requiredMerkleLeaf, bool requiresSpecificInteraction, bool requiresExternalData, bool requiresMultiSig, bool requiresMerkleProof, bool requiresSpecificInteraction)`: Creates a new lock with the specified parameters and conditions. Transfers `amount` from locker to contract.
6.  `checkLockStatus(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Checks if *all* required conditions for a lock are currently met based on the current global state and individual lock state. Returns `true` if unlockable, `false` otherwise.
7.  `attemptUnlock(uint256 lockId)`: Attempts to unlock a lock. Requires `msg.sender` to be one of the recipients. Calls `checkLockStatus`. If true, transfers the recipient's share of tokens and updates lock state.
8.  `getLockDetails(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Returns all stored details for a given lock ID.
9.  `getUserLockIds(address user)`: View function. Returns an array of lock IDs associated with the given user (as locker or recipient).
10. `cancelLockByLocker(uint256 lockId)`: Allows the original locker to initiate cancellation *before* the `endTime`. Marks lock as cancelled and available for withdrawal (subject to penalty).
11. `withdrawCancelledTokens(uint256 lockId)`: Allows the original locker to withdraw tokens from a lock previously marked as cancelled. Calculates and applies the early cancellation penalty.
12. `reclaimExpiredLock(uint256 lockId)`: Allows the original locker to reclaim tokens from a lock whose `endTime` has passed *without* successfully being unlocked by any recipient.
13. `setOracleAddress(address _oracleAddress)`: Owner sets the trusted address for providing external data and Merkle roots.
14. `updateExternalDataValue(uint256 _newValue)`: Only the Oracle address can call this to update the global `currentExternalDataValue`.
15. `setMerkleRoot(bytes32 _newRoot)`: Only the Oracle address (or Owner) can call this to update the global `currentMerkleRoot` for Merkle proof conditions.
16. `provideMerkleProof(uint256 lockId, bytes32[] calldata proof)`: Allows a recipient of a lock requiring Merkle proof to submit their proof. Verifies the proof against the `currentMerkleRoot` and the `requiredMerkleLeaf` stored in the lock. Sets a flag on the lock indicating proof provided for this recipient.
17. `setInteractionTriggerAddress(address _triggerAddress)`: Owner sets the trusted address that can signal specific interaction conditions.
18. `triggerSpecificInteractionCondition(uint256 lockId)`: Only the Interaction Trigger address can call this to mark the `specificInteractionConditionMet` flag for a given lock.
19. `confirmMultiSigCondition(uint256 lockId)`: Allows a recipient of a lock requiring multi-sig to submit their confirmation. Increments the confirmation count for that lock.
20. `isMultiSigConditionMet(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Checks if the required number of multi-sig confirmations has been reached for a lock.
21. `getPendingMultiSigConfirmations(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Returns the number of confirmations still needed for a lock's multi-sig condition.
22. `setEarlyCancellationPenaltyRate(uint256 rateInBasisPoints)`: Owner sets the penalty rate for early cancellation (e.g., 500 for 5%).
23. `calculateCancellationPenalty(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Calculates the potential penalty amount if the locker were to cancel the specified lock now.
24. `getVaultBalance()`: View function. Returns the contract's current balance of the locked ERC20 token.
25. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of the contract (Owner only).
26. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces ownership of the contract (Owner only).
27. `getRecipientUnlockAmount(uint256 lockId)`: View function. Calculates the amount each recipient is due upon successful unlock, based on the total lock amount and number of recipients.
28. `checkMerkleProofProvided(uint256 lockId, address recipient)`: View function. Checks if the Merkle proof condition has been successfully fulfilled by a specific recipient for a lock.
