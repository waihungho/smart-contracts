Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced and non-standard concepts: a "Quantum Vault". This vault will hold assets (ETH or ERC-20s) that are locked until a set of "quantum conditions" are met and a "measurement" is triggered. The outcome of the measurement, which determines if the assets can be fully withdrawn, will have a probabilistic element influenced by the met conditions and a simulated random factor, mimicking the idea of state collapse and non-determinism in quantum mechanics (purely metaphorical, of course, as blockchains are deterministic).

It will include features like:
*   Multi-asset support (ETH and specific ERC-20s).
*   Dynamic conditions that can be added to a vault.
*   Condition types based on time, oracle data, or the state of *other* vaults ("simulated entanglement").
*   A "measurement" function that evaluates conditions and triggers a probabilistic outcome.
*   Configurable probability weights for outcomes based on conditions.
*   Fees for operations.
*   Emergency withdrawal with penalty.
*   Ownership management for both the contract and individual vaults.

**Disclaimer:** The "quantum" aspect is a metaphor applied to conditional and probabilistic logic. The randomness source used (`block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty`) in this example is **NOT secure or decentralized** and should never be used for high-value contracts. A real-world implementation would require a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) like Chainlink VRF. This code is for educational and creative demonstration purposes.

## Smart Contract: QuantumVault

### Outline

1.  **Contract Setup:**
    *   Pragma, Imports (`Ownable`, `Pausable`, `IERC20`).
    *   Custom Errors for clearer error handling.
    *   Enums for Vault States, Condition Types, Condition States.
    *   Structs for `QuantumCondition` and `Vault`.
2.  **State Variables:**
    *   Mappings for storing vaults, conditions, and user-to-vault IDs.
    *   Counters for unique IDs.
    *   Configuration variables (fees, addresses, allowed tokens, probability weights).
3.  **Events:** To signal key actions (Vault Created, Measurement Triggered, Outcome Determined, Withdrawal, etc.).
4.  **Modifiers:** For access control and state checks.
5.  **Constructor:** Initialize contract owner and fee address.
6.  **Owner/Admin Functions (Inherited + Custom):**
    *   `transferOwnership`, `renounceOwnership` (from Ownable).
    *   `pause`, `unpause` (from Pausable).
    *   `setOracleAddress`: Set address for external data source.
    *   `addAllowedToken`: Whitelist ERC-20 tokens.
    *   `removeAllowedToken`: Remove ERC-20 tokens from whitelist.
    *   `setFeeAddress`: Set the address to receive fees/penalties.
    *   `setMeasurementFee`: Configure the fee for triggering measurement.
    *   `setEmergencyWithdrawalFee`: Configure the penalty fee for emergency withdrawal.
    *   `setProbabilityWeights`: Adjust parameters influencing probabilistic outcomes.
7.  **Vault Management Functions:**
    *   `createVault`: Create a new vault with initial assets and conditions.
    *   `addConditionToVault`: Add a new condition to an existing vault.
    *   `removeConditionFromVault`: Remove a condition from a vault.
    *   `transferVaultOwnership`: Transfer vault control to another address.
    *   `depositIntoVault`: Add more assets to an existing vault.
    *   `removeVault`: Clean up a zero-balance vault in a final state.
8.  **Core Logic Functions:**
    *   `triggerMeasurement`: Execute the core "measurement" logic, evaluate conditions, determine outcome probabilistically.
9.  **Withdrawal/Outcome Functions:**
    *   `withdrawAssets`: Allow withdrawal after a successful measurement.
    *   `emergencyWithdraw`: Allow withdrawal with penalty in the locked state.
    *   `claimFees`: Allow the fee address to collect accumulated fees/penalties.
10. **Internal Helper Functions:**
    *   `_evaluateCondition`: Logic to check if a specific condition is met.
    *   `_determineOutcome`: Logic to use condition results and randomness to decide the final state.
    *   `_chargeFee`: Handle fee payment.
    *   `_performWithdrawal`: Handle asset transfer out of the contract.
11. **View Functions (Read-only):**
    *   `getVaultDetails`: Retrieve data for a specific vault.
    *   `getUserVaults`: List vault IDs owned by an address.
    *   `getConditionDetails`: Retrieve data for a specific condition.
    *   `getAllowedTokens`: List whitelisted tokens.
    *   `getContractBalance`: Check the contract's token balance.
    *   `getMeasurementFee`, `getEmergencyWithdrawalFee`, `getProbabilityWeights`, `getFeeAddress`, `getOracleAddress`: Retrieve configuration.

### Function Summary (Highlighting Executable/State-Changing Functions)

Here are the functions, focusing on those that change the contract state, bringing us to the target of 20+ executable functions:

1.  `constructor(address initialFeeAddress)`: Initializes the contract, sets the initial owner (deployer) and fee address.
2.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: (Inherited) Transfers contract ownership.
3.  `renounceOwnership()`: (Inherited) Renounces contract ownership.
4.  `pause()`: (Inherited) Pauses the contract, restricting most functions.
5.  `unpause()`: (Inherited) Unpauses the contract.
6.  `setOracleAddress(address _oracleAddress)`: Sets the address of the external oracle used for `OracleValue` conditions. (Owner only)
7.  `addAllowedToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Adds an ERC-20 token to the list of accepted deposit tokens. (Owner only)
8.  `removeAllowedToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Removes an ERC-20 token from the whitelist. (Owner only)
9.  `setFeeAddress(address _feeAddress)`: Sets the address where fees and penalties are sent. (Owner only)
10. `setMeasurementFee(uint256 _feeAmount)`: Sets the fee required to trigger a vault measurement. (Owner only)
11. `setEmergencyWithdrawalFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Sets the percentage penalty for emergency withdrawals (e.g., 10 for 10%). (Owner only)
12. `setProbabilityWeights(uint256 _baseSuccessWeight, uint256[] memory _conditionTypeWeights)`: Configures weights used in the probabilistic outcome determination. (Owner only)

14. `addConditionToVault(uint256 vaultId, QuantumCondition memory condition)`: Adds a new condition to an existing vault, only allowed in `Locked` state. (Vault owner)
15. `removeConditionFromVault(uint256 vaultId, uint256 conditionId)`: Removes a condition from a vault, only allowed in `Locked` state. (Vault owner)
16. `transferVaultOwnership(uint256 vaultId, address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of a specific vault to another address. (Vault owner, only in `Locked` state)
17. `depositIntoVault(uint256 vaultId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Adds more assets of the same token type to an existing vault, only allowed in `Locked` state. Requires asset transfer. (Vault owner)
18. `triggerMeasurement(uint256 vaultId)`: Initiates the "measurement" process for a vault. Evaluates conditions, applies probabilistic outcome determination based on conditions and randomness. Requires a fee. Can only be called on a vault in the `Locked` state. (Anyone)
19. `withdrawAssets(uint256 vaultId)`: Allows the vault owner to withdraw assets from a vault that reached the `Measured_Success` state. Transitions vault to `Closed`. (Vault owner)
20. `emergencyWithdraw(uint256 vaultId)`: Allows the vault owner to withdraw assets from a vault in the `Locked` state with a significant penalty. Transitions vault to `EmergencyWithdrawn`. (Vault owner)
21. `claimFees()`: Allows the configured fee address to withdraw all accumulated fees and penalties. (Fee address)
22. `removeVault(uint256 vaultId)`: Removes a vault struct and associated data from storage if it's in a final state (`Closed` or `EmergencyWithdrawn`) and has zero balance, helping save gas/storage. (Vault owner)

This list provides 22 state-changing functions, meeting the requirement of at least 20.
