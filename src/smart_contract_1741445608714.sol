/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI (Conceptual Design)
 * @dev This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, incorporating advanced concepts
 *      like curated NFT exhibitions, dynamic pricing based on community sentiment, artist royalties,
 *      fractional NFT ownership, community governance, and more. It aims to be a comprehensive and
 *      innovative platform for digital art within a decentralized ecosystem.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I. Core Functionality (NFT & Gallery Management):**
 *    1. `mintArtPiece(string memory _tokenURI, address[] memory _collaborators, uint256[] memory _collaboratorShares)`: Allows artists to mint new art pieces (NFTs) with optional collaborator support and royalty splitting.
 *    2. `listArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: Allows the art piece owner to list their NFT for sale in the gallery at a specified price.
 *    3. `delistArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the art piece owner to delist their NFT from sale in the gallery.
 *    4. `buyArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows anyone to purchase a listed art piece.
 *    5. `transferArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`: Allows the art piece owner to transfer ownership of their NFT. (Standard ERC721 extension)
 *    6. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Gallery owner function to set the platform fee percentage for sales.
 *    7. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Gallery owner function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 *    8. `getArtPieceDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`: View function to retrieve detailed information about an art piece (price, artist, collaborators, etc.).
 *
 * **II. Curated Exhibitions & Dynamic Pricing:**
 *    9. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows curators to propose and create new art exhibitions with a name and time frame.
 *    10. `proposeArtForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows art piece owners to propose their NFTs for inclusion in a specific exhibition.
 *    11. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId, bool _approve)`: Curator function to vote on proposed art pieces for an exhibition.
 *    12. `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curator or Gallery owner function to officially start an exhibition, making approved art pieces visible in the exhibition.
 *    13. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curator or Gallery owner function to end an exhibition.
 *    14. `adjustPriceBasedOnSentiment(uint256 _tokenId, int256 _sentimentScore)`:  Function to dynamically adjust the price of an art piece based on community sentiment (external oracle/aggregator input - placeholder for advanced integration).
 *
 * **III. Fractional NFT Ownership & Governance (DAO Elements):**
 *    15. `fractionalizeArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Allows the owner of an art piece to fractionalize it into a specified number of fungible tokens (ERC20).
 *    16. `redeemFractionalOwnership(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Allows holders of fractional tokens to redeem them to potentially trigger a collective ownership event or governance process related to the NFT (placeholder for advanced DAO features).
 *    17. `proposeGalleryParameterChange(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)`:  Allows fractional NFT holders (or designated DAO members - concept for advanced governance) to propose changes to gallery parameters (e.g., fee percentage, voting thresholds).
 *    18. `voteOnParameterChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`:  Fractional NFT holders (or designated DAO members) to vote on proposed gallery parameter changes.
 *
 * **IV. Artist Royalties & Community Features:**
 *    19. `setArtistRoyalty(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Allows the original artist to set a secondary sale royalty percentage for their art piece.
 *    20. `withdrawArtistRoyalties(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows artists to withdraw accumulated royalties from secondary sales of their art.
 *    21. `reportArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _reportReason)`:  Allows community members to report potentially inappropriate or infringing art pieces (placeholder for moderation/governance features).
 *    22. `tipArtist(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows users to tip the artist of an art piece as a form of appreciation (community engagement).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Collaborative Minting and Royalty Splitting:**  The `mintArtPiece` function allows artists to specify collaborators and their respective revenue shares at the time of minting. This is a more advanced feature than typical single-artist NFT minting, enabling built-in royalty splits for collaborations.

2.  **Curated Exhibitions:** The contract introduces the concept of curated exhibitions. Curators (represented by a designated address in this example, but could be a more complex role management system in a real DAO) can create exhibitions, and artists can propose their NFTs for inclusion. Curators then vote on the proposed art pieces, adding a layer of curation and thematic organization to the gallery.

3.  **Dynamic Pricing based on Sentiment (Conceptual):** The `adjustPriceBasedOnSentiment` function is a placeholder for a trendy and advanced concept. It *conceptually* demonstrates how an art piece's price could be dynamically adjusted based on community sentiment. In a real-world application, this would require integration with external oracles or sentiment analysis services to feed in sentiment scores. This function showcases the potential for smart contracts to react to external real-world data.

4.  **Fractional NFT Ownership (Conceptual DAO Element):** The `fractionalizeArtPiece` and `redeemFractionalOwnership` functions are placeholders for fractional NFT ownership. This is a highly advanced and trendy concept.  In a real implementation, this would involve creating ERC20 tokens representing fractions of an NFT, locking the NFT, and implementing governance mechanisms for fractional owners. This contract provides the *conceptual* functions and events to illustrate this advanced idea, but would need significant expansion for a full implementation.

5.  **DAO-like Governance for Gallery Parameters:** The `proposeGalleryParameterChange`, `voteOnParameterChange`, and `finalizeParameterChangeProposal` functions introduce a basic DAO governance mechanism.  Fractional NFT holders (or a defined DAO membership) could propose and vote on changes to gallery parameters like the platform fee. This is a simplified governance model, but illustrates the integration of DAO principles into the art gallery.

6.  **Artist Royalties on Secondary Sales:** The `setArtistRoyalty` and `withdrawArtistRoyalties` functions implement standard artist royalties on secondary sales, ensuring artists continue to benefit from their work even after the initial sale.

7.  **Community Reporting and Tipping:** The `reportArtPiece` and `tipArtist` functions introduce community engagement features. Reporting allows for community moderation (conceptually), and tipping allows users to directly support artists they appreciate.

8.  **Exhibition Timelines and Management:** The exhibition functions (`createExhibition`, `startExhibition`, `endExhibition`) manage exhibition lifecycles with start and end times, adding a time-bound element to art displays.

9.  **Collaborator Revenue Sharing:** The `mintArtPiece` function's collaborator feature ensures that revenue from sales can be automatically split with collaborators based on pre-defined shares, simplifying revenue distribution for collaborative art.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Conceptual and Placeholder:**  Many of the advanced features, especially fractionalization, sentiment-based pricing, and DAO governance, are presented as *conceptual* implementations. A real-world, production-ready contract would require significantly more complex logic, security considerations, and integration with external systems (like oracles for sentiment data and ERC20 token contracts for fractionalization).
*   **Security:** This code is for illustrative purposes and has not undergone rigorous security audits. In a production environment, thorough security audits and best practices for smart contract development are essential.
*   **Curator Role:** The `curatorRoleAddress` is a placeholder for a more sophisticated curator role management system. In a real DAO or gallery, curator roles would likely be managed through a more robust access control mechanism or DAO governance.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This contract is designed for functionality and demonstration of concepts, not for extreme gas optimization. Gas optimization would be a crucial consideration for a production deployment.
*   **Error Handling:** The contract includes basic `require` statements for error handling. More comprehensive error handling and event logging would be beneficial in a real-world application.

This contract provides a foundation and inspiration for building a truly advanced and innovative decentralized art gallery platform on the blockchain, incorporating trendy and creative features beyond basic NFT marketplaces. Remember to expand upon these concepts and thoroughly test and secure any smart contract before deploying it to a live network.
