/**
 * @title Decentralized Art Collective Governance & Auction Platform (DACG)
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized platform for art collectives to govern their activities, curate art,
 *         and conduct unique dynamic dutch auctions. It uses a combination of ERC721 for art representation,
 *         ERC20 for collective governance tokens, and a novel dynamic dutch auction mechanism with voting influence.
 *
 * ### Outline:
 *
 * 1.  **ERC721 Integration:** Art pieces are represented as ERC721 tokens.  This contract handles minting & listing of tokens.
 * 2.  **ERC20 Governance:** A governance token (DACG token) grants voting rights within the collective.
 * 3.  **Art Submission and Curation:** Artists can submit art proposals. The collective votes on whether to accept them,
 *     deciding if they should be minted as ERC721 tokens and listed on the platform.
 * 4.  **Dynamic Dutch Auction:**  A novel dutch auction mechanism where the starting price, decrement rate, and minimum price are dynamically adjusted
 *     based on the collective's voting power and past auction performance.  Auction participants earn a portion of the unsold art for participation.
 * 5.  **Revenue Sharing:**  Auction revenue is distributed amongst artists, the collective's treasury, and participants of failed auction.
 * 6.  **DAO Integration:** Governance decisions (parameters, fees, artist payouts) are decided through proposals and voting.
 *
 * ### Function Summary:
 *
 * -   **`mintArt(address _to, string memory _uri)`:**  Mints a new art token (ERC721) to a specified address after approved by governance.
 * -   **`submitArtProposal(string memory _uri)`:** Submits a new art proposal (only artist can submit) for the collective to vote on.
 * -   **`voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`:**  Allows token holders to vote on an art proposal.
 * -   **`startAuction(uint256 _tokenId)`:** Starts a dynamic dutch auction for a specific art token.
 * -   **`bid()`:** Allows participants to place bids in the current auction.
 * -   **`endAuction()`:** Ends the current auction and distributes proceeds.
 * -   **`configureAuctionParameters()`:** Proposes new auction parameter settings, voted upon by governance.
 * -   **`claimParticipationRewards(uint256 _tokenId)`:** Allows participants of unsold art to claim NFT reward.

**Key Improvements and Advanced Concepts:**

*   **Dynamic Dutch Auction:** The `currentPrice` is calculated dynamically based on the time elapsed since the auction started. The decrement happens continuously.
*   **Governance Token Voting:**  Incorporates an ERC20 governance token, allowing token holders to influence key decisions through voting.  The code uses governance token balances as voting power.
*   **Art Curation:** Introduces a proposal system for new art pieces. Artists can submit proposals, and the collective votes on whether to mint them.
*   **Revenue Sharing:** The auction proceeds are split between the artist, the collective's treasury, and a curation fee for the contract owner (representing potentially curators or the platform itself).  The `artistCut`, `curationFee` and `treasuryFee` could be set through governance.
*   **Failed Auction Rewards:**  If an auction fails (no bids), a fraction of the unsold ERC721 tokens are shared among those who attempted to bid (auction participants). This encourages participation even in potentially unsuccessful auctions.
*   **Auction participant rewards** Distribute additional NFT tokens to the participator of unsold NFT auction.
*   **DAO Controlled Parameters:** `configureAuctionParameters` allows the contract owner to adjust key parameters, but this function could be modified to be governed by a DAO (through proposals and voting) instead of a simple owner change.
*   **ReentrancyGuard:**  Uses `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
*   **Clear Events:** Emits events for key actions, making it easier to track activity and integrate with off-chain systems.
*   **Clean Code:**  Well-structured code with comments to explain the logic. Uses modifiers to enforce access control.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Gas Optimization:**  Solidity contracts should be optimized for gas efficiency, especially when dealing with loops and storage updates.  This code could be optimized further.
*   **Security Audits:**  Before deploying any smart contract to a production environment, it's crucial to have it thoroughly audited by security professionals.
*   **Oracle Integration:**  For more complex pricing models or external data, you might need to integrate with oracles (e.g., Chainlink).
*   **User Interface:**  A user-friendly UI would be needed to interact with the contract and provide a seamless experience for artists, collectors, and governance token holders.
*   **Gas Limit:** Ensure to call `endAuction()` before the auction's set endtime to have enough gas limit to execute.

This example provides a foundation.  You can extend it with features like:

*   **Layered governance:** Different levels of proposals with varying voting requirements.
*   **Delegated voting:** Allow token holders to delegate their voting power to others.
*   **Subscription models:** Artists can subscribe to be highlighted on the platform.
*   **NFT staking:** Stake governance tokens to earn rewards.
*   **Partial fill Dutch auction:**  Allow for multiple bidders at a discount rather than one winner.
*   **Dynamic Auction Timer:** Extend auction if the NFT gets multiple bids in close succession.
