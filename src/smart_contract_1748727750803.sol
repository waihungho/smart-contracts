Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a Decentralized AI Art Commissioning and Marketplace, incorporating various advanced and creative concepts beyond a standard NFT market.

This contract allows users to:
1.  Commission unique AI art pieces by providing prompts and parameters.
2.  Artists (approved via governance) to fulfill these commissions by generating art off-chain and submitting the result (metadata hash).
3.  Mint the resulting art as dynamic NFTs upon commission acceptance.
4.  Buy and sell these dynamic AI art NFTs on a decentralized marketplace within the contract.
5.  Artists to set custom royalties on their creations.
6.  Govern the platform via staking and voting on proposals (like approving new artists, changing fees, etc.).
7.  Potentially update the metadata of dynamic NFTs via a controlled process (e.g., artist submitting a new version, requiring governance approval or a time-lock).

It includes concepts like:
*   AI Commission Workflow (request, claim, fulfill, accept/reject)
*   Dynamic NFTs (controlled metadata updates)
*   On-chain Marketplace
*   Custom Royalties (ERC2981 style, though implemented manually for simplicity and integration)
*   Staking for Governance Power
*   Decentralized Governance (Proposals, Voting, Execution)
*   Role Management (Approved Artists)
*   Handling Ether payments and splits (requester to artist, royalty, platform fee)
*   Integration points for off-chain AI generation and decentralized storage (via metadata hashes).

// --- Function Summary ---
// Core Marketplace:
// 1. listArtworkForSale(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price): Lists owned artwork for sale.
// 2. buyArtwork(uint256 tokenId): Purchases listed artwork.
// 3. getArtworkDetails(uint256 artworkId): Retrieves artwork details by internal ID.
// 4. getArtworkDetailsByTokenId(uint256 tokenId): Retrieves artwork details by ERC721 token ID.
// 5. getOwnedArtworks(address owner): Returns a list of artwork IDs owned by an address.

// 9. fulfillCommission(uint256 commissionId, string memory fulfilledMetadataHash): Artist submits the result of a claimed commission.
// 10. acceptCommissionFulfillment(uint256 commissionId): Requester accepts the fulfilled artwork, triggering NFT minting and payment distribution.
// 11. rejectCommissionFulfillment(uint256 commissionId, string memory reason): Requester rejects the fulfilled artwork, potentially refunding budget.

// Staking:
// 24. stakeTokensForVotingPower(uint256 amount): Stakes platform tokens to gain voting power. (Assumes a separate platform token contract)
// 25. unstakeTokens(uint256 amount): Unstakes tokens, reducing voting power.
// 26. getVotingPower(address user): Returns the current voting power of a user.

// Platform Admin/Config:
// 27. withdrawPlatformFees(): Owner/Admin can withdraw accumulated platform fees (consider migrating to governance).
// 28. setCustomArtworkRoyalty(uint256 artworkId, uint96 royaltyBps): Artist sets a custom royalty percentage for their specific artwork. (Clapped by maxRoyaltyBps)

// Dynamic Artwork:
// 29. proposeArtworkMetadataUpdate(uint256 artworkId, string memory newMetadataHash): Proposes an update to an artwork's metadata hash (requires governance vote or specific criteria).

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **AI Commissioning Workflow:** The contract orchestrates a multi-step process (`request`, `claim`, `fulfill`, `accept/reject`) involving different user roles (requester, artist), managed entirely on-chain. The actual AI generation is off-chain, but the contract tracks its progress via status changes and the final metadata hash submission.
2.  **Dynamic NFTs:** The `updateArtworkMetadataUpdate` proposal type and `executeArtworkMetadataUpdate` function allow the linked metadata (and thus potentially the visual representation) of an already minted NFT to be changed *after* creation. This is controlled via governance, preventing arbitrary changes and providing a transparent history. This moves beyond static NFTs.
3.  **Decentralized Governance:** The contract implements a basic governance system where token holders (via `stakeTokensForVotingPower`) can propose and vote on changes (like approving artists, changing fees, updating dynamic art metadata). This shifts control away from a single owner towards the community.
4.  **Staking for Voting Power:** Governance power is directly tied to staking a hypothetical `platformToken`. This incentivizes holding the platform token and gives active participants influence.
5.  **Role Management (Approved Artists):** Artists aren't automatically allowed to fulfill commissions or withdraw earnings; they must be approved, and this approval process is managed via the governance system (`applyAsArtist` creates a proposal, `approveArtist` is the execution target).
6.  **Integrated Marketplace & Royalties:** It combines a standard marketplace buy/sell flow with automatic royalty distribution (based on a per-artwork or default rate) and platform fee collection during sales. The royalty logic is integrated directly into the `buyArtwork` function, adhering to an ERC2981-like concept without full interface implementation.
7.  **On-chain State for Off-chain Assets:** The contract manages IPFS/Arweave hashes (`metadataHash`, `fulfilledMetadataHash`) which represent the actual artwork files stored off-chain. The contract is the immutable link establishing ownership and provenance for these off-chain assets.
8.  **Fund Distribution Logic:** Handles splitting received Ether payments (from commissions and sales) between the artist, the platform treasury, and potentially royalties to the *original* artist if the seller is different. Funds are held in the contract balance and distributed or recorded in artist earnings balances.

This contract provides a framework for a complex decentralized application, demonstrating interaction between on-chain logic and off-chain processes (AI generation, storage) and implementing community-driven control over key platform parameters and assets. It's significantly more complex than a simple ERC721 or fixed-price marketplace.
