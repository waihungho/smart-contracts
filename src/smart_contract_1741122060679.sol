 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAArtGallery)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like dynamic NFT metadata,
 *      algorithmic curation, decentralized governance, and community-driven features.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Concepts:**
 * - **Dynamic NFT Metadata:** Art NFTs can have metadata that evolves based on on-chain events (e.g., popularity, owner history).
 * - **Algorithmic Curation:**  A smart contract-driven curation system based on a customizable algorithm, moving beyond simple voting.
 * - **Decentralized Governance (Limited):**  Token holders can influence aspects of the gallery, like curation algorithm parameters.
 * - **Community Engagement:** Features for artists and collectors to interact, collaborate, and contribute to the gallery's ecosystem.
 * - **On-Chain Reputation System:**  A basic reputation system for artists and collectors within the gallery.
 *
 * **Function Summary (20+ Functions):**
 *
 * **Art NFT Management:**
 * 1. `submitArt(string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Artists submit their artwork (NFT metadata IPFS hash).
 * 2. `mintArtNFT(uint256 _artId)`: Mints an ERC721 NFT for approved and curated artwork.
 * 3. `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 4. `updateArtMetadata(uint256 _artId, string memory _newIpfsHash)`: Artists can update metadata of their unminted submitted artwork.
 * 5. `reportArt(uint256 _artId, string memory _reportReason)`: Users can report artworks for policy violations.
 * 6. `resolveArtReport(uint256 _artId, bool _isOffensive)`: Admin/Curators resolve reported artworks (potentially remove from gallery).
 * 7. `getArtistArtworks(address _artistAddress)`: Retrieve a list of artworks submitted by a specific artist.
 *
 * **Curation and Exhibition:**
 * 8. `setCurationAlgorithmParameter(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _value)`: Admin/Governance can adjust parameters of the curation algorithm.
 * 9. `getCurationScore(uint256 _artId)`: Calculates the curation score for an artwork based on the algorithm.
 * 10. `triggerCurationProcess()`: Initiates the algorithmic curation process to select artworks for exhibition.
 * 11. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Admin/Curators create a new art exhibition.
 * 12. `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Add curated artworks to a specific exhibition.
 * 13. `getActiveExhibitions()`: Retrieves a list of currently active exhibitions.
 * 14. `getExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves artworks included in a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **Community and Reputation:**
 * 15. `likeArt(uint256 _artId)`: Users can "like" an artwork, influencing its popularity and curation score.
 * 16. `followArtist(address _artistAddress)`: Users can "follow" artists to stay updated on their submissions.
 * 17. `getArtistFollowersCount(address _artistAddress)`: Get the number of followers for an artist (basic reputation metric).
 * 18. `getArtLikesCount(uint256 _artId)`: Get the number of likes for an artwork (basic popularity metric).
 * 19. `contributeToGalleryFund()`: Users can contribute ETH to a gallery fund (for future development, artist rewards, etc.).
 * 20. `withdrawGalleryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Admin can withdraw funds from the gallery fund (governance controlled in a real-world scenario).
 * 21. `setGalleryName(string memory _name)`: Admin can set the name of the art gallery.
 * 22. `getGalleryName()`: Retrieves the name of the art gallery.
 *
 * **Admin/Governance (Basic):**
 * 23. `setAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Change the contract administrator.
 * 24. `pauseContract()` / `unpauseContract()`:  Circuit breaker for emergency situations.
