This contract, named "Axiom Collective," introduces a novel concept: a decentralized, adaptive strategy engine that autonomously manages a shared treasury based on collectively vetted "strategies" and real-world performance feedback. It aims to create a dynamic, self-improving system where the best strategists and validators are rewarded, and the collective's actions adapt over time.

---

## **Axiom Collective: Decentralized Adaptive Strategy Engine**

### **Outline & Function Summary**

The Axiom Collective is designed to manage a shared treasury (e.g., in ETH or a stablecoin) by autonomously executing strategies proposed by "Strategists" and vetted by "Validators." It incorporates a reputation system, dynamic adaptation, and external data integration via oracles.

#### **I. Core System Setup & Control**
1.  **`constructor(address _initialOwner, address _oracleAddress, uint256 _epochDuration, uint256 _minStakeForStrategy, uint256 _reputationDecayRate)`**: Initializes the contract with an owner, oracle address, epoch duration, minimum stake for strategy submission, and reputation decay rate.
2.  **`setOracleAddress(address _newOracleAddress)`**: Allows the owner to update the address of the external oracle.
3.  **`setEpochDuration(uint256 _newEpochDuration)`**: Allows the owner to adjust the duration of each strategy evaluation epoch.
4.  **`setMinStakeForStrategy(uint256 _newMinStake)`**: Sets the minimum amount of ETH required to stake when submitting a new strategy.
5.  **`setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _newRate)`**: Configures how quickly user reputation decays over time if not actively participating.
6.  **`emergencyPause()`**: Allows the owner to pause critical functions in case of an emergency or vulnerability.
7.  **`unpause()`**: Allows the owner to unpause the contract after an emergency.
8.  **`transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`**: Transfers ownership of the contract.

#### **II. Strategy Lifecycle Management**
9.  **`submitStrategy(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier, string calldata _description, bytes calldata _executionParameters, uint256 _expectedOutcomeValue)`**: Allows a user to propose a new strategy, requiring a minimum stake. `_strategyIdentifier` could be a hash of off-chain logic, `_executionParameters` define on-chain actions/targets, and `_expectedOutcomeValue` is a prediction for later validation.
10. **`stakeForStrategy(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier)`**: Users can stake ETH to endorse a proposed strategy within the current voting epoch, increasing its validation score.
11. **`challengeStrategy(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier)`**: Users can stake ETH to challenge a proposed strategy, decreasing its validation score.
12. **`withdrawStrategyStake(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier)`**: Allows users to withdraw their staked ETH from an unfinalized strategy.
13. **`updateStrategyParameters(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier, bytes calldata _newExecutionParameters, uint256 _newExpectedOutcomeValue)`**: Allows the original strategist to update parameters for their *unfinalized* strategy, useful for fine-tuning.

#### **III. Epoch Progression & Execution**
14. **`executeEpochStrategy()`**: A permissionless function (callable by anyone) that advances the epoch if the duration has passed. It calculates the optimal strategy based on validation scores and strategists' reputation, then attempts to execute it. This is the core "adaptive intelligence" function.
15. **`reportExternalOutcome(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier, uint256 _actualOutcomeValue, string calldata _outcomeDetails)`**: An oracle-only function (or trusted reporter) that provides the actual outcome of a previously executed strategy. This feedback is crucial for reputation updates and future strategy selection.

#### **IV. Reputation & Rewards**
16. **`claimReputationReward()`**: Allows users to claim accumulated reputation points or associated token rewards based on their successful contributions (strategizing or validating).
17. **`slashReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`**: Internal function, called by the system (e.g., after `reportExternalOutcome`) to reduce a user's reputation for poor strategy performance or incorrect validation.
18. **`queryUserReputation(address _user)`**: Returns the current reputation score of a specific user.

#### **V. Treasury Management**
19. **`depositToTreasury()`**: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective's treasury.
20. **`withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount)`**: Allows withdrawal from the treasury *only if* the currently active strategy explicitly permits it, or if it's part of a "governance" action triggered by the execution of a high-reputation, treasury-management strategy.

#### **VI. Advanced & Query Functions**
21. **`delegateStakeToStrategist(address _strategistAddress)`**: Allows a user to delegate their future strategy validation stake to a specific strategist, effectively pooling their influence.
22. **`revokeDelegation()`**: Revokes any active delegation.
23. **`getEpochSummary(uint256 _epochId)`**: Retrieves details about a specific historical epoch, including the selected strategy and its outcome.
24. **`getCurrentActiveStrategy()`**: Returns details about the strategy that was selected and executed in the current or most recent epoch.
25. **`getStrategyDetails(bytes32 _strategyIdentifier)`**: Retrieves all available details for a specific strategy by its identifier.
