Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept I've designed called "QuantumVault". It explores the idea of deposits existing in a probabilistic state until a "measurement" event collapses them into a definite outcome, affecting the final withdrawn amount. This uses concepts inspired by quantum mechanics (superposition, measurement, entanglement - in a highly simplified and analogous way within the contract's logic) to create a unique deposit and retrieval mechanism.

**Disclaimer:** The "randomness" source used in this example (`block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty`, `block.number`, `keccak256`) is **highly insecure and predictable** for real-world applications. For any production system requiring secure unpredictability, a dedicated oracle like Chainlink VRF should be used. This contract is for demonstrating a conceptual idea.

## QuantumVault Smart Contract Outline and Function Summary

**Concept:**
The QuantumVault allows users to deposit Ether or ERC20 tokens. Unlike a traditional vault, these deposits initially exist in a "Probabilistic" state, analogous to quantum superposition. The final amount a user can withdraw is determined by a "Measurement" event, which collapses the probabilistic state into a single, definite "Quantum Outcome". The outcome logic is configurable by the owner (or potentially via governance in a more complex version). The contract also introduces a simplified "Entanglement" concept where the measurement of one deposit can trigger or influence the measurement of another linked deposit.

**Key States:**
1.  **Probabilistic:** The deposit is made but its final value outcome is uncertain.
2.  **Measured:** The measurement event has occurred, and the final `measuredOutcome` is determined.
3.  **Withdrawn:** The user has withdrawn assets based on the `measuredOutcome`.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Probabilistic Deposit:** Funds are held in a state where the potential withdrawal amount is one of several possibilities.
*   **Measurement:** A specific action (triggered manually or perhaps by time) that uses a source of unpredictability to determine the final state/outcome for a deposit.
*   **Quantum Outcome:** The determined final state after measurement, dictating the actual amount available for withdrawal (e.g., original amount * 0.5, * 1.0, * 1.5, etc.).
*   **Entanglement (Simulated):** Linking two deposits such that they share a dependency, often related to their measurement or outcome.

**Outline:**

1.  **Enums:** Define states (`DepositState`, `QuantumOutcome`).
2.  **Structs:** Define `Deposit` structure to hold deposit details.
3.  **State Variables:** Owner, deposit counter, mappings for deposits, user deposit IDs, outcome parameters, entanglement mapping.
4.  **Events:** For deposit, measurement, withdrawal, entanglement, parameter changes.
5.  **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `whenProbabilistic`, `whenMeasured`, `whenNotWithdrawn`.
6.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   Deposit Ether/Tokens.
    *   Trigger Measurement for a deposit.
    *   Perform Measurement (internal logic).
    *   Withdraw based on measured outcome.
7.  **Advanced/Creative Functionality:**
    *   Entangle two deposits.
    *   Break entanglement.
    *   Predict outcome hint (simulated).
    *   Set/Configure outcome probabilities/logic (Owner).
    *   Batch measure deposits.
    *   Conditional transfer based on outcome.
    *   Cancel probabilistic deposit (with fee).
    *   Audit specific measurement result.
    *   Simulate potential outcomes (view).
8.  **Utility/View Functions:** Get deposit details, user balances (probabilistic/measured), total supply (probabilistic/measured), eligible deposits for measurement.
9.  **Owner Functions:** Set parameters, withdraw trapped funds (emergency).
10. **ERC20 Interaction:** Handling token deposits and withdrawals.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

1.  `depositEther()`: Deposit Ether into the vault in a probabilistic state.
2.  `depositToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault in a probabilistic state.
3.  `triggerMeasurement(uint256 depositId)`: Initiates the measurement process for a specific probabilistic deposit.
4.  `performMeasurement(uint256 depositId, bytes32 randomnessSeed)`: Internal function to calculate and set the `measuredOutcome` based on the seed. *Uses insecure randomness for demonstration.*
5.  `withdraw(uint256 depositId)`: Withdraws the assets for a `Measured` deposit based on its `measuredOutcome`.
6.  `withdrawAllMeasuredEther()`: Withdraws all Ether from all `Measured` deposits belonging to the caller.
7.  `withdrawAllMeasuredTokens(address tokenAddress)`: Withdraws all tokens of a specific type from all `Measured` deposits belonging to the caller.
8.  `entangleDeposits(uint256 depositId1, uint256 depositId2)`: Links two probabilistic deposits. Measurement of one *can* potentially trigger or influence the other.
9.  `breakEntanglement(uint256 depositId)`: Removes a deposit's entanglement link.
10. `predictOutcomeHint(uint256 depositId)`: Provides a non-binding, simulated hint of a possible outcome based on current parameters, without performing actual measurement.
11. `setOutcomeProbabilities(uint16[] calldata probabilities)`: (Owner) Sets the weights/probabilities for different `QuantumOutcome` possibilities. Must sum to 10000 (for fixed point 100.00%).
12. `setOutcomeMultipliers(QuantumOutcome[] calldata outcomes, uint256[] calldata multipliers)`: (Owner) Sets the multipliers (e.g., 0.5x, 1.0x, 1.5x) associated with each `QuantumOutcome`. Multipliers are fixed-point (e.g., 15000 for 1.5x).
13. `batchMeasureDeposits(uint256[] calldata depositIds)`: (Owner/Authorized) Triggers measurement for multiple deposits.
14. `setupConditionalTransfer(uint256 depositId, QuantumOutcome requiredOutcome, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Sets up a transfer that will execute *only* if the deposit's measured outcome matches `requiredOutcome`.
15. `executeConditionalTransfer(uint256 depositId)`: Executes a pre-setup conditional transfer if the conditions are met (deposit measured, outcome matches).
16. `cancelProbabilisticDeposit(uint256 depositId)`: Allows the user to withdraw a probabilistic deposit *before* measurement, potentially incurring a fee.
17. `auditMeasurementResult(uint256 depositId, bytes32 usedSeed)`: View function to verify if the provided seed would result in the stored `measuredOutcome` based on the *current* outcome logic. Useful for auditing past measurements.
18. `simulateMeasurementOutcome(bytes32 randomnessSeed)`: View function to show which `QuantumOutcome` would result from a specific seed based on current parameters.
19. `getUserDepositIds(address user)`: Returns an array of deposit IDs owned by a specific user.
20. `getDepositDetails(uint256 depositId)`: Returns the full details of a specific deposit struct.
21. `getUserProbabilisticBalance(address user, address tokenAddress)`: Calculates the total value of deposits in the `Probabilistic` state for a user and token type.
22. `getUserMeasuredBalance(address user, address tokenAddress)`: Calculates the potential withdrawal value of deposits in the `Measured` state for a user and token type, summing based on their outcomes.
23. `getTotalProbabilisticSupply(address tokenAddress)`: Gets the total value of deposits in the `Probabilistic` state for a token type across all users.
24. `getTotalMeasuredSupply(address tokenAddress)`: Gets the total value of deposits in the `Measured` state for a token type across all users, summing based on their outcomes.
25. `renounceOwnership()`: Standard OpenZeppelin function.
26. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard OpenZeppelin function.
