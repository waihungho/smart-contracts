Here's a smart contract written in Solidity, incorporating advanced, creative, and trendy concepts, with at least 20 functions. This contract aims to build a **"Synthetica Knowledge Hub"** â€“ a decentralized platform for sharing, curating, and funding knowledge artifacts, integrating dynamic Soulbound Reputation NFTs (SBTs), AI oracle-assisted content assessment, knowledge bounties, and DAO-like governance.

    // --- Outline and Function Summary ---
    //
    // This contract, SyntheticaKnowledgeHub, acts as a decentralized platform for sharing,
    // curating, and funding knowledge artifacts. It introduces several advanced concepts:
    //
    // 1.  **Dynamic Soulbound Reputation NFTs (SBTs):** User reputation is tied to a
    //     non-transferable NFT which dynamically updates its visual representation (via URI)
    //     and internal score based on on-chain actions (contributions, curation, accurate flags).
    // 2.  **AI Oracle Integration:** Leverages an off-chain AI model (via an oracle contract)
    //     to assist in content categorization, quality scoring, and spam detection.
    // 3.  **Reputation-Weighted Curation:** Voting power on artifacts and proposals is
    //     scaled by a user's reputation score, promoting informed governance.
    // 4.  **Knowledge Bounties:** A mechanism for users to crowdfund and incentivize
    //     the creation of specific knowledge artifacts.
    // 5.  **Simplified DAO Governance:** Basic proposal and voting system for key
    //     contract parameters or fund allocations, using reputation-weighted votes.
    //
    // Functions are grouped by their primary purpose:
    //
    // **I. Core Infrastructure & Configuration (Owner/Admin controlled)**
    // 1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract, sets the owner, and initial parameters.
    // 2.  `setAIDecisionOracle`: Sets the address of the trusted AI oracle contract.
    // 3.  `setReputationNFTContract`: Sets the address of the Synthetica Reputation NFT contract.
    // 4.  `setSubmissionFee`: Sets the fee required to submit a new knowledge artifact.
    // 5.  `setVoteWeightMultiplier`: Adjusts the impact of reputation score on vote power.
    // 6.  `setMinReputationForProposal`: Sets the minimum reputation score required to create a governance proposal.
    // 7.  `pauseContract`: Emergency function to pause critical contract operations.
    // 8.  `unpauseContract`: Unpauses the contract after an emergency.
    // 9.  `withdrawFunds`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated contract funds (e.g., submission fees).
    //
    // **II. Knowledge Artifact Management**
    // 10. `submitArtifact`: Allows users to submit a new knowledge artifact (IPFS hash, metadataURI, initial tags). Requires a fee.
    // 11. `getArtifactDetails`: Retrieves the comprehensive details of a specific knowledge artifact.
    // 12. `updateArtifactMetadata`: Allows the original contributor to update the artifact's non-critical metadata URI.
    // 13. `flagArtifact`: Allows users to flag an artifact for review (e.g., spam, incorrect information).
    // 14. `resolveFlag`: Allows high-reputation users or owner to resolve a flagged artifact, potentially deactivating it.
    //
    // **III. Curation & Voting**
    // 15. `upvoteArtifact`: Casts an upvote for an artifact, with vote weight scaled by the user's reputation.
    // 16. `downvoteArtifact`: Casts a downvote for an artifact, with vote weight scaled by the user's reputation.
    // 17. `addTagsToArtifact`: Proposes new tags for an artifact; high-reputation users can confirm.
    // 18. `removeTagsFromArtifact`: Proposes removal of tags from an artifact; high-reputation users can confirm.
    // 19. `getArtifactVotes`: Retrieves the current upvote and downvote counts for an artifact.
    //
    // **IV. Reputation & Rewards (Interacting with SBT-NFT)**
    // 20. `requestReputationEvaluation`: Triggers an evaluation of the caller's reputation score based on recent actions, and updates their SBT.
    // 21. `claimReward`: Allows users to claim their accumulated rewards earned from contributing and curating.
    // 22. `getContributorRewardBalance`: Returns the current pending reward balance for a specific contributor.
    // 23. `getReputationLevelForUser`: Retrieves the reputation score (level) for a given user from the associated NFT contract.
    //
    // **V. AI Oracle Integration**
    // 24. `receiveAIDecision`: A trusted function for the AI oracle to submit its analysis (score, tags) for an artifact.
    // 25. `getAIDecisionForArtifact`: Retrieves the AI-generated decision (score and tags) for an artifact.
    // 26. `verifyAIDecisionAccuracy`: Allows high-reputation users to verify the accuracy of an AI oracle's decision, impacting oracle's future trust.
    //
    // **VI. Knowledge Bounties & Governance**
    // 27. `createKnowledgeBounty`: Creates a new bounty for specific knowledge, funded by the creator.
    // 28. `submitBountySolution`: Submits an existing artifact as a solution to an open bounty.
    // 29. `voteOnBountySolution`: Allows users to vote on proposed solutions for a bounty (reputation-weighted).
    // 30. `awardBounty`: Awards the bounty to the winning artifact/contributor, distributing the reward.
    // 31. `createGovernanceProposal`: Allows high-reputation users to propose changes to contract parameters.
    // 32. `voteOnGovernanceProposal`: Allows users to vote on active governance proposals (reputation-weighted, time-locked).
    // 33. `executeGovernanceProposal`: Executes a passed governance proposal.
