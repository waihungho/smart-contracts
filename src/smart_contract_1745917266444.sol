Okay, let's create a smart contract with an interesting, advanced concept. We'll build a "Quantum Vault" – a contract that holds Ether and ERC20 tokens, with complex access control based on time, specific beneficiaries, and a simulated "quantum fluctuation" event that affects withdrawal conditions and fees. The "quantum" aspect will be a probabilistic state change influenced by on-chain pseudo-randomness (like block properties).

This contract will feature:

1.  **Multi-asset holding:** Stores ETH and specified ERC20 tokens.
2.  **State Machine:** The vault can be in different states (`Locked`, `Schrodingers`, `Unlocking`, `Paused`).
3.  **Time-Based Unlock:** A primary unlock condition is a time duration.
4.  **Beneficiary System:** Only designated addresses can withdraw.
5.  **Simulated Quantum Fluctuation:** A periodic, pseudo-random event affects withdrawal terms (e.g., changes fees, enables/disables certain withdrawals).
6.  **Schrödinger's State:** A special state where the vault's *true* unlock status is uncertain until an "observation" function is called, which triggers the probabilistic outcome.
7.  **Dynamic Fees:** Withdrawal fees can vary based on the vault state and fluctuation status.
8.  **Granular Control:** Owner can manage beneficiaries, tokens, unlock durations, and fluctuation parameters.

*   **State Variables:** Owner, vault state, balances (ETH, ERC20), beneficiary list, unlock time, lock duration, fee parameters, fluctuation parameters, allowed tokens, pause status.
*   **Enums:** `VaultState` (Locked, Schrodingers, Unlocking, Paused).
*   **Events:** `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`, `StateChange`, `BeneficiaryAdded`, `BeneficiaryRemoved`, `FluctuationDetected`, `ObservationTriggered`, `FeeCollected`.
*   **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`.
*   **Constructor:** Sets the owner.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Core Vault Management:** Deposit (ETH/Tokens), Withdrawal (ETH/Tokens - conditional), Set/Extend Lock Duration, Get Unlock Time, Get Vault State, Set Vault State, Pause/Unpause Vault, Is Vault Paused.
    *   **Beneficiary Management:** Add/Remove Beneficiary, Check if Beneficiary, Get All Beneficiaries.
    *   **Asset Management:** Add/Remove Allowed Tokens, Check if Token Allowed, Get Deposited Amounts (ETH/Tokens).
    *   **Quantum/Fluctuation Logic:** Trigger Schrödinger's Observation, Is Fluctuation Active, Get Fluctuation Intensity, Set Fluctuation Parameters, Get Fluctuation Parameters.
    *   **Fee Management:** Get Current Withdrawal Fee (Calculation), Collect Fees (ETH/Tokens).
    *   **Owner/Admin:** Transfer Ownership, Renounce Ownership, Get Owner.

**Function Summary (Total: 33 functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Deploys the contract and sets the initial owner.
2.  `depositETH()`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the vault.
3.  `depositToken(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone to deposit allowed ERC20 tokens. Requires prior approval.
4.  `withdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Allows a beneficiary to withdraw ETH based on vault state, time lock, and fluctuation conditions, applying potential fees.
5.  `withdrawToken(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows a beneficiary to withdraw ERC20 tokens based on vault state, time lock, and fluctuation conditions, applying potential fees.
6.  `addBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`: Owner adds an address allowed to potentially withdraw.
7.  `removeBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`: Owner removes an address from the beneficiary list.
8.  `isBeneficiary(address account)`: Checks if an address is currently a beneficiary.
9.  `getBeneficiaries()`: Returns the list of all beneficiaries.
10. `setVaultLockDuration(uint256 durationSeconds)`: Owner sets or resets the duration the vault remains locked from the moment it enters the `Locked` or `Schrodingers` state.
11. `extendVaultLockDuration(uint256 additionalSeconds)`: Owner adds time to the current lock duration.
12. `getVaultUnlockTime()`: Calculates and returns the specific timestamp when the vault is scheduled to unlock from `Locked` or `Unlocking` state.
13. `setVaultState(VaultState newState)`: Owner transitions the vault to a different state (`Locked`, `Schrodingers`, `Unlocking`, `Paused`). Requires specific conditions for certain transitions.
14. `getVaultState()`: Returns the current state of the vault.
15. `triggerSchrodingersObservation()`: Callable by anyone when the vault is in `Schrodingers` state. Uses block data to probabilistically transition the vault to `Unlocking` or keep it in `Schrodingers`.
16. `isFluctuationActive()`: Checks if the simulated "quantum fluctuation" is currently active based on block data and parameters.
17. `getFluctuationIntensity()`: Returns a calculated intensity value (0-100) of the fluctuation if active, based on block data.
18. `setFluctuationParameters(uint256 observationChanceNumerator, uint256 observationChanceDenominator, uint256 intensityFactor)`: Owner sets parameters controlling the `Schrodingers` observation chance and fluctuation intensity calculation.
19. `getFluctuationParameters()`: Returns the current fluctuation parameters.
20. `getWithdrawalFee(uint256 amount)`: Calculates the potential fee for withdrawing a given amount based on the current vault state and fluctuation intensity.
21. `collectFeesETH()`: Owner withdraws accumulated ETH fees.
22. `collectFeesToken(address token)`: Owner withdraws accumulated ERC20 fees for a specific token.
23. `getDepositedETH(address account)`: Returns the ETH balance deposited by a specific account.
24. `getDepositedToken(address account, address token)`: Returns the balance of a specific token deposited by an account.
25. `getVaultTotalETH()`: Returns the total ETH balance held in the vault.
26. `getVaultTotalToken(address token)`: Returns the total balance of a specific token held in the vault.
27. `addAllowedToken(address token)`: Owner adds an ERC20 token address to the list of allowed deposit tokens.
28. `removeAllowedToken(address token)`: Owner removes an ERC20 token address from the allowed list.
29. `isTokenAllowed(address token)`: Checks if an ERC20 token address is allowed for deposits.
30. `pauseVault()`: Owner can pause withdrawals and state transitions in case of emergency.
31. `unpauseVault()`: Owner unpauses the vault.
32. `isVaultPaused()`: Checks if the vault is currently paused.
33. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
34. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces contract ownership (makes it unowned).
