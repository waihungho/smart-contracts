 * 3. revokeMembership(address _member): Admin function to revoke an existing membership.
 * 4. proposeGovernanceChange(string _proposalDescription, bytes _proposalData): Members can propose changes to the DAAC governance.
 * 5. voteOnGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members can vote on active governance proposals.
 * 6. executeGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId): Admin function to execute a passed governance proposal.
 * 7. setQuorum(uint _newQuorum): Admin function to change the voting quorum for governance proposals.

 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 9. submitArt(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint _requiredVotes): Members can submit their art for consideration.
 * 10. voteOnArtSubmission(uint _submissionId, bool _vote): Members can vote on pending art submissions.
 * 11. finalizeArtSubmission(uint _submissionId): Admin function to finalize an art submission after voting.
 * 12. rejectArtSubmission(uint _submissionId): Admin function to reject an art submission.
 * 13. createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint[] _artIds): Admin function to create a curated exhibition.
 * 14. addArtToExhibition(uint _exhibitionId, uint[] _artIds): Admin function to add art to an existing exhibition.
 * 15. removeArtFromExhibition(uint _exhibitionId, uint[] _artIds): Admin function to remove art from an exhibition.
