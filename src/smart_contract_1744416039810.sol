 * 11. getApprovedSubmissions(): Retrieves a list of IDs of approved art submissions.
 * 12. getPendingSubmissions(): Retrieves a list of IDs of submissions currently under voting.
 *
 * --- Collective Gallery & Sales ---
 * 13. createCollectiveNFT(uint256 _submissionId): Creates a Collective NFT representing an approved art piece, minted to the submitter.

**Explanation of Functions and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **`constructor(string _collectiveName, address _governanceTokenAddress)`:**
    *   **Initialization:** Sets up the contract with a name and the address of a governance token. This shows the integration with external tokens for governance.

2.  **`setVotingDuration(uint256 _duration)` and `setSubmissionFee(uint256 _fee)`:**
    *   **Admin Controls:**  Standard admin functions to configure key parameters of the DAAC.

3.  **`withdrawContractBalance()`:**
    *   **Admin Utility:** Allows the admin to withdraw accumulated ETH, likely from submission fees or potentially platform revenue in a more complex model.

4.  **`setCuratorRewardPercentage(uint256 _percentage)` and `setGovernanceTokenRewardPercentage(uint256 _percentage)`:**
    *   **Revenue Sharing:**  Introduces the concept of distributing revenue from NFT sales to curators (voters) and governance token holders, incentivizing participation and governance.

5.  **`submitArtPiece(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`:**
    *   **Art Submission:**  Allows users to submit art pieces with metadata (title, description, IPFS hash for the actual artwork).  The `submissionFee` enforces a barrier to entry and potentially funds the platform.

6.  **`voteOnArtPiece(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`:**
    *   **Decentralized Voting:** Governance token holders can vote on submitted art pieces. This is a core DAO concept, using token holders for decision-making.
    *   **Modifier `isGovernanceTokenHolder`:**  Placeholder modifier. In a real application, this would interact with the ERC20 governance token contract to verify token ownership, showcasing interoperability between contracts.

7.  **`endVotingForSubmission(uint256 _submissionId)`:**
    *   **Voting Outcome Logic:**  Ends the voting period and determines if an art piece is approved based on a simple majority vote.  This function is crucial for automating the decision-making process.

8.  **`getSubmissionDetails(uint256 _submissionId)`, `getApprovedSubmissions()`, `getPendingSubmissions()`:**
    *   **Data Retrieval:**  Functions to query submission data, allowing users and external interfaces to access information about the art submission process.

9.  **`createCollectiveNFT(uint256 _submissionId)`:**
    *   **NFT Minting:**  If an art piece is approved, the submitter can mint a "Collective NFT" representing their artwork being accepted into the DAAC gallery. This is a key aspect of leveraging NFTs in a collective context.

10. **`listCollectiveNFTForSale(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`:**
    *   **Decentralized Marketplace:**  NFT owners can list their Collective NFTs for sale directly within the contract. This creates a basic decentralized marketplace for the collective's art.

11. **`purchaseCollectiveNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`:**
    *   **NFT Purchase & Revenue Distribution:** Allows users to purchase listed NFTs.  Critically, this function implements the revenue distribution logic, sending a portion of the sale price to the seller, curators, and governance token holders. This demonstrates a simple economic model within the DAAC.

12. **`removeCollectiveNFTFromSale(uint256 _tokenId)`:**
    *   **Marketplace Management:**  Allows sellers to delist their NFTs from the marketplace.

13. **`getListingDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`, `getGalleryNFTs()`:**
    *   **Marketplace Data Retrieval:** Functions to query NFT listing information and get a list of all NFTs in the gallery.

14. **`claimCuratorRewards()` and `claimGovernanceTokenRewards()`:**
    *   **Reward Claiming (Simplified):**  Simplified functions for curators and governance token holders to claim their share of revenue. In a real system, reward distribution would be more sophisticated (e.g., tracking individual curator votes and governance token holdings).

15. **`getVotingPower(address _voter)`:**
    *   **Voting Power Calculation (Placeholder):**  A placeholder function for determining voting power. In a real DAAC, voting power would likely be proportional to the amount of governance tokens held or staked, demonstrating a more robust governance mechanism.

16. **`getContractBalance()`, `getCollectiveName()`:**
    *   **Utility/Information Functions:**  Basic functions to get contract status and information.

**Advanced Concepts Demonstrated:**

*   **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Principles:** The contract incorporates core DAO concepts like governance through token holders, voting mechanisms, and automated decision-making.
*   **NFT Integration:** Uses NFTs to represent collective art pieces and create a marketplace, showcasing the utility of NFTs beyond simple collectibles.
*   **Revenue Sharing & Tokenomics:**  Implements a basic economic model by distributing revenue to different stakeholders (artists, curators, governance token holders), incentivizing participation.
*   **On-Chain Governance:**  Voting logic is implemented on-chain, making the governance process transparent and verifiable.
*   **Interoperability (Placeholder):** The `governanceTokenAddress` and `isGovernanceTokenHolder` modifier hint at the ability to interact with external ERC20 token contracts for more advanced governance.
*   **State Machine (Implicit):** The art submission and voting process can be seen as a simple state machine, transitioning from submission to voting to approval/rejection.

**Creativity and Trendiness:**

*   **Art Collective Theme:**  The concept of a decentralized art collective is inherently creative and aligns with the growing interest in NFTs and digital art.
*   **Community-Driven Curation:**  The voting mechanism allows the community to curate the art gallery, making it a truly collective effort.
*   **Decentralized Marketplace:**  Building a marketplace directly into the contract is a trendy approach in the DeFi and NFT space, enabling direct peer-to-peer trading within the DAAC ecosystem.

**Important Notes & Potential Improvements:**

*   **Simplified Rewards:** The reward distribution and claiming mechanisms are intentionally simplified for this example. In a production DAAC, these would need to be much more robust and fair.
*   **Governance Token Interaction:** The governance token logic is a placeholder. Real integration with an ERC20 token contract would require more complex interactions (e.g., querying balances, potentially using safe transfer functions).
*   **Curator Tracking:**  The "curator rewards" are very basic. A real system would need to track who voted correctly on approved submissions to distribute rewards fairly to actual curators.
*   **Scalability & Gas Optimization:**  This contract is a conceptual example.  For a real-world DAAC, careful attention would need to be paid to gas optimization and scalability, especially as the number of submissions and NFTs grows.
*   **Off-Chain IPFS Handling:** The contract stores IPFS hashes.  A real application would need to handle the retrieval and display of art from IPFS in a user-friendly way (likely off-chain).
*   **More Sophisticated Voting:**  Consider more advanced voting mechanisms like quadratic voting, ranked-choice voting, or delegated voting for a more robust governance system.
*   **NFT Metadata:**  The `createCollectiveNFT` function is basic. In a real NFT implementation, you would want to generate rich metadata for the NFTs (including links to IPFS content, submission details, etc.) and potentially use standards like ERC721 or ERC1155 for better NFT compatibility.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a creative and advanced decentralized art collective. It incorporates many trendy and cutting-edge concepts in the blockchain space while offering a unique approach to community-driven art curation and NFT marketplaces. Remember to adapt and expand upon this example to create a truly production-ready and innovative DAAC.
