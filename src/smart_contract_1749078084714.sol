Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several interesting, advanced, and somewhat trendy concepts like:

1.  **Dynamic Tokenomics:** Transaction fees that can be adjusted via governance.
2.  **Staking with Variable Yield/Lockup:** Staking tokens to earn rewards and gain governance power, potentially with different tiers or durations.
3.  **On-Chain Governance:** A system for proposing, voting on, and executing changes to contract parameters (like fees, reward rates).
4.  **Gamified Challenges/Achievements:** On-chain tasks users can complete for rewards or status.
5.  **Oracle Interaction:** Using Chainlink VRF for randomness in gamified events or rewards.
6.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular permissions using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`.
7.  **Non-Standard ERC20 Extensions:** Overriding transfer logic for fees.

We'll call this contract `ChronosEcosystemToken`.

### Chronos Ecosystem Token (CHRN) - Contract Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `ChronosEcosystemToken`

**Purpose:** Implements a dynamic ERC20 token (`CHRN`) with integrated staking, governance, gamified challenges, and oracle-based random events. Designed to demonstrate advanced concepts beyond standard token functionality.

**Inherits:**
*   `ERC20`: Standard token functionality.
*   `AccessControl`: Role-based permissions.
*   `VRFConsumerBaseV2`: Interacts with Chainlink VRF for randomness.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Dynamic Fees:** A percentage fee is taken on `transfer` and `transferFrom`, configurable via governance. Fees can be sent to a sink address or burned.
*   **Staking:** Users lock CHRN tokens to earn yield and voting power in governance. Staking duration/amount might influence yield/power.
*   **Governance:** Stakeholders propose parameter changes (fees, reward rates, challenge details). Proposals go through voting and execution phases.
*   **Challenges:** Pre-defined on-chain tasks (e.g., stake for X days, maintain Y balance) that users can complete for rewards/achievements.
*   **Random Events:** Governance or admin can trigger a request for randomness via Chainlink VRF. The resulting random number can trigger various outcomes (e.g., bonus reward distribution, temporary fee change).
*   **Access Control:** `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `GOVERNANCE_ROLE`, `CHALLENGE_MANAGER_ROLE` define who can perform sensitive actions.

**State Variables (Key):**
*   `_dynamicFeeRate`: Current percentage fee on transfers.
*   `_feeSinkAddress`: Address receiving the collected fees (or address 0x0 for burn).
*   `_stakingRewardRatePerSecond`: Staking reward rate.
*   `userStakes`: Mapping storing details of users' active stakes.
*   `proposals`: Mapping storing details of governance proposals.
*   `challenges`: Mapping storing details of defined challenges.
*   `userChallengeProgress`: Mapping tracking user progress on challenges.
*   Chainlink VRF variables (keyHash, s_subscriptionId, s_randomWords, s_requests, etc.).

**Functions (Summary):**

*   **Standard ERC20 Functions (9):**
    *   `constructor(address initialAdmin, address feeSink, uint96 subscriptionId, bytes32 keyHash, address vrfCoordinator)`: Initializes token, roles, and VRF.
    *   `name()`, `symbol()`, `decimals()`, `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf()`, `allowance()`: Standard views.
    *   `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers with dynamic fee.
    *   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Standard approval.
    *   `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers with dynamic fee (from allowance).

*   **Access Control Functions (3):**
    *   `grantRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Grant a role (ADMIN only).
    *   `renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: User removes their own role.
    *   `revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: Admin removes a role from an account.

*   **Staking Functions (5):**
    *   `stake(uint256 amount, uint256 lockDuration)`: Stakes tokens with an optional lockup period.
    *   `unstake(uint256 stakeId)`: Unstakes a specific stake entry after lockup (if any) and claims rewards.
    *   `claimStakingRewards(uint256 stakeId)`: Claims accrued rewards for a specific stake entry without unstaking.
    *   `getStakeInfo(address account, uint256 stakeId)`: Views details of a specific stake.
    *   `calculatePendingRewards(address account, uint256 stakeId)`: Views pending rewards for a specific stake.

*   **Governance Functions (7):**
    *   `createProposal(string description, uint256 proposalType, bytes data)`: Creates a new governance proposal (requires stake/role).
    *   `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Casts a vote on a proposal (requires stake/role). Voting power based on staked amount.
    *   `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal.
    *   `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Views the current state of a proposal.
    *   `getProposalInfo(uint256 proposalId)`: Views detailed info about a proposal.
    *   `setVotingPeriod(uint48 durationInBlocks)`: Governance role can set voting period.
    *   `setQuorumPercentage(uint16 percentage)`: Governance role can set required quorum.

*   **Gamified Challenges Functions (4):**
    *   `defineChallenge(string description, uint256 requiredStakeDuration, uint256 requiredBalance, uint256 rewardAmount)`: Defines a new challenge (CHALLENGE_MANAGER role).
    *   `claimChallengeCompletion(uint256 challengeId)`: User claims completion of a challenge. Contract verifies completion based on state.
    *   `getUserChallengeProgress(address account, uint256 challengeId)`: Views user progress on a challenge.
    *   `getChallengeDetails(uint256 challengeId)`: Views details of a defined challenge.

*   **Oracle / Random Event Functions (3):**
    *   `requestRandomEventTrigger()`: Requests randomness from Chainlink VRF (GOVERNANCE or ADMIN role). Costs LINK/ETH depending on VRF setup.
    *   `rawFulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] randomWords)`: Chainlink VRF callback function. Processes the random result and triggers a random event effect.
    *   `getRandomWords(uint256 requestId)`: Views the random words returned for a request (after callback).

*   **Dynamic Parameter Functions (Internal/Private Setters - called by `executeProposal`):**
    *   `_setDynamicFeeRate(uint16 newRate)`: Sets the transaction fee rate.
    *   `_setStakingRewardRate(uint256 newRate)`: Sets the staking reward rate.
    *   (Potentially others based on proposal types)

*   **Internal / View Helper Functions:**

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Design Choices:**

1.  **Dynamic Fee (`_transfer` override):** Instead of a fixed fee, we override the internal `_transfer` function from OpenZeppelin's ERC20. This allows us to intercept every token transfer, calculate a fee based on the current `_dynamicFeeRate`, subtract it from the amount transferred to the recipient, and send the fee to a designated `_feeSinkAddress` or burn it (if `_feeSinkAddress` is 0x0). The `_dynamicFeeRate` is a state variable changeable via governance.
2.  **Staking with Structure:** We use a `struct Stake` to store detailed information about each individual staking action a user takes (amount, start time, potential lock duration, claimed rewards, last claim time). A `mapping(address => Stake[])` stores an array of these structs for each user, allowing users to have multiple distinct stakes. A `userStakeCount` is used to simulate auto-incrementing IDs for each user's stakes (effectively the index in the array + 1). Rewards are calculated based on the time elapsed since the last claim and the current `_stakingRewardRatePerSecond`.
3.  **On-Chain Governance:**
    *   `Proposal` struct stores details like description, type, parameters (`bytes data`), voting period (`startBlock`, `endBlock`), votes, voters, and state.
    *   `createProposal`: Allows users with sufficient stake or the `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` to propose changes. The `ProposalType` and `bytes data` are flexible, allowing different types of proposals to be enacted by the same mechanism.
    *   `vote`: Allows eligible users to cast votes. Voting power is based on active staked tokens (`_calculateVotingPower`). An `EnumerableSet` is used to track who has voted for efficient iteration and preventing double voting.
    *   `executeProposal`: Allows anyone to trigger the execution of a *successful* proposal after the voting period ends. The function decodes the `data` based on the `proposalType` and calls the appropriate internal setter function (like `_setDynamicFeeRate`, `_setStakingRewardRate`).
    *   `_checkProposalState`: An internal helper (could be externalized or called by `executeProposal`) to transition a proposal from `Active` to `Succeeded` or `Failed` based on vote counts and quorum after the voting period ends. Quorum calculation based on `totalSupply()` is a simplification; a production system would need to track total *staked* voting power more accurately.
    *   `setVotingPeriod`, `setQuorumPercentage`: Parameters for the governance process itself can also be changed via governance proposals, making the system highly configurable.
4.  **Gamified Challenges:**
    *   `Challenge` struct defines criteria (required stake duration, balance, staked amount) and a reward.
    *   `defineChallenge`: Allows `CHALLENGE_MANAGER_ROLE` to create challenges.
    *   `claimChallengeCompletion`: Allows users to claim completion. The contract verifies the claim against the user's current or past on-chain state (`_verifyChallengeCompletion`). Rewards are transferred from the contract's balance.
    *   `_verifyChallengeCompletion`: Checks if a user's stake history or current balance/stake meets the challenge requirements.
5.  **Chainlink VRF:**
    *   Inherits `VRFConsumerBaseV2` and `ConfirmedOwner`.
    *   `requestRandomEventTrigger`: Allows authorized roles (`GOVERNANCE_ROLE`) to request randomness via the Chainlink VRF protocol. This consumes LINK/ETH from the configured subscription.
    *   `rawFulfillRandomWords`: The callback function automatically invoked by Chainlink after randomness is generated. It receives the `requestId` and the random number(s).
    *   `_triggerRandomEventEffect`: Contains example logic for what happens based on the random number. This is a placeholder; complex, gas-intensive effects might need off-chain processing triggered by events.
    *   `s_requests` mapping helps track requests and could link the callback result back to the original action or requester.
6.  **Access Control (`AccessControl`):** Uses OpenZeppelin's standard RBAC to define specific roles (`GOVERNANCE_ROLE`, `CHALLENGE_MANAGER_ROLE`) and restrict sensitive functions to those roles. The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` manages these roles.
7.  **EnumerableSet:** Used in the `Proposal` struct to efficiently track which addresses have voted, allowing iteration and checking for double voting without storing a large boolean mapping per proposal per address.

**Gas Considerations & Production Notes:**

*   **Staking Reward Calculation:** Calculating pending rewards on the fly for each stake is efficient. Calculating *total* voting power by iterating over all user stakes (as might be needed for precise quorum checking based on total staked supply) is gas-intensive and generally avoided in production for large numbers of users. A better approach involves tracking total staked tokens in a separate state variable updated during `stake` and `unstake`.
*   **Governance Quorum:** The quorum calculation based on `totalSupply()` is a simplification. Real systems often snapshot total staked tokens at proposal creation or use other mechanisms to determine quorum accurately and gas-efficiently.
*   **VRF Costs:** Requesting randomness costs gas and requires a funded Chainlink VRF subscription. The callback `rawFulfillRandomWords` also consumes gas (up to the `s_callbackGasLimit`).
*   **Challenge Verification:** `_verifyChallengeCompletion` iterates through a user's stakes. This is acceptable if users don't have an excessively large number of stake entries.
*   **Reward Distribution:** The example uses `_transfer(address(this), msg.sender, reward)`. The contract *must* hold enough CHRN tokens to cover challenge rewards. An alternative (used in the commented-out line) would be to grant the contract MINTER_ROLE and mint rewards, but granting minting authority to a contract with this much complex logic is generally very risky.
*   **Error Handling:** Custom errors are used for clarity and gas efficiency compared to `require` with strings.
*   **Upgradeability:** This contract is *not* upgradeable. For a production system, using a proxy pattern (like UUPS or Transparent Proxy) is highly recommended.

This contract provides a solid base demonstrating how to combine multiple advanced Solidity concepts into a single system, going well beyond a standard token contract. Remember that any contract deployed to a production network requires thorough auditing.
