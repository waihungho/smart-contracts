 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Do not use in production without thorough audit)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) with advanced features
 * for artists, collectors, and community governance. It includes functionalities for art piece management,
 * exhibitions, community voting on art curation and gallery features, dynamic pricing mechanisms, artist
 * revenue sharing, and more. This is a conceptual contract showcasing advanced Solidity concepts and
 * creative functionalities, designed to be different from standard open-source examples.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Art Piece Management:**
 * 1.  mintArtPiece(string memory _metadataURI): Mints a new unique Art Piece NFT.
 * 2.  transferArtPiece(address _to, uint256 _tokenId): Transfers ownership of an Art Piece NFT.
 * 3.  setArtPieceMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _metadataURI): Updates the metadata URI of an Art Piece.
 * 4.  burnArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId): Allows the owner to burn an Art Piece NFT.
 * 5.  getArtPieceOwner(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves the owner of a specific Art Piece.
 * 6.  getArtPieceMetadataURI(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves the metadata URI of an Art Piece.
 * 7.  getTotalArtPiecesMinted(): Returns the total number of Art Pieces minted.
 * 8.  getArtistArtPieces(address _artist): Returns a list of token IDs minted by a specific artist.
 *
 * **Exhibition Management:**
 * 9.  createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime): Creates a new art exhibition.
 * 10. addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artTokenId): Adds an Art Piece to a specific exhibition.
 * 11. removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artTokenId): Removes an Art Piece from an exhibition.
 * 12. endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Ends an ongoing exhibition.
 * 13. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 * 14. listActiveExhibitions(): Returns a list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **Community Governance & Features:**
 * 15. proposeNewFeature(string memory _featureProposal): Allows community members to propose new gallery features.
 * 16. voteOnFeatureProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Allows token holders to vote on feature proposals.
 * 17. executeFeatureProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a feature proposal if it reaches quorum and majority. (Admin function)
 * 18. setGalleryCommissionRate(uint256 _newRate): Sets the commission rate for art sales in the gallery. (Admin function with governance - example)
 * 19. suggestArtForCuration(uint256 _artTokenId): Allows community members to suggest Art Pieces for curated exhibitions.
 * 20. voteOnCurationSuggestion(uint256 _suggestionId, bool _vote):  Allows token holders to vote on curation suggestions.
 * 21. addCuratedArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _suggestionId): Adds a curated Art Piece to an exhibition based on community vote. (Admin/Curator function)
 * 22. setDynamicPricingAlgorithm(uint8 _algorithmId): Sets the algorithm for dynamic pricing of Art Pieces. (Advanced - example)
 * 23. getArtPiecePrice(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves the current dynamic price of an Art Piece. (Based on chosen algorithm)
 * 24. buyArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId): Allows users to purchase an Art Piece at its dynamic price.
 * 25. withdrawArtistEarnings(): Allows artists to withdraw their earnings from sales.
