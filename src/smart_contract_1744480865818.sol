 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * for collaborative art creation, curation, and community governance. It features advanced
 * concepts such as layered art contributions, community-driven curation, dynamic NFT evolution,
 * and decentralized governance mechanisms.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * **Governance Functions:**
 *   1. proposeNewRule(string memory description, bytes memory data): Allows members to propose new rules or modifications to the DAAC.
 *   2. voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support): Allows members to vote on governance proposals.
 *   3. enactRule(uint256 proposalId): Enacts a successful governance proposal, executing associated actions.
 *   4. setVotingDuration(uint256 durationInBlocks): Governance function to change the voting duration for proposals.
 *   5. setQuorum(uint256 newQuorum): Governance function to change the quorum required for proposal approval.
 *   6. stake(uint256 amount): Allows members to stake tokens to gain governance voting power.
 *   7. unstake(uint256 amount): Allows members to unstake tokens, reducing their voting power.
 *   8. getVotingPower(address member): Returns the voting power of a member based on staked tokens.
 *   9. rewardStakers(): Distributes rewards to stakers based on their staked amount and participation.
 *  10. withdrawRewards(): Allows stakers to withdraw their accrued rewards.
 *
 * **Art Creation & Curation Functions:**
 *  11. submitArtLayer(string memory layerName, string memory layerCID, uint256 royaltyPercentage): Allows members to submit art layers (e.g., backgrounds, characters, styles) with IPFS CID and royalty settings.
 *  12. voteOnArtLayer(uint256 layerId, bool approve): Allows community to vote on submitted art layers for inclusion in artworks.
 *  13. finalizeArtwork(string memory artworkName, uint256[] memory layerIds): Creates a final artwork by combining approved art layers, minting an NFT.
 *  14. viewArtwork(uint256 artworkId): Allows viewing details of a created artwork, including layers and creator royalties.
 *  15. proposeExhibition(string memory exhibitionName, uint256[] memory artworkIds, uint256 durationInBlocks): Allows members to propose art exhibitions featuring selected artworks.
 *  16. voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool approve): Allows community to vote on exhibition proposals.
 *  17. startExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId): Starts a approved art exhibition, potentially featuring it on a platform.
 *  18. endExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId): Ends an ongoing exhibition and potentially distributes rewards to featured artists.
 *  19. setCuratorRewardPercentage(uint256 percentage): Governance function to adjust the percentage of exhibition revenue allocated to curators.
 *  20. transferArtworkNFT(uint256 artworkId, address recipient): Allows the DAAC to transfer ownership of an artwork NFT (e.g., for prizes, collaborations).
 *  21. burnUnusedArtLayer(uint256 layerId): Governance function to burn (remove) an approved but unused art layer.
 *  22. setBaseURI(string memory newBaseURI): Governance function to set the base URI for artwork NFTs.
 *
 * **Events:**
 *   - RuleProposed(uint256 proposalId, string description, address proposer);
 *   - ProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool support);
 *   - RuleEnacted(uint256 proposalId, string description);
 *   - VotingDurationChanged(uint256 newDuration);
 *   - QuorumChanged(uint256 newQuorum);
 *   - Staked(address staker, uint256 amount);
 *   - Unstaked(address unstaker, uint256 amount);
 *   - RewardsDistributed(uint256 totalRewards);
 *   - RewardsWithdrawn(address staker, uint256 amount);
 *   - ArtLayerSubmitted(uint256 layerId, string layerName, address submitter);
 *   - ArtLayerVoted(uint256 layerId, address voter, bool approved);
 *   - ArtworkFinalized(uint256 artworkId, string artworkName, address minter);
 *   - ExhibitionProposed(uint256 proposalId, string exhibitionName, address proposer);
 *   - ExhibitionVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool approved);
 *   - ExhibitionStarted(uint256 exhibitionId, string exhibitionName);

**Function Summary:**

**Governance Functions:**

1.  **`proposeNewRule(string memory description, bytes memory data)`:** Allows staked members to propose new rules or contract modifications by submitting a description and encoded function call data.
2.  **`voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`:** Staked members can vote 'yes' or 'no' on active governance proposals. Voting power is determined by staked tokens.
3.  **`enactRule(uint256 proposalId)`:**  The governance contract (external address) can enact a successful proposal after the voting period if quorum is reached, executing the associated function call.
4.  **`setVotingDuration(uint256 durationInBlocks)`:** Governance function to change the voting period for future proposals.
5.  **`setQuorum(uint256 newQuorum)`:** Governance function to adjust the quorum percentage required for proposal approval.
6.  **`stake(uint256 amount)`:**  Allows members to stake tokens (assumed to be related to the DAAC ecosystem - *Note: In a real system, you would integrate with a token contract and handle token transfers securely*). Staking grants voting power.
7.  **`unstake(uint256 amount)`:** Members can unstake tokens, reducing their voting power.
8.  **`getVotingPower(address member)`:** Returns the voting power of a member, currently directly proportional to staked tokens.
9.  **`rewardStakers()`:**  Governance function to distribute staking rewards to members based on their staked amount and potentially participation in governance (e.g., voting).  *Note: Reward token distribution is simplified and would need integration with a reward token contract in a real system.*
10. **`withdrawRewards()`:** Allows staked members to withdraw their accumulated staking rewards.

**Art Creation & Curation Functions:**

11. **`submitArtLayer(string memory layerName, string memory layerCID, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`:** Staked members can submit art layers (like backgrounds, characters, styles) with a name, IPFS CID for the layer data, and a proposed royalty percentage for future use of the layer.
12. **`voteOnArtLayer(uint256 layerId, bool approve)`:** Staked members vote to approve or reject submitted art layers. Approved layers can be used in artworks.
13. **`finalizeArtwork(string memory artworkName, uint256[] memory layerIds)`:** Staked members can finalize an artwork by combining a set of approved art layers, giving it a name, and effectively minting an NFT representation (metadata is recorded on-chain, actual NFT minting would require integration with an NFT contract).
14. **`viewArtwork(uint256 artworkId)`:**  Allows anyone to view details of an artwork, including its name, the IDs of the layers used, the minter, mint timestamp, and the token URI (for metadata).
15. **`proposeExhibition(string memory exhibitionName, uint256[] memory artworkIds, uint256 durationInBlocks)`:** Staked members can propose art exhibitions featuring a curated selection of artworks and a proposed exhibition duration.
16. **`voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool approve)`:** Staked members vote on exhibition proposals.
17. **`startExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId)`:**  Governance function to start an approved exhibition, making it 'active' and potentially triggering off-chain processes to showcase the exhibition.
18. **`endExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId)`:** Governance function to end an active exhibition, potentially distributing rewards to curators and artists based on exhibition performance (simplified revenue model included).
19. **`setCuratorRewardPercentage(uint256 percentage)`:** Governance function to adjust the percentage of exhibition revenue allocated as rewards to curators.
20. **`transferArtworkNFT(uint256 artworkId, address recipient)`:** Governance function to transfer ownership of an artwork NFT (represented by the on-chain metadata in this contract) to another address. This could be used for prizes, collaborations, or other DAAC operations.
21. **`burnUnusedArtLayer(uint256 layerId)`:** Governance function to permanently remove (burn) an approved art layer that is deemed no longer useful or relevant.
22. **`setBaseURI(string memory newBaseURI)`:** Governance function to set the base URI used for constructing the metadata URIs for artwork NFTs, allowing for flexible metadata hosting.

**Key Concepts Highlighted:**

*   **Decentralized Governance:**  Uses proposals, voting, and quorum for community-driven decision-making on contract parameters, art curation, and operations.
*   **Layered Art Creation:**  Enables collaborative art by allowing the community to contribute reusable art layers that can be combined into final artworks.
*   **Community Curation:** Art layers and exhibitions are subject to community voting, ensuring a degree of collective taste and quality control.
*   **Dynamic NFT Representation:**  While not a full NFT implementation, the contract manages metadata and token URIs for artworks, representing them as unique digital assets tied to the blockchain.
*   **Staking and Rewards:**  Uses token staking to incentivize participation in governance and art creation, with a basic reward mechanism.
*   **Exhibitions and Curation Rewards:**  Introduces the concept of art exhibitions curated by the community, with potential rewards for curators and artists involved.
*   **Royalty System (Basic):**  Includes a basic royalty percentage setting for art layer creators, although a full royalty distribution system would require more sophisticated tracking of sales and revenue.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified Implementation:** This contract provides a conceptual framework. A production-ready DAAC would require significant enhancements in security, gas optimization, robust token and NFT integration, off-chain infrastructure for metadata management, and more detailed revenue/royalty tracking.
*   **Token and NFT Integration:**  The staking, rewards, and NFT aspects are simplified. In a real system, you would need to integrate with actual ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 token contracts and implement secure token transfers.
*   **Governance Contract:**  The contract assumes an external governance contract address.  In a real system, you might consider a more integrated governance module or use a dedicated governance framework.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  The code is written for clarity and concept demonstration, not necessarily for optimal gas efficiency. Gas optimization would be crucial for a live deployment.
*   **Security Audits:**  Any smart contract dealing with value and governance should undergo rigorous security audits before deployment.
