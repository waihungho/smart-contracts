This is an ambitious request, and creating truly "non-duplicate" advanced concepts while maintaining practical Solidity implementation is a fun challenge. I'll focus on a DAO that incorporates elements of **predictive governance, dynamic resource allocation, reputation-weighted decision-making, and conditional timelocks**, aiming for a highly adaptable and forward-looking organization.

I'll call this the **"QuantumLeap DAO"**. It's designed for funding high-impact, long-term projects that require deep analysis and commitment, mitigating short-term speculative behavior.

## QuantumLeap DAO Smart Contract

**Concept:** The QuantumLeap DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding and nurturing ambitious, long-term "leap" projects. Its core innovation lies in its multi-faceted governance model, which combines traditional voting with predictive markets, dynamic reputation systems, and "quantum-locked" conditional execution to ensure robust, well-considered decisions and efficient resource allocation.

**Key Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Predictive Governance (Quantum Entanglement Voting):** Participants don't just vote "yes/no," but also make predictions about a project's future success metrics. Their voting power and reputation are influenced by the accuracy of their past predictions.
2.  **Dynamic Reputation System:** Participant reputation is not solely based on token holdings, but on active, accurate participation in governance, project reviews, and prediction markets. This reputation dynamically influences voting power, proposal priority, and reward distribution.
3.  **Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Treasury funds are allocated not just based on simple votes, but on a composite score derived from voting outcomes, predictive market sentiment, and project milestone achievements. Funding can be dynamically adjusted.
4.  **Quantum Lock (Conditional Timelock):** Certain high-impact decisions or fund releases are "quantum-locked," meaning they can only be executed if a set of complex, predefined on-chain or off-chain (via oracle) conditions are met, not just a simple time elapsed.
5.  **Time-Dilation Staking:** Tokens staked for longer periods grant disproportionately higher reputation and voting power multipliers, discouraging short-term speculation and rewarding long-term commitment.
6.  **Decentralized Project Review & Milestone System:** Projects undergo a multi-stage review process by elected "Quantum Guardians," and funding is disbursed incrementally upon verifiable milestone completion.

### Outline and Function Summary

**I. Core DAO Mechanics & Configuration**
1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the DAO with core parameters.
2.  `updateDAOConfig()`: Allows the DAO to vote on and update its own operational parameters (e.g., proposal fee, review duration).
3.  `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
4.  `withdrawFunds()`: Allows the DAO to vote on and execute treasury withdrawals for approved purposes (e.g., operational costs, non-project expenses).

**II. Membership & Reputation Management**
5.  `joinDAO()`: Allows users to join the DAO by paying an initial membership fee (or staking).
6.  `exitDAO()`: Allows members to leave, potentially forfeiting some stake/reputation if conditions are not met.
7.  `getParticipantReputation()`: Returns the current reputation score of a participant.
8.  `updateParticipantReputation()`: Internal function (or called by specific actions) to adjust a participant's reputation based on their actions (e.g., accurate predictions, timely reviews).

**III. Project Lifecycle Management**
9.  `proposeProject()`: Allows a DAO member to submit a new project proposal, requiring a fee and initial details.
10. `progressProjectToReview()`: DAO governance moves a proposed project into the Quantum Guardian review phase.
11. `submitReviewFeedback()`: Quantum Guardians submit their detailed, encrypted (conceptually, on-chain hash) or public review feedback.
12. `startProjectVotingAndPrediction()`: Initiates the multi-phase voting and prediction market for an approved project.
13. `voteOnProject()`: Allows participants to cast their primary vote on a project.
14. `submitPredictionMarketVote()`: Allows participants to submit their predictions regarding project success metrics (e.g., 90% chance of achieving target X).
15. `finalizeProjectVotingAndPrediction()`: Concludes the voting and prediction phases, calculating a composite approval score.
16. `initiateProjectExecution()`: Moves an approved project into the execution phase, potentially releasing initial funds.
17. `submitMilestoneCompletion()`: Project lead submits proof of milestone completion.
18. `verifyMilestone()`: Quantum Guardians or specific DAO vote verifies a submitted milestone.
19. `fundMilestone()`: Releases the next tranche of funding upon verified milestone completion.
20. `reportProjectFailure()`: Allows reporting a project as failed, leading to review and potential fund reallocation.
21. `disputeProjectOutcome()`: Mechanism for DAO members to dispute a project's final outcome or status.

**IV. Advanced Governance & Economic Models**
22. `stakeForTimeDilation()`: Allows members to stake tokens for extended periods to boost their reputation and voting power via "time dilation" multipliers.
23. `unstakeFromTimeDilation()`: Allows unstaking, potentially with a penalty if unstaked early.
24. `initiateQuantumLock()`: DAO governance can propose to "quantum-lock" specific funds or contract functions until complex, verifiable conditions are met (e.g., "activate if BTC price > X AND AI index Y > Z").
25. `releaseQuantumLock()`: Triggers the release of a quantum lock once all conditions are externally verified (e.g., by oracle input).
26. `setOracleAddress()`: Sets the address of a trusted oracle for external data verification (e.g., for quantum locks or prediction market resolution).

**V. Quantum Guardians & Special Roles**
27. `nominateQuantumGuardian()`: Members can nominate other members to become Quantum Guardians.
28. `voteForQuantumGuardian()`: DAO members vote to elect Quantum Guardians.
29. `assignGuardianReviewDuty()`: DAO assigns specific projects for review to elected Quantum Guardians.
