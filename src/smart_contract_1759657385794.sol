This smart contract, named `AetherForge`, is designed as an adaptive, decentralized protocol for fostering innovation through project funding, milestone-based releases, and a unique reputation-weighted judgment system. It aims to create a "self-optimizing" ecosystem where protocol parameters and project rewards dynamically adjust based on on-chain metrics, project impact, and community consensus.

The core advanced concepts include:
1.  **Adaptive Economic Parameters:** Protocol fees and project reward multipliers can dynamically adjust based on global protocol health metrics (e.g., total value locked, active projects, cumulative impact).
2.  **Reputation-Weighted Judgement:** Users can stake tokens to predict the success or failure of project milestones. Accurate predictions earn reputation and rewards, while inaccurate ones incur penalties. This incentivizes informed evaluation and combats sybil attacks in project assessment.
3.  **Oracle Integration for Impact Assessment:** The protocol interfaces with an external "Impact Oracle" to objectively assess project milestones and assign impact scores, which further influence funding and rewards.
4.  **Epoch-Based Progression:** The protocol operates in epochs, with key parameters (like reputation decay, metric recalculation) updated at each epoch transition.
5.  **Modular Project Funding:** Projects define milestones, and funding is released incrementally upon successful completion and evaluation of each milestone, with potential for dynamic reward adjustments.

## AetherForge Smart Contract: Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `AetherForge`

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Projects:** Units of innovation proposed by users with defined funding goals and milestones.
*   **Milestones:** Incremental goals within a project, each with a target impact and funding release amount.
*   **Impact Oracle:** An external, assumedly decentralized, service that provides objective assessments of project impact and milestone completion.
*   **Reputation:** An internal score earned by users who make accurate predictions on project milestone outcomes. Influences future protocol interactions.
*   **Judgement Staking:** Users stake tokens to predict milestone outcomes, influencing project evaluation and earning reputation/rewards for accuracy.
*   **Adaptive Parameters:** Protocol parameters (like reward multipliers) dynamically adjust based on aggregated metrics and oracle data.
*   **Epochs:** Time-based cycles for protocol state updates and maintenance.

### Function Summary

**I. Core Protocol Management (Owner/Admin Functions)**
1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with an owner, initial epoch duration, fee rates, and token addresses.
2.  `setEpochDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Allows the owner to update the duration of an epoch.
3.  `setProtocolFeeRate(uint256 _newRate)`: Allows the owner to adjust the percentage fee collected by the protocol from funding releases.
4.  `updateAdaptiveParameterWeight(string calldata _paramName, uint256 _newWeight)`: Sets the influence weight of various protocol metrics on the dynamic reward multiplier.
5.  `withdrawProtocolFees(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated protocol fees.
6.  `setImpactOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Allows the owner to update the address of the external Impact Oracle contract.
7.  `setFundingTokenAddress(address _newFundingToken)`: Allows the owner to update the address of the ERC-20 token used for project funding.

**II. Project Lifecycle & Funding**
8.  `proposeProject(string calldata _name, string calldata _description, uint256 _fundingGoal, Milestone[] calldata _milestones)`: Allows a user to propose a new project with its details, funding goal, and defined milestones. Requires a minimum stake.
9.  `approveProjectProposal(uint256 _projectId)`: (Admin/Governance) Approves a proposed project, moving it to an 'Active' state and making it eligible for funding.
10. `depositFunding(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows any user to contribute `fundingToken` to an active project.
11. `submitMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, string calldata _proofHash)`: Project proposer submits evidence of a milestone's completion, initiating the judgement and evaluation phase.
12. `evaluateMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: Triggers the formal evaluation of a submitted milestone by querying the `ImpactOracle`.
13. `claimMilestoneFunding(uint256 _projectId)`: Allows the project proposer to claim funds for successfully evaluated milestones, factoring in dynamic reward multipliers and protocol fees.
14. `withdrawUnspentProjectFunds(uint256 _projectId)`: Allows the project proposer to withdraw any remaining, unspent funds after all milestones are completed or the project is canceled (if permitted).
15. `cancelProject(uint256 _projectId)`: Allows the project proposer or governance to cancel an active project. Unspent funds are returned or reallocated.

**III. Reputation & Judgement System**
16. `stakeForMilestoneJudgement(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, bool _predictSuccess, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake `fundingToken` to predict whether a specific milestone will be successfully completed.
17. `resolveMilestoneJudgement(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: Called after a milestone has been evaluated by the Oracle. Distributes rewards/penalties to stakers based on prediction accuracy and updates reputation scores.
18. `claimJudgementStakeRewards(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _judgementId)`: Allows stakers to claim their rewards (or refunds) after a judgement has been resolved.
19. `getReputationScore(address _user)`: (View) Returns the current reputation score of a given user.

**IV. Adaptive Mechanics & Status Queries**
20. `advanceEpoch()`: Callable by anyone (with an incentive) to transition the protocol to the next epoch, triggering reputation decay, metric recalculations, and adaptive parameter updates.
21. `updateDynamicRewardMultiplier(uint256 _projectId)`: Internal function (can be made external with incentive) to recalculate the dynamic reward multiplier for a project based on its impact score and global protocol health.
22. `getProjectStatus(uint256 _projectId)`: (View) Returns a detailed struct containing the current status and metrics of a specific project.
23. `getCurrentAdaptiveParameters()`: (View) Returns a set of the currently active protocol parameters (e.g., dynamic reward multiplier, effective fee rate) after adaptation.
24. `getEstimatedMilestoneReward(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: (View) Calculates and returns the estimated `fundingToken` amount a project proposer would receive for a specific milestone, factoring in current adaptive multipliers and fees.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is a conceptual example for educational and demonstrative purposes. It contains advanced features and assumptions (e.g., a fully functional `IImpactOracle`). For a production environment, rigorous security audits, comprehensive testing, and potentially more decentralized governance mechanisms would be essential.
