This smart contract, named **Autonomous Evolutionary Resource Management (AERM) Protocol**, presents a conceptual framework for a decentralized system where "Evolutionary Agents" (represented as dynamic NFTs) manage staked resources in "Adaptive Pools." These agents operate based on evolving strategies, influenced by external "Environmental Signals" (oracle data) and community governance. The goal is to simulate a self-optimizing network capable of adaptive resource allocation, inspired by concepts from artificial intelligence, evolutionary algorithms, and decentralized finance.

## Autonomous Evolutionary Resource Management (AERM) Protocol

### Outline and Function Summary

**I. Protocol Core & Configuration (Owner/Admin/Governance)**

1.  **`initializeProtocol`**: Initializes core protocol settings like oracle address, reward/staking tokens, and initial fees. Callable once by the owner.
2.  **`setProtocolParameters`**: Allows governance to update various protocol-wide adjustable parameters (e.g., agent creation fees, minimum stake, governance thresholds).
3.  **`updateOracleAddress`**: Changes the address of the trusted oracle that provides environmental signals.
4.  **`updateGovernanceAddress`**: Updates the address designated for governance actions (e.g., a multisig or DAO contract).
5.  **`pauseProtocol`**: Initiates an emergency pause, halting most state-changing operations.
6.  **`unpauseProtocol`**: Resumes protocol operations after a pause.

**II. Evolutionary Agent (NFT) Management**

7.  **`createEvolutionaryAgent`**: Mints a new `EvolutionaryAgent` NFT, requiring a creation fee and an initial stake that seeds the agent's adaptive pool. The agent receives an initial strategy.
8.  **`retireEvolutionaryAgent`**: Burns an `EvolutionaryAgent` NFT, allowing the owner to reclaim associated staked resources and ensuring final reward distribution.
9.  **`proposeAgentStrategyUpgrade`**: An agent owner can propose an upgrade to their agent's strategy parameters, incurring a fee, which then enters a governance voting phase.
10. **`voteOnStrategyUpgrade`**: Allows the governance entity to vote on a proposed agent strategy upgrade.
11. **`executeAgentStrategyUpgrade`**: Applies an approved strategy upgrade to an `EvolutionaryAgent`, updating its operational parameters.
12. **`queryAgentCurrentStrategy`**: Retrieves the current strategy parameters of a specified agent.
13. **`transferEvolutionaryAgent`**: Transfers ownership of an `EvolutionaryAgent` NFT (standard ERC721 transfer).

**III. Adaptive Pool & Staking**

14. **`stakeToAdaptivePool`**: Users stake tokens into a specific `EvolutionaryAgent`'s adaptive pool, contributing to its managed capital.
15. **`unstakeFromAdaptivePool`**: Users withdraw their staked tokens from an agent's adaptive pool.
16. **`distributePoolRewards`**: A designated entity (e.g., governance or an off-chain keeper) triggers the distribution of rewards to stakers of an agent's pool based on its performance.
17. **`claimPoolRewards`**: Allows individual stakers to claim their accumulated rewards from an agent's pool.

**IV. Oracle & Environmental Signals**

18. **`submitEnvironmentalSignal`**: The trusted oracle submits new off-chain environmental data (e.g., market conditions, AI-generated insights) that agents can react to.
19. **`getLatestEnvironmentalSignal`**: Retrieves the most recently submitted environmental signal data and its timestamp.

**V. Evolution & Feedback Mechanisms**

20. **`initiateAdaptiveRebalance`**: Triggers an `EvolutionaryAgent` to perform a rebalance of its managed assets, based on its current strategy and the latest environmental signals. This action is typically informed by off-chain computation.
21. **`proposeAgentReplication`**: Governance proposes to replicate a high-performing agent's strategy into a new `EvolutionaryAgent`, fostering the "evolution" of successful strategies.
22. **`voteOnAgentReplication`**: Allows governance to vote on an agent replication proposal.
23. **`executeAgentReplication`**: Mints a new `EvolutionaryAgent` NFT based on an approved replication proposal, allowing for the propagation of successful strategies.
24. **`initiateStrategyMutation`**: Triggers a minor, algorithmically guided "mutation" of an agent's strategy parameters, introducing variation for evolutionary exploration.
25. **`submitCatalystProposal`**: A user proposes a new initiative (e.g., research for novel agent strategies, platform development) and requests funding from the protocol treasury.
26. **`voteOnCatalystProposal`**: Governance/stakers vote on a Catalyst funding proposal.
27. **`fundCatalystProposal`**: Executes an approved Catalyst funding proposal, marking the funds as available for withdrawal by the recipient.
28. **`withdrawCatalystFunds`**: The designated recipient withdraws funds for an approved and funded Catalyst proposal.

/**
 * @title Autonomous Evolutionary Resource Management (AERM) Protocol
 * @dev This contract implements a novel system for decentralized, adaptive resource allocation
 *      and management using "Evolutionary Agents" represented by dynamic NFTs.
 *      These agents manage staked tokens in "Adaptive Pools" based on evolving strategies,
 *      informed by "Environmental Signals" (off-chain oracle data) and community governance.
 *      The protocol aims to create a self-optimizing network where strategies can be proposed,
 *      approved, mutated, and replicated based on performance and collective intelligence.
 *
 *      Key Concepts:
 *      - Evolutionary Agents (NFTs): ERC721 tokens representing autonomous strategies. Each agent has
 *        parameters dictating its resource allocation logic within its Adaptive Pool. These are "dynamic"
 *        in the sense that their underlying strategy parameters can be updated via governance.
 *      - Adaptive Pools: Token pools where users stake assets, managed by a specific Evolutionary Agent.
 *      - Environmental Signals: Off-chain data (e.g., market volatility, AI insights, or other complex metrics)
 *        provided by a trusted oracle, which agents can use as input to adjust their strategies.
 *      - Strategy Evolution: Mechanisms for agents' strategies to adapt, mutate, or be replicated
 *        based on performance signals and governance decisions, mimicking evolutionary processes.
 *      - Catalyst Program: A decentralized funding mechanism for proposing new agent strategies, research,
 *        or general protocol improvements, requiring community approval.
 *
 *      Disclaimer: This is a conceptual contract for demonstration purposes.
 *      It abstracts complex off-chain logic (AI/ML models, detailed strategy execution,
 *      sophisticated reward calculations, or truly autonomous rebalancing) to on-chain
 *      state changes triggered by oracles or governance. A real-world implementation
 *      would require significant off-chain infrastructure and a more robust DAO system.
