Okay, let's design a smart contract incorporating multiple interacting concepts: a decentralized platform for collaborative synergy, resource pooling, dynamic reputation (Synergy Points), and governed resource distribution.

This contract, `DecentralizedAutonomousSynergyHub`, allows users to stake approved ERC-20 tokens, earn non-transferable "Synergy Points" (SP) based on their stake and duration, use SP for governance actions (proposals, voting), use SP to signal perceived value of contributions (simulated), and claim pooled rewards distributed based on their share of total SP.

It avoids simple staking/unstaking, basic ERC-20, or standard NFT implementations.

        // 2. When a user calls `claimPooledRewards`, calculate their *share* of the total distributed pool
        //    based on their SP balance *at the time of distribution snapshot*.
        // This requires a more complex SP snapshotting mechanism (like Compound's COMP distribution).

        // *current* SP relative to *total current* SP at distribution time, and add to their claimable.
        // This simpler approach means SP balance fluctuations *after* distribution but *before* claiming
        // affect the calculation, which might not be ideal but is gas-efficient.

        // A more robust (but complex) approach:
        // 1. When distribute is called, record totalSPAtDistribution.
        // 2. When deposit happens, add rewards to a queue/list along with totalSPAtDistribution.
        // 3. When user claims, iterate through pools/queues distributed *since their last claim*,
        //    calculate their share of *each* pool based on their SP at *that pool's distribution time*.
        // Let's stick to the simpler model for this example: current SP / total current SP at distribution time.

        // For simplicity and gas efficiency in this example, we will NOT calculate and assign claimable rewards
        // for *all* users in this function. Instead, we update the state to reflect that rewards have been
        // distributed for this token *proportional to total SP*. Users will calculate and claim their share
        // when they call `claimPooledRewards`.

        // The `userClaimableRewards` mapping is updated when the user calls `claimPooledRewards`.
        // We just record that this pool was distributed and the total SP at that moment.
        // The `userClaimableRewards[user][token]` tracks the *accumulated* amount the user can claim.
        // The calculation happens in `claimPooledRewards`.

        // We emit an event signalling the distribution and the total SP at that time.
        // The actual calculation of each user's share of *this specific pool* happens in `claimPooledRewards`.
        emit PooledRewardsDistributed(token, amountToDistribute, currentTotalSP);

        // Need a way for `claimPooledRewards` to know about past distribution events.
        // This simple model relies on the user claiming *after* a distribution happens.
        // A more advanced model might use checkpoints or snapshots.
        // Let's add a simple checkpoint system for reward distribution tracking.

        // Checkpoint system for reward distribution tracking:
        // Record total SP at key moments. Users claim based on their SP *between* checkpoints.
        // This gets complex fast.
        // Let's revert to the simplest interpretation for this example:
        // User claims their share of *all currently available* `pooledRewards[token]` based on their *current* SP.
        // This means rewards are constantly being added to a single pool, and users claim their dynamic share.

        // Simpler Model: pooledRewards[token] is the pool. claimPooledRewards claims user's current share.
        // The `distributePooledRewards` function doesn't actually distribute, it just signals / manages the pool?
        // No, the request implies distribution. Let's make it distribute to a claimable balance.

        // Okay, new strategy for efficiency: When `distributePooledRewards` is called:
        // 1. Take the amount `pooledRewards[token]`.
        // 2. Take `totalSynergyPoints`.
        // 3. The contract now owes `amountToDistribute` tokens distributed over `totalSynergyPoints`.
        // 4. We need to track how much each user is owed *from this specific distribution event*.
        // This still points to a snapshot/checkpoint system or iterating users (gas).

        // Alternative: The `distributePooledRewards` function simply empties the pool, and the *entire* amount
        // becomes available for claim proportionally to SP. `claimPooledRewards` then calculates the user's
        // share of the *entire history* of distributed pools based on their SP *at each distribution event*.
        // This requires storing per-distribution snapshots or cumulative share rates.

        // Let's use a cumulative rate mechanism, similar to some yield farming contracts (but based on SP).
        // `cumulativeRewardPerSP[token]`: This is the total amount of token X distributed *per SP unit* over time.
        // When rewards are distributed: `cumulativeRewardPerSP[token] += amountToDistribute / totalSynergyPoints`.
        // When user claims: `claimable = synergyPoints[user] * cumulativeRewardPerSP[token] - userRewardDebt[user][token]`.
        // `userRewardDebt[user][token] = synergyPoints[user] * cumulativeRewardPerSP[token]` after claiming.

This contract provides a framework for a dynamic, community-governed platform centered around participation measured by "Synergy Points," offering features like multi-token staking, SP accrual and usage, governance, and SP-based reward distribution. The concepts of non-transferable SP, SP used for signaling, cumulative reward distribution rate, and integrated governance over key parameters make it more advanced than a standard staking or DAO contract.
