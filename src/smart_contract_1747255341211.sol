Okay, let's design a smart contract that plays with concepts inspired by quantum mechanics and advanced scheduling, combined with vault functionalities. This won't involve actual quantum computation (impossible on current EVM), but uses the *ideas* of superposition, observation, entanglement, and probabilistic outcomes as metaphors for contract state management.

We'll call it `QuantumVault`.

**Concept:**
A vault contract where certain states or actions are subject to "quantum" rules:
1.  **Superposition Lock:** The vault can be in a state of "potential" lock (locked/unlocked) until an "observation" function is called, which resolves the state probabilistically or based on external conditions/randomness.
2.  **Entangled Values:** Two stored values are linked such that modifying one *might* probabilistically affect the other.
3.  **Probabilistic State Change:** Certain state changes require on-chain randomness (simulated here) to determine the outcome or parameters (like withdrawal fees).
4.  **Delayed/Conditional Execution:** Transactions can be scheduled to execute at a future time or upon meeting a condition, potentially influenced by resolved "quantum" states.
5.  **Quantum Tunneling:** A special, high-cost withdrawal that can bypass standard locks under specific circumstances.

This contract is **highly complex and experimental**. It is designed purely for demonstrating advanced concepts and should **not** be used in production without rigorous auditing and understanding of its non-standard behavior. It also uses a simulated randomness callback, which in a real-world scenario would require an oracle like Chainlink VRF.
