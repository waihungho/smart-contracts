Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Quantum Vault". This contract allows users to deposit and manage ERC-20 tokens, ETH, and ERC-721 NFTs in personal, conditionally unlockable vaults.

It incorporates several advanced/creative concepts:

1.  **Multi-Asset Vaults:** Holds ERC-20, ETH, and ERC-721.
2.  **Conditional Unlocking:** Allows unlocking based on time *and* an arbitrary, user-defined condition verified via provided proof/data. (Simulated with a placeholder `_checkConditionalUnlock` function demonstrating how different proof types could be integrated).
3.  **Quantum Phase Shift:** An admin-controlled parameter per vault that could influence unlock conditions or other logic.
4.  **Granular Delegation:** Users can delegate specific deposit/withdrawal rights to other addresses.
5.  **Custom Vault Data:** Users can store arbitrary key-value `bytes` data within their vault state.
6.  **Vault Ownership Transfer:** Allows users to transfer their entire vault (including contents and state) to another address.
7.  **Service Fee Concept:** Includes functions for paying and checking a hypothetical service fee status (logic not fully implemented but shows the structure).
8.  **Admin Controls:** Pause, set status, trigger phase shifts, rescue accidentally sent tokens.

This contract aims to be a complex example, going beyond basic locking or simple token holding. It is **not audited** and should not be used in production without a thorough security review.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Functions:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vaults (`erc20Balances`, `ethBalances`, `erc721Holdings` mappings):** The contract manages balances for multiple types of assets within a single `Vault` structure attributed to a user's address. `erc721Holdings` is structured to map the *NFT itself* to its owning *vault owner address* within the contract's context, simplifying tracking internal ownership vs. external.
    *   Functions: `depositERC20`, `depositETH`, `depositERC721`, `withdrawERC20`, `withdrawETH`, `withdrawERC721`, `checkVaultERC20Balance`, `checkVaultHasNFT`, `onERC721Received`.

2.  **Conditional Unlocking (`lockEndTime`, `conditionalUnlockParameters`, `_checkConditionalUnlock`, `unlockVault`, `setConditionalUnlockParameters`, `simulateConditionalUnlock`):** This is a key feature. Vaults can be locked by time *and* a user-defined condition.
    *   `setConditionalUnlockParameters`: Allows the user to store arbitrary `bytes` data in their vault. This data *defines* the condition (e.g., it could contain an Oracle price threshold, a Merkle root hash, a target block number, etc.).
    *   `_checkConditionalUnlock`: This internal view function is the core of the logic. It takes the vault's stored `conditionalUnlockParameters` and `conditionalProof` (provided during the `unlockVault` call) and returns `true` if the condition is met. The placeholder implementation shows how you'd use `if/else if` or switch statements based on the `parameters` to implement different condition types (Merkle proof, Oracle check, state check, etc.). This is where the "advanced" logic would reside.
    *   `unlockVault`: Only succeeds if both the time lock (`lockEndTime`) has passed *AND* `_checkConditionalUnlock` returns true with the provided `conditionalProof`.
    *   `simulateConditionalUnlock`: A view function allowing users to test if a given `conditionalProof` would work with their current parameters, without attempting a state-changing unlock.

3.  **Quantum Phase Shift (`quantumPhaseShift`, `triggerQuantumPhaseShift`, `getVaultQuantumPhaseShift`):** A `bytes32` variable stored per vault, settable only by the contract owner (`triggerQuantumPhaseShift`). This represents an arbitrary state or parameter that could influence other parts of the contract's logic, such as making conditional unlocks harder or easier depending on its value, or affecting theoretical service fee rates. Its *effect* needs to be implemented in other functions (e.g., `_checkConditionalUnlock`).

4.  **Granular Delegation (`DelegatePermissions`, `delegates`, `delegateAccess`, `revokeAccess`, `getDelegatePermissions`, `delegateWithdrawERC20`, `delegateWithdrawETH`, `delegateWithdrawERC721`, `delegateDepositERC20`):** Users can grant specific deposit and withdrawal permissions (broken down by asset type) to other addresses using `delegateAccess`. These delegates can then call specific `delegate*` functions to manage assets in the owner's vault. `revokeAccess` removes all permissions for a delegatee.

5.  **Custom Vault Data (`customData`, `setVaultCustomData`, `getVaultCustomData`):** A `mapping(bytes32 => bytes)` within the `Vault` struct allows users to store arbitrary key-value data associated with their vault. This could be used for metadata, configuration specific to off-chain applications interacting with the vault, etc.

6.  **Vault Ownership Transfer (`transferVaultOwnership`):** Allows a user to transfer their entire vault (including attributed assets, lock state, conditional parameters, phase shift) to a new address. The old vault is marked as `Deactivated`. *Note: The current implementation has limitations on transferring mapping contents efficiently and custom data/delegates are not carried over automatically.*

7.  **Service Fee Concept (`lastServiceFeePaid`, `serviceFeePeriod`, `payServiceFee`, `checkServiceFeeStatus`):** Includes basic functions to track when a user last "paid" a service fee. The actual fee payment and logic requiring the fee to be current before certain actions (like withdrawal) are placeholders but show how such a system could be integrated.

8.  **Admin Controls (`owner`, `paused`, `adminSetVaultStatus`, `adminPauseContract`, `adminUnpauseContract`, `drainERC20`, `drainETH`):** Standard administrative functions for pausing the contract, overriding a vault's status (for emergencies), and rescuing tokens/ETH accidentally sent to the contract address instead of a user's vault. `drainERC20` and `drainETH` carry a security risk if not used carefully.

This contract provides a framework for a sophisticated vault system with several interconnected advanced features. Remember to replace the placeholder logic in `_checkConditionalUnlock` and integrate the service fee checks into relevant functions for a fully functional implementation.
