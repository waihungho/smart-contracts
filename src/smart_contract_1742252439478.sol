/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract representing a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery,
 * incorporating advanced concepts like dynamic NFTs, decentralized curation,
 * collaborative art creation, on-chain reputation, and evolving exhibitions.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art Management:**
 *    - `submitArt(string memory _artHash, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to submit their artwork (NFT) to the gallery.
 *    - `mintArtNFT(uint256 _artId)`: Mints an ERC-721 NFT for approved artwork.
 *    - `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork.
 *    - `getAllArtIds()`: Returns a list of all artwork IDs in the gallery.
 *    - `setArtPrice(uint256 _artId, uint256 _price)`: Allows the artist to set the price of their artwork.
 *    - `purchaseArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows users to purchase artwork directly from the gallery.
 *    - `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Allows artists to withdraw their earnings from sold artworks.
 *
 * **2. Decentralized Curation and Governance:**
 *    - `proposeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Allows existing curators to propose new curator addresses.
 *    - `voteForCurator(address _curatorAddress, bool _vote)`: Allows curators to vote for or against proposed curators.
 *    - `addCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Adds a curator if proposal passes (internal function).
 *    - `removeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Allows curators to vote to remove a curator.
 *    - `approveArtForExhibition(uint256 _artId)`: Allows curators to approve submitted art for exhibition.
 *    - `rejectArtSubmission(uint256 _artId, string memory _reason)`: Allows curators to reject art submissions with a reason.
 *    - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows curators to create new exhibitions.
 *    - `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Allows curators to add approved art to an exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Allows curators to remove art from an exhibition.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Returns a list of currently active exhibition IDs.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic NFT and Evolving Art Concepts:**
 *    - `setDynamicMetadataFunction(uint256 _artId, string memory _functionName)`:  Allows artists to link a dynamic function to their NFT metadata update logic (placeholder/concept).
 *    - `triggerDynamicMetadataUpdate(uint256 _artId)`:  Function to trigger the dynamic metadata update process (placeholder/concept - would require off-chain oracles/services in a real implementation).
 *
 * **4. Community and Reputation System:**
 *    - `upvoteArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows community members to upvote artwork, influencing reputation.
 *    - `downvoteArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows community members to downvote artwork, influencing reputation.
 *    - `getArtReputation(uint256 _artId)`: Retrieves the reputation score of an artwork based on community votes.
 *
 * **5. Gallery Management and Settings:**
 *    - `setGalleryName(string memory _name)`: Allows the gallery owner to set the gallery name.
 *    - `getGalleryName()`: Retrieves the gallery name.
 *    - `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Allows the gallery owner to set a platform fee on art sales.
 *    - `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows the gallery owner to set the voting duration for curator proposals.
 *    - `getVotingDuration()`: Retrieves the current voting duration.
 *    - `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Allows the gallery owner to transfer ownership of the contract.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts Highlighted:**
 *  - Decentralized Curation through Curator Voting.
 *  - Dynamic NFTs (concept for evolving art metadata).
 *  - On-chain Reputation System (community-driven art evaluation).
 *  - Exhibition Management (curated art displays).
 *  - Autonomous Governance (DAO-like curator selection and management).
 *  - Platform Fees and Revenue Sharing (sustainable gallery model).
