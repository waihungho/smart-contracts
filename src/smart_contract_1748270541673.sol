Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Decentralized Autonomous Syndicate" (DAS). This contract incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic reputation-weighted voting, liquid delegation of voting power, treasury management with arbitrary call execution via proposals, and a basic system for setting and tracking collective goals, all managed by the syndicate members through a decentralized governance process.

It aims to be a unique combination of features not typically found together in standard open-source DAO templates like Compound's Governor or Aragon, focusing on a more flexible, reputation-based model for smaller, goal-oriented groups.

---

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `DecentralizedAutonomousSyndicate`

**Purpose:** To create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structured as a "Syndicate". Members pool resources, manage a shared treasury, make collective decisions via reputation-weighted voting with liquid delegation, and pursue shared goals defined and tracked within the contract.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Syndicate Membership:** Managed by governance proposals.
*   **Reputation-Weighted Voting:** Voting power is based on a dynamic 'reputation' score assigned to members via governance.
*   **Liquid Delegation:** Members can delegate their voting power to another member.
*   **Decentralized Treasury:** Holds ETH (and potentially other assets via proposals), managed solely by governance proposals.
*   **Flexible Proposals:** Proposals can execute arbitrary code calls on any contract, allowing for diverse actions (treasury withdrawals, parameter changes, member management, goal updates, etc.).
*   **Timelock:** Successful proposals are queued and subject to a timelock before execution for security.
*   **Collective Goals:** The syndicate can define and track shared objectives via the governance system.

**Functions Summary (20+ Functions):**

**Core Governance Functions:**
1.  `constructor`: Initializes the syndicate with core parameters and potentially an initial admin/member.
2.  `submitProposal`: Allows a member to create a new proposal with a description and a list of actions to be executed if the proposal passes.
3.  `voteOnProposal`: Allows a member (or their delegate) to cast a vote (Yes, No, Abstain) on an active proposal, weighted by their current voting power (reputation + delegated).
4.  `delegateReputation`: Allows a member to delegate their entire voting power to another member.
5.  `undelegateReputation`: Allows a member to reclaim their delegated voting power.
6.  `queueProposal`: Moves a successful proposal from 'Succeeded' state to 'Queued' state, setting its execution time based on the timelock. Only runnable after the voting period ends and the proposal passed quorum/majority.
7.  `executeProposal`: Executes the actions defined in a proposal that is in the 'Queued' state and has passed its timelock delay.
8.  `cancelProposal`: Allows canceling a proposal under specific conditions (e.g., failed quorum, before voting starts, or by a governance action).
9.  `depositTreasuryETH`: A payable function allowing anyone to send ETH to the syndicate treasury.

**Administrative/Emergency Functions (potentially limited or governed):**
10. `pauseSyndicate`: Allows a privileged address (initially owner, potentially governed) to pause certain contract functionalities (e.g., proposal execution, voting).
11. `unpauseSyndicate`: Allows unpausing the syndicate.

**View Functions (Read-Only):**
12. `getMemberInfo`: Retrieves details about a specific syndicate member (active status, reputation, delegation status).
13. `getProposalInfo`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific proposal (state, votes, deadlines, etc.).
14. `getGoalInfo`: Retrieves details about a specific collective goal defined by the syndicate.
15. `getSyndicateParameters`: Retrieves the current governance parameters (voting period, timelock, quorum).
16. `getTreasuryBalance`: Retrieves the current ETH balance held in the contract's treasury.
17. `getVotingPower`: Calculates and returns the effective voting power of a member at the current time, considering their own reputation and any delegations received/made.
18. `checkVoteStatus`: Provides a summary of the current vote counts and whether quorum/majority has been met for an active or succeeded proposal.
19. `getProposalQueue`: Lists or provides information about proposals currently in the timelock queue.
20. `viewProposalActions`: Retrieves the detailed list of actions associated with a specific proposal.
21. `isMember`: Checks if an address is a current active member of the syndicate.
22. `totalMembers`: Returns the total count of active syndicate members.
23. `totalProposals`: Returns the total number of proposals ever submitted.
24. `totalGoals`: Returns the total number of goals ever defined.
25. `getDelegate`: Returns the address the calling member has delegated their power to.
26. `getDelegators`: Returns the list of addresses that have delegated their power *to* a given member.

*(Note: Some functions like 'Add Member', 'Update Reputation', 'Set Goal', 'Withdraw ETH', 'Set Parameters' are not standalone public functions but are executed *as actions* within the `executeProposal` function, demonstrating the power of the generic action execution mechanism.)*

         // This sum still needs to be calculated or tracked.

         // Let's use a simplified, inefficient iteration for the example:
         // This requires iterating over keys of `members`, which isn't directly possible.
         // We would need a separate dynamic array `activeMembersList`.

         // Let's make a compromise for this example: Quorum is checked against the SUM of the reputations of ONLY those members who have *voted* (Yes or No) + an estimate. This is still not ideal.

         // Final Plan for Example Simplicity: Quorum is `yesVotes + noVotes` compared to a percentage of `_getTotalActiveReputation` which we *assume* is feasible or tracked elsewhere. We will *not* implement the internal loop here to avoid extreme inefficiency, but state the requirement.

         // This requires significant refactoring of the `Action` struct and `executeProposal`.
         // Let's reconsider the `Action` struct: it calls *external* targets.

         // Okay, let's add public functions that are *intended* to be called ONLY via `executeProposal`.
