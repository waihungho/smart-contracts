Okay, here is a smart contract concept called `ChronoVault`. It combines elements of timed access, dynamic withdrawal rules based on time-elapsed stages, deposit ownership transfer, and a penalty mechanism for early withdrawals. It aims to be more complex than a simple time-lock or standard vault.

It's designed to hold Ether and whitelisted ERC-20 tokens, managing access and withdrawal rules over predefined time-based stages.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract: ChronoVault**

*   **Purpose:** A time-gated vault for storing ETH and whitelisted ERC-20 tokens. Access to deposited funds and withdrawal rules change based on the time elapsed since the contract's deployment, moving through predefined "stages". Features include deposit ownership transfer and early withdrawal penalties.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Time-based Stages:** Contract transitions through different stages based on `block.timestamp`.
    *   **Dynamic Withdrawal Limits:** Withdrawal percentages are configured per stage.
    *   **Deposit Management:** Each deposit is tracked individually with its own ID, owner, asset, amount, initial lock, and withdrawal state.
    *   **Early Withdrawal Penalty:** Users can withdraw early before the minimum lock duration, but incur a penalty.
    *   **Deposit Ownership Transfer:** The right to manage a specific deposit can be transferred.
    *   **Pausable:** Standard security feature.

**Function Summary:**

**Admin & Configuration (Owner Only)**

1.  `pause()`: Pauses the contract, preventing deposits and withdrawals.
2.  `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract.
3.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
4.  `setMinimumLockDuration(uint256 duration)`: Sets the minimum time a deposit must be locked initially.
5.  `addWhitelistedToken(address token)`: Allows a specific ERC-20 token for deposits.
6.  `removeWhitelistedToken(address token)`: Disallows a specific ERC-20 token for deposits.
7.  `setStageTimings(uint256[] calldata timings)`: Defines the timestamp boundaries for each stage (relative to contract deployment). Must be increasing.
8.  `setWithdrawalLimitsForStage(uint256 stageIndex, uint256 limitPercentage)`: Sets the maximum percentage of the *initial* deposit amount that can be withdrawn cumulatively for a given stage (0-10000 for 0%-100%).
9.  `setEarlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate(uint256 rate)`: Sets the penalty rate (in basis points) for early withdrawals.
10. `setPenaltyRecipient(address recipient)`: Sets the address where early withdrawal penalties are sent.
11. `sweepExcessERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Recovers ERC-20 tokens sent to the contract that were *not* intended as vault deposits (e.g., mistaken transfers).

**User Deposit & Withdrawal**

12. `depositETH()`: Deposits ETH into the vault. Creates a new deposit entry. Requires `payable`.
13. `depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Deposits whitelisted ERC-20 tokens. Requires prior `approve`. Creates a new deposit entry.
14. `withdrawETH(uint256 depositId, uint256 amount)`: Withdraws ETH from a specific deposit. Subject to time lock, stage limits, and ownership checks.
15. `withdrawERC20(uint256 depositId, uint256 amount)`: Withdraws ERC-20 tokens from a specific deposit. Subject to time lock, stage limits, and ownership checks.
16. `initiateEarlyWithdrawal(uint256 depositId)`: Flags a deposit for early withdrawal calculation.
17. `claimEarlyWithdrawal(uint256 depositId)`: Executes the early withdrawal, applying the penalty and transferring the remaining amount. Only callable after `initiateEarlyWithdrawal`.
18. `extendLockDuration(uint256 depositId, uint256 additionalDuration)`: Allows extending the minimum lock time for a deposit.
19. `transferDepositOwnership(uint256 depositId, address newOwner)`: Transfers the right to manage a specific deposit to another address.

**Read & Query Functions**

20. `getCurrentStage()`: Returns the index of the current stage based on elapsed time.
21. `getDepositDetails(uint256 depositId)`: Returns details of a specific deposit.
22. `getUserDepositIds(address user)`: Returns an array of deposit IDs owned by a user.
23. `getWithdrawableAmount(uint256 depositId)`: Calculates the maximum amount currently available for withdrawal for a specific deposit, considering stage limits and prior withdrawals. Does *not* consider early withdrawal.
24. `getPenaltyAmount(uint256 depositId)`: Calculates the penalty amount if early withdrawal were to be claimed *now*.
25. `isWhitelistedToken(address token)`: Checks if an ERC-20 token is whitelisted.
26. `getMinimumLockDuration()`: Returns the current minimum lock duration.
27. `getStageTimings()`: Returns the array of stage timing boundaries.
28. `getWithdrawalLimitForStage(uint256 stageIndex)`: Returns the withdrawal limit percentage for a given stage.
29. `getEarlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate()`: Returns the current early withdrawal penalty rate.
30. `getPenaltyRecipient()`: Returns the address receiving penalties.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Time-Based Stages & Dynamic Withdrawal Limits:** The contract doesn't just have a single unlock time. It moves through predefined stages (`stageTimings`). Each stage can have a different `withdrawalLimit`, allowing for schemes like:
    *   Stage 0 (Initial Lock): 0% withdrawal
    *   Stage 1 (Partial Unlock): 25% cumulative withdrawal
    *   Stage 2 (Further Unlock): 60% cumulative withdrawal
    *   Stage 3 (Full Unlock): 100% cumulative withdrawal
    This creates a dynamic release schedule controlled by the contract's age.
2.  **Deposit Ownership Transfer:** The `transferDepositOwnership` function allows the *right* to manage a specific deposit (including withdrawals, extensions) to be transferred to another address, independent of the contract owner. This could represent transferring a time-locked asset or a claim right. *Note: The implementation of removing the deposit ID from the old owner's `userDepositIds` array is simplified and would need refinement for production use to maintain accurate lists.*
3.  **Early Withdrawal Penalty:** Users are incentivized to respect the `minimumLockDuration` and stage timings. `initiateEarlyWithdrawal` and `claimEarlyWithdrawal` provide an escape hatch, but at the cost of a percentage penalty on the remaining balance, which is redirected to a specified `penaltyRecipient`.
4.  **Individual Deposit Tracking:** Each deposit gets a unique ID and its own set of parameters (`amount`, `lockUntilTimestamp`, `withdrawnAmount`). This allows for granular control and tracking, rather than just a single balance per user.
5.  **Combined Asset Handling:** The vault handles both native ETH and whitelisted ERC-20 tokens within the same structure, abstracting away the asset type for core logic like withdrawal limits and penalties.

This contract goes beyond basic time-locks or simple vaults by introducing lifecycle stages, dynamic rules, penalty mechanics, and transferable claim rights, making it a more interesting and advanced pattern. It meets the criteria of having well over 20 functions.
