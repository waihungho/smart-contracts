Okay, here is a smart contract concept called `QuantumVault`. This contract combines the idea of a secure vault with a "quantum-inspired" state mechanism where the unlock condition becomes fixed ("measured") based on a future, somewhat unpredictable event (the hash of a future block).

It incorporates:
1.  **Multi-asset storage:** Holds ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens.
2.  **Quantum-inspired states:** `Created`, `Superpositioned`, `Measured`, `Unlocked`.
3.  **Conditional Unlock:** Unlock depends on fulfilling a condition that is determined *after* the vault is "superpositioned".
4.  **Pseudo-randomness:** Uses a future block hash to "measure" and select the true unlock condition from a set of possibilities.
5.  **Multiple Unlock Conditions:** Allows setting several potential conditions, only one of which becomes active.
6.  **State Transitions:** Enforces a specific lifecycle for each vault.
7.  **Emergency Withdrawal:** Owner bypass mechanism.
8.  **Protocol Fees:** Simple fee mechanism on withdrawals.
9.  **View Functions:** Comprehensive views into vault state and contents.
10. **ERC Standard Interaction:** Interacts with ERC20 and ERC721 interfaces.

It aims to be distinct from typical escrow, time-lock, or multi-sig contracts by introducing the non-deterministic (from the perspective of setting the condition) measurement phase.

**QuantumVault Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Contract owner, protocol fee settings, vault counter, mapping for vaults, mapping for owner vault IDs.
2.  **Structs:** `UnlockCondition` (defines parameters for a condition), `Vault` (holds vault data: state, assets, conditions, etc.).
3.  **Enums:** `VaultState`, `ConditionType`.
4.  **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `onlyVaultOwner`, `whenState`.
5.  **Events:** `VaultCreated`, `AssetsDeposited`, `ConditionAdded`, `ConditionRemoved`, `VaultSuperpositioned`, `VaultMeasured`, `VaultUnlocked`, `EmergencyWithdrawal`, `VaultOwnershipTransferred`, `ProtocolFeeRecipientUpdated`, `ProtocolFeeRateUpdated`, `ProtocolFeesWithdrawn`, `MeasurementDeadlineUpdated`.
6.  **Constructor:** Initializes contract owner.
7.  **Core Vault Management:** `createVault`, `superpositionVault`, `measureVault`, `unlockVault`, `cancelSuperposition`, `emergencyWithdrawOwner`, `transferVaultOwnership`, `renounceVaultOwnership`.
8.  **Asset Deposit Functions:** `depositETH`, `depositERC20`, `depositERC721`. (Can be called by anyone *before* superposition).
9.  **Unlock Condition Management:** `addUnlockCondition`, `removeUnlockCondition`, `updateMeasurementDeadline`. (Vault owner, in `Created` state).
10. **Protocol Fee Management:** `setProtocolFeeRecipient`, `setProtocolFeeRate`, `withdrawProtocolFees`. (Contract owner or Fee Recipient).
11. **View Functions:** `getVaultState`, `getVaultDetails`, `getUnlockConditions`, `getMeasuredConditionId`, `getVaultETHBalance`, `getVaultERC20Balance`, `getVaultERC721Count`, `getVaultERC721Tokens`, `checkCondition`, `checkMeasuredCondition`, `getVaultIdsByOwner`, `getProtocolFeeRecipient`, `getProtocolFeeRate`, `getProtocolFeesAccumulated`.
12. **Receive/Fallback:** Handles direct ETH transfers (collected as protocol fees).
13. **Internal Helpers:** `_checkCondition`, `_transferETH`, `_transferERC20`, `_transferERC721`.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Deploys the contract, setting the initial contract owner.
2.  `createVault()`: Creates a new vault entry in the `Created` state, assigning ownership to the caller.
3.  `depositETH(uint256 _vaultId)`: Allows depositing ETH into a specific vault (must be in `Created` state). Requires sending ETH with the call.
4.  `depositERC20(uint256 _vaultId, address _token, uint256 _amount)`: Allows depositing a specified amount of an ERC20 token into a vault (must be in `Created` state). Requires prior approval (`approve`) of the contract by the token owner.
5.  `depositERC721(uint256 _vaultId, address _token, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows depositing a specific ERC721 token into a vault (must be in `Created` state). Requires prior approval (`approve` or `setApprovalForAll`) of the contract by the token owner.
6.  `addUnlockCondition(uint256 _vaultId, ConditionType _type, uint256 _blockNumberParam, bytes32 _bytes32Param, address _addressParam, bool _boolParam)`: Allows the vault owner to add a potential unlock condition to a vault (must be in `Created` state).
7.  `removeUnlockCondition(uint256 _vaultId, uint256 _conditionId)`: Allows the vault owner to remove a condition by its ID (must be in `Created` state). Conditions are marked invalid rather than removed from the array.
8.  `superpositionVault(uint256 _vaultId, uint256 _measurementTargetBlock, uint256 _measurementDeadlineBlock)`: Transitions the vault from `Created` to `Superpositioned` state. Requires at least one condition. Sets the target block whose hash will be used for measurement and a deadline for when measurement must occur. Vault contents and conditions are locked.
9.  `measureVault(uint256 _vaultId)`: Transitions the vault from `Superpositioned` to `Measured` state. Callable by anyone *after* the `_measurementTargetBlock` but *before* the `_measurementDeadlineBlock` AND within the last 256 blocks relative to the `_measurementTargetBlock` (due to `blockhash` limitations). Uses `blockhash(_measurementTargetBlock)` to pseudo-randomly select one of the added conditions as the *true* unlock condition.
10. `unlockVault(uint256 _vaultId)`: Attempts to unlock the vault. Callable by anyone *after* the vault is in the `Measured` state. Succeeds only if the *measured* unlock condition is currently met based on the state of the blockchain and the caller. Transfers all deposited assets to the vault owner (minus protocol fees).
11. `cancelSuperposition(uint256 _vaultId)`: Allows the vault owner to revert a vault from `Superpositioned` back to `Created` state, losing the configured conditions (they must be added again). Useful if the measurement parameters need adjustment or the owner changes their mind before measurement.
12. `emergencyWithdrawOwner(uint256 _vaultId)`: Allows the vault owner to immediately withdraw all assets from a vault, regardless of its state or conditions. This bypasses the normal unlock flow and is subject to a higher protocol fee.
13. `transferVaultOwnership(uint256 _vaultId, address _newOwner)`: Allows the current vault owner to transfer ownership of a vault to another address (only allowed in `Created` or `Superpositioned` states).
14. `renounceVaultOwnership(uint256 _vaultId)`: Allows the current vault owner to renounce ownership of a vault, transferring ownership to the zero address (effectively locking assets forever unless emergency withdrawal is used beforehand).
15. `setProtocolFeeRecipient(address _recipient)`: (Contract owner only) Sets the address that receives protocol fees.
16. `setProtocolFeeRate(uint256 _rate)`: (Contract owner only) Sets the protocol fee rate (in basis points, 0-10000) for successful unlocks.
17. `withdrawProtocolFees(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: (Protocol Fee Recipient only) Allows the fee recipient to withdraw accumulated protocol fees for a specific token or ETH.
18. `getVaultState(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Returns the current state of a vault.
19. `getVaultDetails(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Returns basic details about a vault (owner, creation block, state, target block, deadline).
20. `getUnlockConditions(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Returns the list of potential unlock conditions set for a vault.
21. `getMeasuredConditionId(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Returns the ID of the condition that was selected during measurement (if in `Measured` state).
22. `getVaultETHBalance(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Returns the ETH balance held within a specific vault.
23. `getVaultERC20Balance(uint256 _vaultId, address _token)`: (View) Returns the balance of a specific ERC20 token held within a vault.
24. `getVaultERC721Count(uint256 _vaultId, address _token)`: (View) Returns the count of ERC721 tokens of a specific type held within a vault.
25. `getVaultERC721Tokens(uint256 _vaultId, address _token)`: (View) Returns the list of token IDs for a specific ERC721 token type held within a vault. *Caution: Can be gas-intensive for many tokens.*
26. `checkCondition(uint256 _vaultId, uint256 _conditionId)`: (View) Checks if a *specific* condition (by ID) on a vault *is currently met*. Useful for testing conditions before measurement.
27. `checkMeasuredCondition(uint256 _vaultId)`: (View) Checks if the *measured* unlock condition for a vault is *currently met*.
28. `getVaultIdsByOwner(address _owner)`: (View) Returns a list of vault IDs owned by a given address. *Caution: Can be gas-intensive for owners with many vaults.*
29. `getProtocolFeeRecipient()`: (View) Returns the current protocol fee recipient.
30. `getProtocolFeeRate()`: (View) Returns the current protocol fee rate.
31. `getProtocolFeesAccumulated(address _token)`: (View) Returns the amount of accumulated protocol fees for a specific token (or the contract's direct ETH balance).
32. `receive()`: Payable fallback function to accept direct ETH transfers, adding them to the contract's general ETH balance (considered protocol fees).
33. `fallback()`: Non-payable fallback function (reverts).
