Okay, let's design a smart contract around a concept that leverages aspects of decentralized verification, reputation, and potentially AI evaluation â€“ something beyond a standard oracle or token.

How about a **Decentralized AI Model Evaluation & Verification Platform**?

The core idea is to create a protocol where users can submit data outputs from AI models (or any complex data needing verification), other participants (Validators/Jurors) stake tokens to evaluate these outputs, and disputes are resolved on-chain. This involves staking, slashing, decentralized voting/consensus, and managing data submissions/requests through various lifecycle stages.

This isn't just fetching a price; it's verifying potentially subjective or complex data outputs based on staked consensus.

## Smart Contract: DecentralizedAIOracle

**Outline:**

1.  **Purpose:** Facilitates decentralized submission, evaluation, and verification of complex data outputs (potentially from AI models) using a stake-based consensus and dispute mechanism.
2.  **Participants:**
    *   `Requester`: User who needs data verified, pays a fee.
    *   `Submitter`: Provides the data output, stakes tokens.
    *   `Evaluator`: Verifies submissions during the validation phase, stakes tokens.
    *   `Juror`: Participates in dispute resolution voting, stakes tokens.
    *   `Owner`: Admin, can set configurations, pause.
3.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Staking:** Participants stake a specific ERC20 token to gain roles (`Submitter`, `Evaluator`, `Juror`).
    *   **Request Lifecycle:** Requests go through phases: Open, Submission, Evaluation, Dispute, Settlement.
    *   **Submission:** Submitters provide data and stake for each submission.
    *   **Evaluation:** Evaluators mark submissions as Valid or Invalid during the Evaluation phase.
    *   **Dispute:** Initiated by Evaluators (or others) on submissions marked 'Invalid' (or potentially 'Valid' if challenged). Requires a dispute bond.
    *   **Dispute Resolution:** Jurors vote on the validity of a disputed submission.
    *   **Settlement:** After phases, winning submissions/evaluations/votes are determined, rewards distributed, and losing stakes/bonds slashed.
    *   **Reputation (Implicit/Future):** Success/failure in participation could inform off-chain reputation.
    *   **Configurability:** Admin can set parameters like phase durations, minimum stakes, fees, slashing percentages.
4.  **Token:** Uses a designated ERC20 token for staking, fees, and rewards.

**Function Summary (25 Functions):**

**Admin Functions:**
1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract with ERC20 token address and owner.
2.  `updateConfig`: Updates various protocol parameters (min stakes, phase durations, fees, slashing).
3.  `pauseContract`: Pauses the contract in emergencies.
4.  `unpauseContract`: Unpauses the contract.
5.  `withdrawAdminFees`: Owner withdraws accumulated protocol fees.

**Staking Functions:**
6.  `stakeAsSubmitter`: Stakes tokens to become a Submitter.
7.  `stakeAsEvaluator`: Stakes tokens to become an Evaluator.
8.  `stakeAsJuror`: Stakes tokens to become a Juror.
9.  `requestUnstakeSubmitter`: Initiates unstaking for Submitter role (subject to cooldown).
10. `requestUnstakeEvaluator`: Initiates unstaking for Evaluator role (subject to cooldown).
11. `requestUnstakeJuror`: Initiates unstaking for Juror role (subject to cooldown).
12. `claimUnstaked`: Claims tokens after the unstaking cooldown period ends.

**Request Management Functions:**
13. `createDataRequest`: Allows a Requester to create a new data verification request, paying a fee.
14. `cancelDataRequest`: Allows the Requester to cancel an open request before submissions start.

**Data Submission & Evaluation Functions:**
15. `submitData`: Allows a staked Submitter to submit data for an open request, staking per submission.
16. `evaluateSubmission`: Allows a staked Evaluator to mark a submitted data point as valid or invalid during the Evaluation phase.

**Dispute & Voting Functions:**
17. `startDispute`: Allows an Evaluator (or potentially Juror/Submitter depending on configuration) to start a dispute on a specific submission, staking a dispute bond.
18. `submitVote`: Allows a staked Juror to vote on the validity of a disputed submission.
19. `finalizeDisputeVoting`: Concludes the voting period for a dispute and tallies votes.

**Settlement & Claiming Functions:**
20. `processRequestSettlement`: Triggered after phases end. Determines the winning data (based on evaluation/dispute outcomes), calculates rewards/slashing, and makes funds claimable.
21. `claimSubmitterRewards`: Allows a Submitter to claim earned rewards from settled requests.
22. `claimEvaluatorRewards`: Allows an Evaluator to claim earned rewards from settled requests.
23. `claimJurorRewards`: Allows a Juror to claim earned rewards from settled disputes.
24. `claimDisputeBondRefund`: Allows a disputer to claim back their bond if the dispute outcome favors them.
25. `penalizeInactiveJuror`: Allows anyone to trigger slashing for Jurors who failed to vote in a dispute they were eligible for.

**View Functions (Not included in the count of 25, but essential):**
*   `getRequestDetails`: Get details of a specific request.
*   `getSubmissionDetails`: Get details of a specific submission.
*   `getStakeDetails`: Get stake amounts and unstake status for an address and role.
*   `getDisputeDetails`: Get details of a specific dispute.
*   `getClaimableRewards`: Check claimable reward balance for an address and role.
