The `SynapticVault` is a cutting-edge decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that leverages a network of AI oracles ("Neural Delegates") to inform and potentially automate its asset management strategies. It introduces the concept of dynamic "Autonomy Levels" for its "Synaptic Core," allowing the DAO to gradually empower or restrain the influence of AI-driven proposals based on performance and trust. The contract aims to provide a framework for adaptive, sentiment-driven treasury management, where human governance and decentralized AI insights collaboratively steer the protocol's direction.

**Function Summary:**

**I. Core Infrastructure & Governance:**
1.  `constructor(address _synapseTokenAddress, uint256 _initialMinDelegateStake, uint256 _initialProposalThreshold, uint256 _initialVotingPeriod, uint256 _initialTimelockDelay)`: Initializes the contract with necessary token addresses and governance parameters.
2.  `updateCoreParameters(uint256 _newMinDelegateStake, uint256 _newProposalThreshold, uint256 _newVotingPeriod, uint256 _newTimelockDelay)`: Allows governance to update core protocol parameters.
3.  `depositAssets(address _asset, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users or the DAO to deposit specific ERC20 assets into the vault.
4.  `initiateWithdrawal(address _asset, uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`: Initiates a governance-approved withdrawal of assets from the vault.
5.  `getVaultBalance(address _asset)`: Returns the current balance of a specific asset held by the vault.
6.  `propose(bytes[] calldata _targets, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes[] calldata _callDatas, string calldata _description)`: Allows token holders to submit a new governance proposal.
7.  `vote(uint256 _proposalId, uint8 _support)`: Allows token holders to cast their vote on an active proposal.
8.  `queue(uint256 _proposalId)`: Queues an approved proposal after the voting period, subject to a timelock.
9.  `execute(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has passed voting and timelock.
10. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal (e.g., Pending, Active, Succeeded, Executed).

**II. Neural Delegate Network:**
11. `registerNeuralDelegate(bytes32 _delegateIdentifier)`: Allows a user to stake `minDelegateStake` SynapseTokens and register as a Neural Delegate, providing a unique identifier for their off-chain AI.
12. `deregisterNeuralDelegate()`: Allows a registered delegate to unstake their tokens and exit the network, provided no active challenges or pending reports.
13. `submitNeuralReport(uint256 _sentimentScore, bytes32 _reportHash)`: Delegates submit their AI's sentiment score (an integer representation of market sentiment or a specific indicator) and a verifiable `_reportHash` for later proof.
14. `challengeNeuralReport(address _delegate, bytes32 _reportHash)`: Allows any token holder to challenge a submitted neural report, initiating a dispute resolution process.
15. `resolveChallenge(address _delegate, bytes32 _reportHash, bool _isValid)`: An authorized entity (e.g., governance multi-sig) resolves a challenge, potentially slashing the delegate's stake if the report was invalid.
16. `claimDelegateRewards()`: Delegates can claim their accrued rewards for submitting valid reports.
17. `getNeuralDelegatePerformanceScore(address _delegate)`: Returns a delegate's accumulated performance score, impacting their influence on the `SentimentPulse`.
18. `updateNeuralDelegateStakeRequirement(uint256 _newMinStake)`: Governance can update the minimum stake required for Neural Delegates.

**III. Synaptic Core (Adaptive Intelligence Logic):**
19. `getAggregatedSentimentPulse()`: Calculates and returns the current aggregated sentiment score based on recent, valid Neural Reports and delegate performance.
20. `adjustAutonomyLevel(AutonomyLevel _newLevel)`: Governance sets the Synaptic Core's autonomy level (e.g., Advisory, SemiAutonomous, FullyAutonomous for specific actions).
21. `generateStrategyProposal(bytes32 _strategyHash)`: Callable by the Synaptic Core itself (if `autonomyLevel` allows) or governance to propose a new strategy, leveraging `_aggregatedSentimentPulse` implicitly. The `_strategyHash` represents the details of the proposed strategy.

**IV. Strategy Execution:**
22. `executeStrategyReconfiguration(bytes32 _strategyHash)`: Implements an approved asset management strategy (defined by `_strategyHash`), rebalancing assets within the vault. This function would interact with external DEXs/AMMs in a real-world scenario (simplified here).
23. `getCurrentStrategy()`: Returns the `bytes32` hash representing the currently active asset management strategy.

**V. Utilities & Security:**
24. `pause()`: Pauses critical functions in case of emergency.
25. `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract after an emergency.
