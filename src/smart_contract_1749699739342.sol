Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a complex Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) centered around the collective curation, ownership, and dynamic fractionalization of digital assets (like NFTs). This incorporates governance, asset management, staking, and unique mechanics for handling fractionalized ownership.

We will *simulate* some external interactions (like creating new ERC-20 tokens for shares) for demonstration purposes within a single contract structure, or use interfaces to represent interaction with hypothetical external contracts (like real ERC-721s and dynamically deployed share tokens).

**Contract Name:** CurationDAO

**Core Concept:** A DAO where members (token holders) stake governance tokens ($CURATE) to gain voting power and propose/vote on acquiring, selling, or fractionalizing/de-fractionalizing valuable digital assets (NFTs). Revenue from asset sales or other sources is distributed among stakers.

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Description:** Overview of the CurationDAO's purpose and mechanics.
2.  **Interfaces:** Define necessary interfaces (ERC721, and a minimal Share Token interface).
3.  **Libraries:** (None required for basic logic, but might use SafeMath or similar in a real scenario).
4.  **Errors:** Custom error types for clarity.
5.  **Events:** Events for state changes and actions.
6.  **Structs:** Data structures for Proposals, Assets, Stakers.
7.  **Enums:** Define states for Assets and Proposals, types for Proposals.
8.  **State Variables:** Mappings and variables to track assets, proposals, votes, staking data, parameters.
9.  **Modifiers:** Access control modifiers.
10. **Constructor:** Initialize the contract (e.g., mint initial DAO tokens).
11. **Core DAO Token (Minimal Implementation):** Basic balance tracking and transfer (or assume an external ERC20). Let's do a minimal internal one for this example.
12. **Staking & Rewards:** Functions for staking, unstaking, claiming rewards, distributing revenue.
13. **Governance:** Functions for creating proposals, voting, delegation, queueing, executing, and cancelling proposals.
14. **Asset Management:** Functions (primarily internal, triggered by governance) for acquiring, releasing, and managing the state of owned assets.
15. **Fractionalization Logic (Simulated/Interfaced):** Functions to propose/execute fractionalization and de-fractionalization, interacting with hypothetical fractional share tokens.
16. **Parameter Management:** Functions (triggered by governance) to update DAO parameters.
17. **View Functions:** Read-only functions to query contract state.

**Function Summary:**

*   **DAO Token (Internal):**
    *   `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer DAO tokens.
    *   `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer DAO tokens from allowance (basic).
    *   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approve spending (basic).
    *   `balanceOf(address account)`: Get token balance.
    *   `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Get allowance.
    *   `totalSupply()`: Get total supply.
*   **Staking & Rewards:**
    *   `stake(uint256 amount)`: Stake DAO tokens to gain voting power and earn rewards.
    *   `unstake(uint256 amount)`: Unstake DAO tokens.
    *   `claimRewards()`: Claim accumulated staking rewards.
    *   `distributeAssetSaleRevenue(uint256 amount)`: (Governance-only) Distribute revenue from asset sales to the reward pool.
    *   `getStakedBalance(address account)`: Get amount staked by an account.
    *   `getPendingRewards(address account)`: Get pending rewards for an account.
*   **Governance:**
    *   `delegate(address delegatee)`: Delegate voting power.
    *   `getVotingPower(address account)`: Get current voting power (based on staked amount or delegation).
    *   `propose(string description, address target, uint256 value, bytes callData, ProposalType proposalType)`: Create a new governance proposal.
    *   `vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Cast a vote on a proposal.
    *   `queueProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Move a successful proposal to the execution queue (adds a delay).
    *   `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Execute a proposal after the queue delay.
    *   `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancel a proposal (e.g., by proposer before voting ends, or governance).
    *   `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Get the current state of a proposal.
    *   `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Get details of a proposal.
*   **Asset Management & Fractionalization:**
    *   `acquireAsset(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: (Internal, called by `executeProposal`) Accepts transfer of an NFT the DAO proposed to acquire.
    *   `releaseAsset(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, address recipient)`: (Internal, called by `executeProposal`) Transfers an owned NFT out (e.g., after sale or de-fractionalization).
    *   `executeFractionalization(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, address fractionalShareTokenAddress, uint256 totalShares)`: (Internal, called by `executeProposal`) Locks NFT, records share token address, potentially mints shares.
    *   `executeDeFractionalization(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: (Internal, called by `executeProposal`) Requires all shares to be held by the DAO (or a designated address), burns shares, releases NFT.
    *   `getAssetDAOState(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Get the state of an asset owned or managed by the DAO.
    *   `getFractionalShareToken(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Get the address of the share token for a fractionalized asset.
*   **View Functions (General):**
    *   `getCurrentParameters()`: Get current DAO governance parameters.
    *   `getTotalStaked()`: Get the total amount of DAO tokens staked.

        // Or, simpler: `getVotingPower(voter)` returns `stakers[voter].stakedAmount`. `vote` is called by the delegate, and implicitly uses their delegated power.

        // Let's use the Governor standard model: getVotes(address account) returns the amount of tokens the account *can vote with*.
        // This amount is: the account's own staked balance + balances of others who delegated *to* this account.
        // This requires tracking delegations *to* addresses.

        // Tracking incoming delegations requires iteration or a separate mapping which can be gas-intensive.
        // Let's revert to the simplest model for demonstration: Voting Power = Staked Amount.
        // Delegation *only* affects *who* can call the `vote` function on behalf of that staked amount.

        // With the minimal internal token:
        // Option 1: Voting Power = Staked Balance. Delegate votes on behalf of staker.
        // Option 2: Voting Power = Staked Balance + non-staked Balance delegated TO this address. (Requires tracking incoming delegations)

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Integrated Staking & Governance:** Staking `$CURATE` tokens is the *only* way to gain voting power (`getVotingPower` returns staked balance). This aligns incentives – only active, committed members govern. Stakers also earn revenue generated by the DAO's asset management activities.
2.  **Dynamic Asset Fractionalization (Simulated):** The DAO can propose and execute the fractionalization of an owned NFT. This process involves locking the NFT and associating it with a specific `IAssetShareToken` address (simulated). Governance also handles the complex process of de-fractionalization, requiring all shares to be re-consolidated before the NFT can be released.
3.  **Multi-Type Governance Proposals:** The `propose` function handles distinct types of actions (acquire, sell, fractionalize, de-fractionalize, parameter change, yield distribution). This makes the DAO capable of diverse operations through a single governance interface.
4.  **Queued Execution:** Successful proposals enter a `Queued` state for a `queueDelay` period before becoming `Executable`. This common DAO pattern provides a safety window for users or external systems to react if a malicious or unfavorable proposal passes.
5.  **State-Dependent Logic:** Functions like `vote`, `executeProposal`, `queueProposal`, `getProposalState`, `getAssetDAOState`, and `getFractionalShareToken` rely heavily on the current state of proposals and assets, enforcing logical transitions and access control based on the DAO's lifecycle and asset status.
6.  **Revenue Distribution to Stakers:** The `distributeAssetSaleRevenue` function (intended to be called via governance execution) adds funds to a shared reward pool, claimable by stakers proportionally to their stake amount and duration since the last distribution/claim (`rewardPerTokenScaled`). This is a simple yield-farming-like mechanic integrated into the governance structure.
7.  **Delegation (Simplified):** While the voting power model is simplified (staked balance), the `delegate` function allows stakers to assign *who* can cast votes on their behalf, which is a core component of scalable DAOs.
8.  **Internal Token Management (Minimal):** Implementing the DAO token balances and transfers directly within the DAO contract (minimally, not full ERC20 standard inheritence) allows for tighter coupling between token state and DAO logic (like updating voting power on transfers).
9.  **Asset Management Lifecycle:** The contract tracks the state of specific NFTs (`AssetState`) it owns or manages (`OwnedByDAO`, `Fractionalized`, `PendingSale`), enabling governance actions appropriate to each state.
10. **Parameter Governance:** The DAO can vote to change its own core parameters (`votingPeriod`, `quorum`, `proposalThreshold`, `queueDelay`), providing adaptability and self-amendment capability.

This contract provides a blueprint for a sophisticated, asset-managing DAO, combining several advanced concepts beyond simple token transfers or basic voting. Note that for a production system, significant enhancements would be needed, including more robust error handling, gas optimizations, potentially using established libraries like OpenZeppelin for ERC-20/ERC-721 interactions and a more complete Governor implementation, rigorous security audits, and potentially a factory contract for deploying actual ERC-20 share tokens.
