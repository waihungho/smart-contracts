/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - Creative and Advanced Concepts)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts
 *      like dynamic pricing, fractional ownership, curated exhibitions, artist reputation, and community governance.
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  Artwork Management:
 *     - mintArtwork(string memory _artworkCID, string memory _metadataCID, uint256 _initialPrice): Allows artists to mint new artworks as NFTs.
 *     - listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price): Artists can list their artworks for sale.
 *     - buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Collectors can purchase listed artworks.
 *     - removeArtworkFromSale(uint256 _artworkId): Artists can remove their artwork from sale.
 *     - transferArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address _to): Artwork owners can transfer their artworks.
 *     - getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): Retrieves detailed information about an artwork.
 *
 * 2.  Fractional Ownership:
 *     - fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions): Allows artwork owners to fractionalize their artwork into ERC20 tokens.
 *     - buyFraction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount): Allows users to buy fractions of a fractionalized artwork.
 *     - redeemFractionalArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows holders of a majority of fractions to initiate the redemption of the physical/original artwork (governance vote required).
 *
 * 3.  Curated Exhibitions:
 *     - createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _submissionDeadline, uint256 _votingDeadline, uint256 _exhibitionStartTime): Curators can propose new exhibitions.
 *     - submitArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId): Artists can submit their artworks to open exhibitions.
 *     - voteOnExhibitionSubmission(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve): Curators can vote on submitted artworks for exhibitions.
 *     - finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): After voting, finalizes the exhibition and selects artworks.
 *     - getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): Retrieves details about a specific exhibition.
 *
 * 4.  Artist Reputation & Staking:
 *     - stakeForReputation(uint256 _artworkId): Artwork owners can stake tokens to boost the reputation of the artwork/artist (governance dependent on reputation system implementation - placeholder).
 *     - getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress): Retrieves the reputation score of an artist (placeholder reputation system).
 *
 * 5.  Dynamic Pricing & Auctions (Simple):
 *     - setDynamicPricing(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _floorPrice, uint256 _priceDecayRate): Artists can set dynamic pricing for their artwork (price decreases over time).
 *     - getDynamicPrice(uint256 _artworkId): Retrieves the current dynamic price of an artwork.
 *     - startAuction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _startingBid, uint256 _auctionDuration): Starts a simple English auction for an artwork.
 *     - bidOnAuction(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to bid in an ongoing auction.
 *     - finalizeAuction(uint256 _artworkId): Ends the auction and transfers artwork to the highest bidder.
 *
 * 6.  Community Governance (Basic):
 *     - proposeGalleryParameterChange(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue): Community members can propose changes to gallery parameters.
 *     - voteOnParameterChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve): Community members can vote on parameter change proposals.
 *     - executeParameterChange(uint256 _proposalId): Executes approved parameter change proposals.
 *
 * 7.  Gallery Fees & Revenue Sharing:
 *     - setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Gallery owner can set the platform fee percentage.
 *     - withdrawGalleryFees(): Gallery owner can withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *     - distributeRevenueToFractionHolders(uint256 _artworkId): Distributes revenue (e.g., from sales, rentals - not implemented) to fraction holders of an artwork.
 *
 * 8.  Utility Functions:
 *     - getGalleryOwner(): Returns the address of the gallery owner.
 *     - getPlatformFeePercentage(): Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 *     - supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId): Standard ERC165 interface support.
