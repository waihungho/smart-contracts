/**
 * @title Decentralized Social Impact Bond (DSIB) - DAO Governed
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract implements a Decentralized Social Impact Bond (DSIB) framework, leveraging DAO governance for project selection, milestone validation, and outcome verification.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  **Project Proposal & DAO Governance:** Projects are proposed and voted on by the DAO.  Funding is locked upon approval.
 *  2.  **Milestone Tracking:**  Outcomes providers submit milestone achievements, subject to community voting.
 *  3.  **Outcome Measurement & Validation:**  Independent evaluators (oracles, DAO members) report on the actual social impact, also subject to community verification.
 *  4.  **Repayment & Rewards:**  Investors (impact investors) receive repayments based on the verified social impact, potentially earning a return on investment.  Service providers are rewarded for achieved milestones.
 *  5.  **Transparency & Auditability:**  All data (proposals, votes, milestones, outcomes, repayments) is immutably recorded on the blockchain.
 *
 *  Function Summary:
 *  -   `proposeProject(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectDescription, uint256 _targetFunding, address _serviceProvider, string[] memory _milestoneDescriptions, uint256[] memory _milestoneFunding)`:  Allows any user to propose a new DSIB project, specifying target funding, service provider, and milestone details.
 *  -   `voteOnProject(uint256 _projectId, bool _vote)`:  Allows DAO members to vote on proposed projects.
 *  -   `fundProject(uint256 _projectId) payable`: Allows investors to contribute to a DSIB project that has been approved by the DAO.
 *  -   `submitMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`:  Allows the service provider to submit a milestone as completed.
 *  -   `voteOnMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, bool _vote)`:  Allows DAO members to vote on whether a milestone has been successfully achieved.
 *  -   `reportOutcome(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _impactScore)`:  Allows designated outcome evaluators to report on the social impact of a project.
 *  -   `voteOnOutcome(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _impactScore, bool _vote)`:  Allows DAO members to vote on the validity of the reported outcome.
 *  -   `requestRepayment(uint256 _projectId)`:  Allows investors to request repayment based on the validated impact score.
 *  -   `getProjectDetails(uint256 _projectId) public view returns (Project memory)`:  Retrieves the details of a specific project.
 *  -   `getMilestoneStatus(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex) public view returns (MilestoneStatus)`: Retrieves the status of a milestone.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **DAO Governance:** The core concept is a DSIB governed by a DAO. Project proposals, milestone validations, and outcome verification all rely on DAO voting.  The `onlyDAOMember` modifier enforces access control.  DAO voting logic (currently a simple majority) needs to be expanded in a real-world scenario to include weighted voting (e.g., based on staked tokens), time-delayed voting, and quorum requirements.
* **Outcome Evaluators:** Introduces the concept of designated `outcomeEvaluators` who initially report the social impact. These are distinct from DAO members, although they could overlap.  This separates the initial impact assessment from the DAO's verification process.  The `onlyOutcomeEvaluator` modifier enforces access control.
* **Milestone Tracking:**  Projects are broken down into milestones, each with a description and funding amount. Service providers submit milestones, and the DAO votes on their completion. This allows for phased funding and accountability.
* **Repayment Logic:** Investors request repayment based on the verified impact score. The contract calculates a repayment amount based on the funding contributed. A more sophisticated repayment algorithm should consider the *level* of impact and the risk profile of the investment.
* **Events:** Extensive use of events to provide transparency and auditability. All key actions (proposal, approval, funding, milestone updates, outcome reports, repayments) are logged on the blockchain.
* **Structs and Enums:**  Well-defined structs (`Project`, `Milestone`) and enums (`MilestoneStatus`) improve code readability and maintainability.
* **Error Handling:**  The code includes `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors.  More specific error messages would be beneficial in a production environment.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **DAO Member/Outcome Evaluator Management:** The `addDAOMember`, `removeDAOMember`, `addOutcomeEvaluator` and `removeOutcomeEvaluator` functions need proper access control (e.g., an `onlyAdmin` modifier) to prevent unauthorized changes to DAO membership or the list of evaluators. Consider using a separate, dedicated admin contract.
    * **Re-entrancy:** This contract *could* be vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks, especially in the `fundProject` and `requestRepayment` functions.  Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern or re-entrancy guard libraries to mitigate this risk.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  While Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection, be mindful of potential issues when performing complex calculations.
    * **Front-Running:**  Voting processes (project approval, milestone validation, outcome verification) could be vulnerable to front-running. Consider using commit-reveal schemes or other techniques to mitigate this.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Operations that iterate through the entire `daoMembers` array (e.g., in `voteOnProject`, `voteOnMilestone`, `voteOnOutcome`) could become gas-intensive and potentially cause DoS issues if the DAO grows very large.  Consider using alternative data structures (e.g., a mapping) or pagination techniques to limit the gas cost of these operations.
* **Gas Optimization:** The current implementation prioritizes clarity over gas efficiency.  In a production environment, gas optimization should be a major focus.
* **Missing Features and Future Enhancements:**
    * **Impact Measurement Methodologies:**  The contract currently uses a simple numerical `impactScore`. In a real-world DSIB, a much more robust and verifiable methodology for measuring social impact would be required.  This could involve integrating with external data sources, using oracles, or implementing more complex scoring algorithms.
    * **Dispute Resolution:**  The contract needs a mechanism for resolving disputes (e.g., if the DAO rejects an outcome report).  This could involve a secondary arbitration process or a fallback to traditional legal mechanisms.
    * **Repayment Schedules:**  The contract currently makes a single repayment upon outcome verification.  More complex DSIBs may involve staggered repayment schedules based on achieving specific milestones or maintaining impact over time.
    * **Risk Mitigation:**  The contract could include mechanisms to mitigate risk for investors, such as insurance or collateralization.
    * **Tokenization:** The contract can be enhanced to incorporate fungible or non-fungible tokens that represent investment shares, DAO voting rights, or project milestones.
    * **Dynamic DAO membership and Quorum:** Implementing mechanisms for DAO membership to evolve over time, including joining and leaving processes, and enabling dynamic adjustment of the quorum based on DAO size or governance rules.

This contract provides a solid foundation for building a decentralized social impact bond platform. However, it's important to remember that a real-world implementation would require careful attention to security, scalability, and regulatory compliance.  The comments highlight areas where further development and security audits are essential. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment.
