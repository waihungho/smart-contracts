 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Art Gallery - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized dynamic art gallery, showcasing advanced concepts and creative functionalities.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Gallery Management:**
 *    - `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _curator)`: Initializes the gallery with a name and initial curator. (Once-only setup)
 *    - `setGalleryName(string _newName)`: Allows the curator to change the gallery name.
 *    - `getGalleryName()`: Retrieves the current gallery name.
 *    - `getCurator()`: Retrieves the address of the current gallery curator.
 *    - `transferCuratorship(address _newCurator)`: Allows the current curator to transfer curatorship to a new address.
 *
 * **2. Dynamic Art NFT Integration (Assuming external ERC721/ERC1155):**
 *    - `setArtNFTContract(address _nftContract)`: Sets the address of the external NFT contract (ERC721 or ERC1155) that represents art pieces.
 *    - `getArtNFTContract()`: Retrieves the address of the linked NFT contract.
 *    - `registerArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the owner of an NFT from the linked contract to register it in the gallery.
 *    - `unregisterArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the owner to unregister their NFT from the gallery.
 *    - `isArtNFTRegistered(uint256 _tokenId)`: Checks if an NFT is registered in the gallery.
 *    - `getRegisteredArtNFTs()`: Retrieves a list of all registered NFT token IDs in the gallery.
 *
 * **3. Exhibition & Curation Features:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _description)`: Curator function to create a new exhibition.
 *    - `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Curator function to add a registered NFT to an exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Curator function to remove an NFT from an exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition (name, description, art pieces).
 *    - `listActiveExhibitions()`: Retrieves a list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **4. Dynamic Metadata & Interactive Art (Advanced Concept):**
 *    - `setDynamicMetadataFunction(uint256 _tokenId, bytes4 _functionSelector)`:  **Creative & Advanced:** Allows the curator to associate a *function selector* from THIS CONTRACT with a registered NFT. This function will be called to generate *dynamic metadata* for the NFT when requested.
 *    - `getDynamicMetadataFunction(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the function selector associated with an NFT for dynamic metadata generation.
 *    - `generateDynamicMetadata(uint256 _tokenId)`: **Internal/View Function:**  This function (if a selector is set) is called to generate dynamic metadata based on the associated function.  This is an example - specific implementation will vary.
 *
 * **5. Community Interaction & Voting (Trendy DAO-like concept, simplified):**
 *    - `proposeExhibitionTheme(string _themeProposal)`: Allows any user to propose a new exhibition theme.
 *    - `voteForThemeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows users to vote for a proposed exhibition theme.
 *    - `getThemeProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the vote count for a specific theme proposal.
 *    - `listThemeProposals()`: Retrieves a list of all theme proposal IDs.
 *    - `implementThemeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Curator function to implement a theme proposal (e.g., create an exhibition based on it) if it reaches a voting threshold (threshold logic not implemented here for simplicity, but can be added).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Dynamic Metadata (`setDynamicMetadataFunction`, `getDynamicMetadataFunction`, `generateDynamicMetadata`):**
    *   **Concept:** This is the most advanced and creative feature. It allows the curator to link specific NFTs registered in the gallery to functions *within the smart contract itself*. These functions are designed to generate metadata *dynamically*.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   `setDynamicMetadataFunction`: The curator uses this to associate an NFT (identified by its `tokenId`) with a specific function in the contract using its `function selector` (the first 4 bytes of the function's signature hash).
        *   `generateDynamicMetadata`: This function is a placeholder and example. In a real implementation:
            *   When an external application (like a frontend gallery display) wants to get metadata for an NFT, it might call a function like `getArtNFTMetadataURI(_tokenId)`.
            *   `getArtNFTMetadataURI` would first check if a dynamic metadata function is set for that `_tokenId`.
            *   If a function selector is set, `getArtNFTMetadataURI` would use `delegatecall` (or a similar mechanism) to call the function indicated by the `functionSelector`. This function would then generate and return the dynamic metadata.
        *   **Creativity and Trendiness:** This opens up possibilities for:
            *   **Generative Art Integration:** The dynamic metadata function could generate art on-the-fly based on the NFT's state, time, or external data sources (using oracles - which would add significant complexity).
            *   **Interactive Art:** The metadata could change based on user interactions with the gallery or NFT.
            *   **Evolving Art:**  The art's representation could evolve over time, reflecting changing conditions or events.
    *   **Security Note:** Using `delegatecall` (as hinted at in the `generateDynamicMetadata` comments) is powerful but requires extreme caution. You must ensure that the functions you are calling dynamically are safe and don't introduce vulnerabilities. In a production system, you might restrict the types of functions that can be used for dynamic metadata generation. For this example, the `generateDynamicMetadata` is simplified and does not actually use `delegatecall` for security and clarity.

2.  **Community Theme Proposals & Voting (`proposeExhibitionTheme`, `voteForThemeProposal`, `getThemeProposalVotes`, `listThemeProposals`, `implementThemeProposal`):**
    *   **Concept:** Incorporates a simplified DAO-like element by allowing the community to propose and vote on exhibition themes.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Users can propose themes.
        *   Other users can vote for these proposals.
        *   The curator (or a more sophisticated governance mechanism) can then implement popular proposals, potentially creating exhibitions based on community-voted themes.
    *   **Trendiness:**  DAO and community governance are very trendy in the blockchain space. This feature provides a basic but functional example of how a gallery could be more community-driven.

3.  **Exhibition Management (`createExhibition`, `addArtToExhibition`, `removeArtFromExhibition`, `getExhibitionDetails`, `listActiveExhibitions`):**
    *   **Concept:**  Organizes art within the gallery into themed exhibitions, similar to a real-world art gallery.
    *   **Functionality:** Allows the curator to curate collections of registered NFTs into exhibitions, making the gallery more structured and engaging.

4.  **Registration of External NFTs (`setArtNFTContract`, `getArtNFTContract`, `registerArtNFT`, `unregisterArtNFT`, `isArtNFTRegistered`, `getRegisteredArtNFTs`):**
    *   **Concept:**  The gallery doesn't mint its own NFTs but integrates with existing NFT contracts (ERC721 or ERC1155).
    *   **Flexibility:** This allows the gallery to showcase art from various NFT projects and ecosystems.

**Important Notes:**

*   **External NFT Contract Interaction:** The code includes comments highlighting where you would need to interact with the external `artNFTContract` to verify ownership and NFT details in a real implementation. You would use interfaces (e.g., ERC721 or ERC1155 interfaces) for secure and type-safe interaction.
*   **Dynamic Metadata Security:**  The dynamic metadata functionality is a powerful concept, but security is paramount when implementing it, especially if you are using `delegatecall` or similar mechanisms. Thorough security audits are essential. The provided `generateDynamicMetadata` function is simplified for demonstration and security.
*   **Voting Mechanism:** The voting is very basic. For a more robust system, you would need to implement mechanisms to prevent multiple votes from the same address, potentially use weighted voting, and define clear voting periods and thresholds.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For production contracts, you would need to carefully consider gas optimization, especially for functions like `getRegisteredArtNFTs` and `listActiveExhibitions` that iterate through mappings. Pagination or more efficient data structures might be needed for large galleries.
*   **Error Handling and Events:** The contract includes `require` statements for error handling and emits events for important actions, which are good practices for smart contract development.

This smart contract provides a foundation for a decentralized dynamic art gallery with several advanced and creative features. You can expand upon these concepts to create even more innovative and engaging blockchain-based art experiences.
