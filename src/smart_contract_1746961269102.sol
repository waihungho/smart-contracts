Okay, here is a conceptual and advanced Solidity smart contract called "QuantumFlow". It implements a system for managing ERC20 token balances across different internal "Dimensional Pools" based on dynamic, configurable rules and external conditions.

The core idea is that deposited assets don't just sit in a single balance; they reside in different logical pools (`Initial`, `Superposed`, `Decohered`, `DecoheringWithdrawable`). Assets move between these pools based on a rules engine that checks conditions (e.g., time-based, external flags). This simulates complex state transitions or conditional access to funds, distinct from simple staking or locking.

This contract is designed for complexity and illustrative purposes. It would require significant further development, auditing, and potential integration with oracles or keepers for real-world use.

**QuantumFlow Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFlow`

**Core Concept:** Manages ERC20 token deposits within internal "Dimensional Pools". Assets transition between pools based on a dynamic rule engine evaluating external or time-based conditions. Provides granular control over pool states and conditional withdrawals.

**Dimensional Pools (Conceptual States):**
*   `POOL_INITIAL`: Default pool for new deposits.
*   `POOL_SUPERPOSED`: Assets in this state are subject to complex flow rules, potentially simulating staking or conditional states.
*   `POOL_DECOHERED`: A settling pool. Assets must reach here before withdrawal requests.
*   `POOL_DECOHERING_WITHDRAWABLE`: Assets within the `POOL_DECOHERED` pool that have been marked for withdrawal and are ready to be finalized by an admin.

**Key Modules:**
1.  **Access Control:** Owner and Admin roles for critical configuration and operations.
2.  **Pausability:** Standard mechanism to halt sensitive operations.
3.  **ERC20 Handling:** Deposit and Withdrawal logic via internal balance tracking across pools.
4.  **Pool Management:** Configuration of pool properties (deposit/withdrawal restrictions, target states).
5.  **Rule Engine:** Definition and management of flow rules (source pool, target pool, conditions).
6.  **Conditional Flow:** Triggering mechanisms to move assets between pools based on rule conditions.
7.  **Decoherence/Withdrawal Flow:** A multi-step process for moving assets to a withdrawable state.
8.  **Query Functions:** Retrieve contract state, balances, rules, and pool configurations.

**Function Summary:**

**Access Control & Pausability:**
1.  `constructor(address initialAdmin)`: Deploys contract, sets owner and initial admin.
2.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership (only owner).
3.  `addAdmin(address newAdmin)`: Grants admin role (only owner).
4.  `removeAdmin(address admin)`: Revokes admin role (only owner).
5.  `isAdmin(address account)`: Checks if an address has the admin role.
6.  `pauseContract()`: Pauses all sensitive operations (only owner or admin).
7.  `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract (only owner or admin).
8.  `getContractState()`: Returns true if paused, false otherwise.

**ERC20 Handling & Deposits/Withdrawals:**
9.  `deposit(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens, placing them in `POOL_INITIAL`.
10. `withdraw(address token, uint256 amount, uint8 poolId)`: Allows withdrawal from a *specific* pool if configured to allow withdrawals (`POOL_DECOHERING_WITHDRAWABLE` is the primary candidate for this).
11. `requestDecoherenceWithdrawal(address token, uint256 amount)`: Moves user's specified amount from `POOL_DECOHERED` to `POOL_DECOHERING_WITHDRAWABLE`.
12. `cancelDecoherenceRequest(address token, uint256 amount)`: Reverses a withdrawal request, moving assets back from `POOL_DECOHERING_WITHDRAWABLE` to `POOL_DECOHERED`.
13. `finalizeDecoherenceWithdrawal(address token, address user)`: Admin/System function to execute the final ERC20 transfer for assets in `POOL_DECOHERING_WITHDRAWABLE`.

**Pool Management:**
14. `setPoolConfiguration(uint8 poolId, bool depositsAllowed, bool withdrawalsAllowedFrom, bool isDecoherenceTarget)`: Configures properties of a dimensional pool (only owner or admin).
15. `getPoolConfiguration(uint8 poolId)`: Retrieves the configuration for a pool.
16. `listConfiguredPoolIds()`: Lists all pool IDs that have been configured.

**Rule Engine & Conditional Flow:**
17. `addFlowRule(uint8 ruleId, uint8 sourcePoolId, uint8 targetPoolId, uint256 minAmount, uint256 conditionValue, uint8 conditionType)`: Adds a new rule for asset flow between pools based on conditions (only owner or admin).
18. `updateFlowRule(uint8 ruleId, uint8 sourcePoolId, uint8 targetPoolId, uint256 minAmount, uint256 conditionValue, uint8 conditionType)`: Updates an existing rule (only owner or admin).
19. `removeFlowRule(uint8 ruleId)`: Removes a rule (only owner or admin).
20. `setRuleConditionFlag(uint8 ruleId, bool flagValue)`: Sets the boolean flag condition for a specific rule (only owner or admin).
21. `getRuleDetails(uint8 ruleId)`: Retrieves details of a specific rule.
22. `getRuleConditionFlag(uint8 ruleId)`: Gets the current state of a boolean flag condition for a rule.
23. `listActiveRuleIds()`: Lists all rule IDs currently configured.
24. `checkRuleCondition(uint8 ruleId)`: Public function to check if a rule's condition is met based on the current block state and flags.
25. `triggerFlowForRule(uint8 ruleId, address token)`: Attempts to trigger the flow defined by a specific rule for a given token, affecting *all* eligible users in the source pool whose balance meets the minimum amount and whose rule condition is met. Can be called by anyone.
26. `triggerEligibleFlows(address token)`: Iterates through all active rules for a token and attempts to trigger any whose condition is met. Can be called by anyone.

**Query Functions:**
27. `getUserBalanceInPool(address user, address token, uint8 poolId)`: Gets a user's balance for a specific token within a specific pool.
28. `getTotalBalanceInPool(address token, uint8 poolId)`: Gets the total amount of a specific token across all users within a specific pool.
29. `getUserTotalBalance(address user, address token)`: Calculates and returns the sum of a user's balance for a token across all pools.
30. `getTotalSupply(address token)`: Returns the total amount of a specific token held within the contract across all pools.
