Okay, let's design a smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Creative Fund (DACF). This contract will allow users to contribute funds, stake governance tokens to vote on creative project proposals and project milestones, and manage the distribution of funds based on decentralized decisions.

Here are some advanced/creative/trendy concepts we can integrate:

1.  **Milestone-Based Funding:** Project funds are released in stages upon successful completion and verification (via voting) of defined milestones.
2.  **Delegated Voting:** Stakers can delegate their voting power to others.
3.  **Reputation/Contribution Tracking:** Internal points for contributors and active voters/governors.
4.  **Governance Parameters:** Key parameters (voting periods, thresholds) can be adjusted via governance proposals.
5.  **Slashing Mechanism:** A mechanism to recover funds from failed projects (potentially triggered by governance).
6.  **Epochs/Rounds (Conceptual):** The system naturally supports funding rounds through proposal submission periods.
7.  **Conditional Logic:** Fund release is conditional on vote outcomes.

We will aim for over 20 functions covering these aspects.

// --- Outline and Function Summary ---
//
// Contract: DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeFund (DACF)
// Purpose: A decentralized platform for funding creative projects via community governance.
//
// I. Configuration & Setup (Owner/Governance)
//    1. constructor(): Deploys the contract, sets initial owner and required token addresses.
//    2. setGovernanceToken(): Sets the address of the ERC-20 token used for staking and voting.
//    3. setFundingToken(): Sets the address of the ERC-20 token accepted for contributions.
//    4. setGovernanceParams(): Sets core governance parameters like voting period, thresholds, and quorum.
//    5. emergencyPause(): Pauses core contract functions in emergencies (callable by owner, ideally replaced by governance).
//    6. emergencyUnpause(): Unpauses the contract.
//
// II. Funding & Contributions
//    7. contribute(): Allows users to contribute funding tokens to the fund.
//    8. getFundBalance(): Returns the total balance of funding tokens held by the contract.
//
// III. Staking & Governance Power
//    9. stakeGovernanceTokens(): Users stake governance tokens to gain voting power.
//    10. unstakeGovernanceTokens(): Users request to unstake tokens (may involve a time lock).
//    11. claimUnstakedTokens(): Users claim tokens after the unstaking time lock.
//    12. delegateVote(): Users delegate their voting power to another address.
//    13. revokeDelegation(): Users revoke their vote delegation.
//    14. getVoterWeight(): Returns the current voting power of an address (including delegation).
//    15. getUserStake(): Returns the amount of tokens staked by an address.
//
// IV. Project Proposals & Voting
//    16. submitProjectProposal(): Creators submit a new project proposal with details and milestones.
//    17. getProjectProposal(): Views the details of a specific project proposal.
//    18. voteOnProposal(): Stakers/delegates vote on a project proposal.
//    19. tallyProposalVotes(): Calculates the outcome of a proposal vote after the voting period ends.
//    20. executeApprovedProposal(): Initiates an approved project and releases the first milestone funds.
//    21. getProposalStatus(): Checks the current status of a proposal.
//    22. getProposalVoteOutcome(): Gets the final outcome of a tallied proposal.
//
// V. Project & Milestone Management
//    23. submitMilestoneCompletion(): Project team reports completion of a milestone.
//    24. getMilestoneDetails(): Views details of a specific project milestone.
//    25. voteOnMilestone(): Stakers/delegates vote on the completion of a project milestone.
//    26. tallyMilestoneVotes(): Calculates the outcome of a milestone vote.
//    27. releaseMilestoneFunds(): Releases funds for an approved milestone.
//    28. getProjectStatus(): Checks the overall status of a project.
//    29. slashProjectFunds(): Recovers funds from a failed or malicious project (requires governance approval via separate proposal or logic).
//    30. getUserProjectRole(): Checks if a user is part of a project team.
//
// VI. Governance Proposals (Future Expansion, basic params included)
//    (Conceptual functions for governance proposals to change params, potentially add roles, etc. - not fully implemented here but structure allows it)
//    31. submitGovernanceProposal(): Submits a proposal to change contract parameters.
//    32. voteOnGovernanceProposal(): Votes on a governance proposal.
//    33. tallyGovernanceProposalVotes(): Tally governance proposal votes.
//    34. executeGovernanceProposal(): Executes an approved governance proposal.
//
// VII. Utility & Information
//    35. getUserReputation(): Returns the reputation points of a user.
//
// Total Functions: 35 (Well over the required 20)

    // }
    // This requires moving the Milestone struct definition *after* the state variables that use it (like `Proposal` and `Project`),
    // or forward declaring it (not possible for structs with mappings).
    // The simplest fix is to put struct definitions *before* state variables that use them.

    // Let's restructure slightly to ensure structs with mappings are defined early.

**Explanation of Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **Configuration (`constructor`, `setGovernanceToken`, `setFundingToken`, `setGovernanceParams`, `emergencyPause`, `emergencyUnpause`):** Standard setup functions, controlled by the owner initially. `setGovernanceParams` introduces parameters that would ideally be moved under decentralized governance control later. Pausability is a safety feature.
2.  **Funding (`contribute`, `getFundBalance`):** Basic functions for users to send tokens to the contract's fund pool. `contribute` also awards a small amount of reputation points.
3.  **Staking & Governance Power (`stakeGovernanceTokens`, `unstakeGovernanceTokens`, `claimUnstakedTokens`, `delegateVote`, `revokeDelegation`, `getVoterWeight`, `getUserStake`, `totalStakedBalance`):** This is where governance participation is managed. Users stake tokens to get voting power. Unstaking involves a time lock (`unstakeLockDuration`). Delegation allows users to assign their voting power to someone else, simplifying participation for passive stakers. `getVoterWeight` calculates the effective voting power (simplified here to direct stake). `totalStakedBalance` is conceptually needed for quorum checks but would require careful implementation or a state variable for efficiency.
4.  **Project Proposals & Voting (`submitProjectProposal`, `getProjectProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, `tallyProposalVotes`, `executeApprovedProposal`, `getProposalStatus`, `getProposalVoteOutcome`):** The core of the DACF. Users submit proposals outlining projects and milestones. Stakers/delegates vote. Proposals are tallied after the voting period, checking against configurable quorum and approval thresholds. Approved proposals are executed, creating a `Project` entry and releasing the initial milestone's funds.
5.  **Project & Milestone Management (`submitMilestoneCompletion`, `getMilestoneDetails`, `voteOnMilestone`, `tallyMilestoneVotes`, `releaseMilestoneFunds`, `getProjectStatus`, `slashProjectFunds`, `getUserProjectRole`):** Manages active projects. Project teams report milestone completion. Stakers/delegates vote on milestones. Approved milestones trigger the release of the next funding tranche. `slashProjectFunds` allows for recovering funds from failed projects, conceptually requiring governance approval (though simplified in this code example to just checking the project status).
6.  **Governance Proposals (`submitGovernanceProposal`, `voteOnGovernanceProposal`, `tallyGovernanceProposalVotes`, `executeGovernanceProposal`):** These are placeholders illustrating how the system could evolve to allow the community to propose changes to the contract's parameters or other actions. A full implementation would involve more complex data structures and execution logic, likely inheriting from a standard DAO framework.
7.  **Utility (`getUserReputation`):** Simple function to view the internal reputation points earned by users through contributions and voting.

This contract incorporates several advanced concepts like milestone-based funding, delegated voting (basic structure), reputation tracking, and configurable governance parameters within a system designed for decentralized creative funding, providing a solid foundation with significantly more than 20 functions. Note that the full implementation of governance proposals and potentially the `totalStakedBalance` tracking would add complexity but the current structure includes the function signatures as requested. The `Milestone` struct was updated to include a `hasVotedMilestone` mapping to correctly track votes per milestone.
