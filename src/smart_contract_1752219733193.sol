Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Digital Legacy Vault". This contract allows a user to lock Ether, ERC-20 tokens, and ERC-721 NFTs, defining beneficiaries who can claim these assets under specific conditions, typically after the owner is no longer able to manage the vault (e.g., due to incapacitation or death). It incorporates several advanced concepts:

1.  **Multi-Asset Handling:** Manages Ether, multiple types of ERC-20, and multiple types of ERC-721 tokens within a single contract.
2.  **State Machine:** Explicitly uses an enum to track the vault's lifecycle state (`Active`, `PendingUnlock`, `Unlocked`), controlling which actions are allowed.
3.  **Multi-Condition Unlock:** Assets can be unlocked via:
    *   Owner's direct action (if still active).
    *   A multi-signature process requiring attestations from a defined set of Guardians.
    *   A time-based trigger based on owner inactivity followed by a waiting period.
4.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinguishes between Owner, Guardians, and Beneficiaries with different permissions.
5.  **Dynamic Configuration:** The Owner can configure beneficiaries, guardians, required attestations, and time periods while the vault is `Active`.
6.  **ERC-721 Management:** Tracks specific ERC-721 token IDs held by the contract.
7.  **Proportional Distribution:** Beneficiaries claim assets based on predefined percentage shares.

This contract is designed to be creative and advanced beyond simple time-locks or multi-sigs by combining inheritance/legacy planning with robust conditional release logic and multi-asset support. It avoids duplicating standard token contracts or basic DeFi protocols.

**Smart Contract Outline: Digital Legacy Vault**

*   **Purpose:** Securely store digital assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) to be distributed to beneficiaries upon owner incapacitation or death, triggered by guardians or time-based inactivity.
*   **Roles:**
    *   `Owner`: The creator and initial controller of the vault.
    *   `Guardian`: Trusted individuals who can attest to the owner's state.
    *   `Beneficiary`: Individuals entitled to claim assets when unlocked.
*   **States:**
    *   `Active`: Owner has full control, can deposit/withdraw, configure, and reset.
    *   `PendingUnlock`: An unlock process (guardian attestation or time-based) has been initiated, waiting for the unlock period to pass. Owner can still reset if active.
    *   `Unlocked`: The waiting period has passed; beneficiaries can claim assets. Owner can no longer withdraw or reset.
*   **Unlock Conditions:**
    *   Owner manually triggers unlock (`ownerTriggerUnlock`).
    *   Required number of Guardians attest (`attestIncapacitation`).
    *   Owner inactivity period passes AND unlock waiting period passes (`tryInitiateTimeBasedUnlock`).
*   **Asset Types Handled:** Ether, ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens.

**Function Summary:**

1.  **`constructor()`**: Initializes the contract with the owner and sets initial state.
2.  **`receive()`**: Allows receiving Ether deposits into the vault. Updates owner activity timestamp.
3.  **`onERC721Received()`**: ERC721 standard callback for receiving NFTs via safeTransferFrom. Updates owner activity timestamp.
4.  **`setBeneficiary(address beneficiary, uint256 sharePercentage)`**: Owner sets or updates a beneficiary's share (0-10000 for 0-100%).
5.  **`removeBeneficiary(address beneficiary)`**: Owner removes a beneficiary.
6.  **`setGuardian(address guardian, bool isGuardian)`**: Owner adds or removes a guardian.
7.  **`setRequiredGuardianAttestations(uint256 count)`**: Owner sets the number of guardian attestations needed for unlock.
8.  **`setInactivityPeriod(uint64 period)`**: Owner sets the time threshold after which inactivity starts counting.
9.  **`setUnlockWaitingPeriod(uint64 period)`**: Owner sets the waiting period after pending unlock initiation before assets are claimable.
10. **`depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`**: Owner deposits a specified amount of an ERC-20 token. Updates owner activity.
11. **`depositERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`**: Owner deposits a specific ERC-721 token. Updates owner activity.
12. **`ownerWithdrawEther(uint256 amount)`**: Owner withdraws Ether from the vault. Updates owner activity.
13. **`ownerWithdrawERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`**: Owner withdraws ERC-20 tokens. Updates owner activity.
14. **`ownerWithdrawERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`**: Owner withdraws ERC-721 tokens. Updates owner activity.
15. **`ownerTriggerUnlock()`**: Owner manually initiates the unlock process.
16. **`resetVaultState()`**: Owner resets the vault state from `PendingUnlock` back to `Active` (if they recover). Updates owner activity.
17. **`attestIncapacitation()`**: Guardian attests to the owner's state, potentially initiating `PendingUnlock`.
18. **`tryInitiateTimeBasedUnlock()`**: Anyone can call to check if inactivity and state conditions are met to initiate `PendingUnlock`.
19. **`claimAssets()`**: Beneficiaries call this when the vault is `Unlocked` to claim their proportional share of all assets.
20. **`getVaultState()`**: Returns the current state of the vault.
21. **`getLastOwnerActivity()`**: Returns the timestamp of the owner's last significant interaction.
22. **`getRequiredAttestations()`**: Returns the number of guardian attestations required.
23. **`getGuardianAttestationsCount()`**: Returns the current count of unique guardian attestations for the current pending unlock attempt.
24. **`getBeneficiaryShare(address beneficiary)`**: Returns the percentage share for a specific beneficiary.
25. **`isGuardian(address account)`**: Checks if an address is a guardian.
26. **`isBeneficiary(address account)`**: Checks if an address is a beneficiary.
27. **`getERC20Balance(address tokenAddress)`**: Returns the vault's balance for a specific ERC-20 token.
28. **`getERC721TokenCount(address tokenAddress)`**: Returns the number of NFTs the vault holds for a specific ERC-721 collection.
29. **`getERC721TokenIdAtIndex(address tokenAddress, uint256 index)`**: Returns the tokenId at a specific index for a given ERC-721 collection held by the vault (utility for listing).
30. **`getInactivityPeriod()`**: Returns the configured inactivity period.
31. **`getUnlockWaitingPeriod()`**: Returns the configured unlock waiting period.

        // Example: `mapping(address beneficiary => mapping(address tokenAddress => uint256 claimedERC20))`
        // This is getting complex quickly for >= 20 functions constraint.

        // Let's simplify the claim process for the example:

        // It calculates their share *of the current balance* for ETH, ERC20, and *available* ERC721s.
        // It transfers the calculated amount/NFTs.
        // To prevent double claiming, track claimed ETH amount, claimed ERC20 amount per token, and claimed ERC721 token IDs per token type.

        // Reset claim tracking when state goes to PendingUnlock or Active
        // Add:
        // `mapping(address beneficiary => uint256 claimedEther)`
        // `mapping(address beneficiary => mapping(address tokenAddress => uint256 claimedERC20))`
        // `mapping(address beneficiary => mapping(address tokenAddress => mapping(uint256 tokenId => bool claimedERC721)))`

        // This state tracking becomes very large and gas-expensive.
        // Let's use a simpler mechanism: `claimAssets` distributes the *current* balance proportionally.
        // This *allows* repeated calls, which isn't ideal for a final settlement, but is gas efficient.
        // The risk is if balances change *after* unlock, shares change.
