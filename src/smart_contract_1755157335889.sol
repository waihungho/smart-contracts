Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's design a smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on funding and accelerating cutting-edge, verifiable innovation and research. I'll call it **"QuantumLeap DAO"**.

The core idea is to go beyond simple token-weighted voting and incorporate elements of:
1.  **Verifiable Progress:** Funding tied to demonstrable milestones, potentially verified via Zero-Knowledge Proofs or trusted oracles.
2.  **Dynamic Reputation (ImpactScore):** A non-transferable internal score reflecting a participant's positive contributions, successful project deliveries, and peer reviews, influencing their voting power and privileges.
3.  **On-chain IP Management:** Representing project intellectual property as non-fungible tokens (IP-NFTs) that can be collectively owned or licensed by the DAO.
4.  **Adaptive Governance:** Governance parameters can evolve based on proposals and the collective ImpactScore.
5.  **Conceptual AI Integration:** A mechanism for the DAO to collectively fund and interpret external AI analyses for decision-making (e.g., proposal vetting, trend prediction).

## QuantumLeap DAO Smart Contract

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This contract defines the QuantumLeap DAO, a decentralized entity designed to fund, manage, and govern innovative projects with verifiable milestones and dynamic participant reputation.

**I. Core DAO Governance & Treasury Management**
*   `constructor`: Initializes the DAO with core parameters, owner, and initial treasury.
*   `submitProposal`: Allows members to propose changes, projects, or actions.
*   `voteOnProposal`: Enables members to vote on proposals, with voting power influenced by `ImpactScore` and staked tokens.
*   `executeProposal`: Executes a successful proposal.
*   `updateGovernanceParameter`: Modifies core DAO parameters via proposal.
*   `withdrawTreasuryFunds`: Disburses funds from the DAO treasury via proposal.
*   `updateImpactScoreWeightings`: Allows the DAO to adjust the weightings for `ImpactScore` calculation through a proposal.

**II. Project Lifecycle & Funding**
*   `registerInnovationProject`: Allows a project lead to submit a new project proposal with defined milestones and funding requests.
*   `approveProjectFunding`: DAO approves a project for funding and allocates initial funds.
*   `submitProjectMilestone`: Project lead reports completion of a milestone.
*   `verifyProjectMilestone`: Oracles or a Zero-Knowledge Verifier system confirms milestone completion.
*   `releaseMilestonePayment`: Automatically releases funds upon successful milestone verification.
*   `raiseMilestoneDispute`: Allows any DAO member to challenge a milestone verification.
*   `resolveMilestoneDispute`: The DAO votes to resolve a dispute, potentially re-evaluating verification or clawing back funds.
*   `liquidateUnusedProjectFunds`: Recovers unspent funds from projects that are cancelled or completed under budget.

**III. Reputation & Contribution System (ImpactScore)**
*   `calculateImpactScore`: Internal function that computes a participant's reputation based on contributions, successful projects, and peer reviews. This score influences voting power and privileges.
*   `submitPeerReview`: Allows DAO members to submit reviews for other members' contributions or project work, influencing their `ImpactScore`.
*   `updateContributorProfile`: Allows a contributor to update their public profile information stored on-chain.

**IV. Intellectual Property (IP-NFT) Management**
*   `mintProjectIPNFT`: Mints a non-fungible token (IP-NFT) representing the intellectual property of a successfully completed project. This IP-NFT can be owned by the DAO or fractionalized.
*   `requestIPNFTSaleApproval`: Allows the DAO to propose the sale or licensing of a project's IP-NFT.
*   `distributeIPNFTProceeds`: Distributes proceeds from IP-NFT sales/licensing to relevant stakeholders (DAO treasury, project team, etc.) as per a proposal.

**V. Advanced / Hybrid Concepts**
*   `fundAIAnalysisRequest`: Allows the DAO to allocate funds for calling an external AI service for specific analysis (e.g., proposal sentiment, trend analysis for new projects). This represents a budget and trigger for off-chain AI.
*   `verifyZKProofForMilestone`: A conceptual function to integrate with a Zero-Knowledge Proof verifier contract for high-assurance milestone verification.
*   `setOracleAddress`: DAO governance function to update the address of the trusted oracle network.
*   `setZKVerifierAddress`: DAO governance function to update the address of the Zero-Knowledge Verifier contract.

**VI. Utility & Emergency Functions**
*   `pauseContract`: Allows an emergency multisig or DAO vote to pause critical contract functions.
*   `unpauseContract`: Unpauses the contract functions.
*   `drainEmergencyFunds`: Allows a specific emergency role (e.g., multisig) to withdraw a limited amount of funds in dire situations.
