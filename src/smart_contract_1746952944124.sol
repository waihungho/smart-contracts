Okay, here is a smart contract concept I've designed called `QuantumFluxVault`. It incorporates several advanced concepts like state-dependent logic, dynamic fees/delays, scheduled events, role-based access control, queued operations, and a simulated external condition trigger, all wrapped around a core idea of a vault whose behavior changes based on its "flux state".

It aims to be unique by combining these elements in a non-standard way, moving beyond typical ERC20/721 extensions or simple staking/voting.

/**
 * @title QuantumFluxVault
 * @dev A multi-state vault contract managing Ether and approved ERC20 tokens.
 * The vault's behavior (withdrawal fees, delays, limits, etc.) is governed
 * by its current "Flux State", which can change based on time, manual triggers,
 * scheduled events, or simulated external conditions.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Management: Defines different Flux States and parameters for each.
 * 2. Asset Management: Handles deposits and withdrawals of Ether and approved ERC20s.
 * 3. Dynamic Withdrawals: Withdrawal logic is state-dependent (fees, delays, eligibility).
 * 4. Queued Withdrawals: Implements a system for withdrawals requiring a time delay.
 * 5. Flux State Transitions: Mechanisms for changing states (manual, scheduled, conditional).
 * 6. Role-Based Access Control: Custom roles for managing different contract functions.
 * 7. Ownership Transfer: Secure, time-delayed ownership transfer.
 * 8. Emergency Procedures: A distinct path for emergency withdrawals under special conditions.
 * 9. Configuration: Functions for setting state parameters, allowed tokens, roles, etc.
 * 10. Simulation: A simulated external condition toggle demonstrates conditional logic without a full oracle integration.
 *
 * Function Summary (>= 20 functions):
 * - State Inquiry (5): getCurrentFluxState, getFluxStateParameters, getLastFluxTransitionTime, checkWithdrawalEligibility, checkExternalConditionStatus
 * - Vault Interaction (4): depositEther, depositERC20, withdrawEther, withdrawERC20
 * - Withdrawal Management (4): queueWithdrawal, processQueuedWithdrawal, cancelQueuedWithdrawal, getQueuedWithdrawalDetails
 * - State Transition (4): triggerFluxEvent, setTimeBasedTransitionParameters, removeTimeBasedTransition, triggerScheduledTransition
 * - Access Control & Ownership (6): setRole, renounceRole, hasRole, transferOwnershipWithDelay, cancelOwnershipTransfer, acceptOwnership
 * - Configuration (7): setFluxStateParameters, addAllowedERC20, removeAllowedERC20, setMinimumWithdrawalAmount, setMaximumWithdrawalAmount, setTransitionTriggerReward, setExternalConditionStatus
 * - Emergency (2): toggleEmergencyStatus, emergencyWithdraw
 * - Viewers & Utilities (>=2): getAllowedERC20s, getERC20Balance, getVaultTotalValue, getWithdrawalDelay, calculateDynamicWithdrawalFee, getMinWithdrawalAmount, getMaxWithdrawalAmount, getPendingOwner, getTransferDelayTime, getEmergencyStatus, getTransitionTriggerReward, getTotalQueuedWithdrawals, checkScheduledTransitionById
 *
 * Total Public/External Functions: 34

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **State-Dependent Logic (`FluxState` Enum and `FluxStateParams` Mapping):** The core concept is that the contract's operational parameters (fees, delays, limits, allowed actions) are not static but dynamically determined by the `currentFluxState`. This creates complex branching logic based on an internal state machine.
2.  **Dynamic Fees and Delays:** Withdrawal fees (`withdrawalFeeBps`) and time delays (`withdrawalDelaySeconds`) are not fixed but pulled from the `fluxStateParameters` mapping based on the current state. This allows the contract to adapt its friction based on perceived conditions (simulated by the state).
3.  **Queued Withdrawals (`QueuedWithdrawal` Struct, Mappings, and Functions):** Instead of instant withdrawals, certain states (`queueWithdrawalRequired = true`) force users to queue their requests. They must then call `processQueuedWithdrawal` after a delay. This adds a multi-step user interaction pattern and time-based constraint.
4.  **Scheduled State Transitions (`ScheduledTransition` Struct, Mapping, and `triggerScheduledTransition`):** Allows the contract to be configured for future, automatic state changes. The `triggerScheduledTransition` function is designed to be callable by anyone, incentivizing off-chain services (like Chainlink Keepers) to execute the state change precisely when scheduled. This is a common pattern for time-sensitive actions in Solidity.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control (Custom `Role` Enum and Mapping):** Moving beyond a single `onlyOwner`, different privileged actions are assigned to specific roles (`StateChanger`, `ParameterAdjuster`, `EmergencyOperator`). This provides more granular permissions. (A simple manual implementation is used here instead of importing libraries like OpenZeppelin to keep it self-contained and contribute to function count).
6.  **Delayed Ownership Transfer:** A standard security feature for critical contracts, preventing instant rug-pulls by requiring a time delay before a new owner can take control via the `acceptOwnership` function.
7.  **Simulated External Condition:** The `simulatedExternalConditionStatus` boolean, toggled by `setExternalConditionStatus`, serves as a placeholder for how a contract might use external data (from an oracle) to influence its behavior, specifically shown controlling withdrawals in the `Entangled` state.
8.  **Emergency Override:** The `isEmergencyActive` flag, toggled by `toggleEmergencyStatus`, provides a separate operational mode (`emergencyWithdraw`) that might bypass some normal state restrictions in critical situations.

This contract architecture provides a framework for a highly configurable and dynamic vault, where the rules of interaction constantly evolve based on internal state, scheduled events, and potentially external factors.
