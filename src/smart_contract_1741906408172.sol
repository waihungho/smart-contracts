 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract Outline and Summary
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A creative and advanced smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 *      This contract facilitates the creation, curation, fractionalization, and collaborative evolution of digital art within a decentralized community.
 *      It incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic NFT traits, generative art integration (simplified example), community-driven curation with voting,
 *      fractional ownership, and evolving art pieces influenced by collective decisions.
 *
 * **Contract Summary:**
 *
 *  **Core Functionality:**
 *      - **Artwork Submission & Curation:** Artists can submit artwork proposals, and community members can vote to curate them into the collective.
 *      - **Dynamic NFT Generation:**  Upon curation, unique NFTs are generated with dynamic traits influenced by initial artist input and community votes.
 *      - **Generative Art Integration (Simplified):**  Includes a basic example of on-chain generative art trait derivation based on artwork metadata and random seeds.
 *      - **Fractional Ownership:** Allows fractionalization of curated artworks, enabling shared ownership and democratic governance.
 *      - **Community Governance:**  Implements a voting system for various aspects, including artwork curation, trait evolution, and collective treasury management.
 *      - **Evolving Artworks:**  Features mechanisms for community-driven evolution of artwork traits and properties over time through proposals and voting.
 *      - **Royalties & Revenue Sharing:**  Distributes royalties from secondary sales to artists, fractional owners, and the collective treasury.
 *      - **Staking & Membership:**  Allows users to stake tokens to become members and participate in curation and governance.
 *      - **Treasury Management:**  A collective treasury managed by community votes for funding DAAC initiatives.
 *      - **Art Marketplace Integration (Conceptual):**  Provides functions for listing and selling fractionalized art on integrated marketplaces.
 *
 *  **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 *      - **Dynamic NFTs:** NFTs with traits that can change based on on-chain logic and community interaction.
 *      - **On-Chain Generative Art (Simplified):**  Basic demonstration of trait generation within the contract.
 *      - **Fractionalization & Governance:**  Combines fractional NFTs with DAO governance principles.
 *      - **Evolving Smart Contracts:**  Artworks are not static; they can evolve based on collective will.
 *      - **Community-Driven Curation:**  Decentralized curation process for art selection.
 *      - **Staking-Based Membership:**  Incentivizes active participation and community building.
 *
 *  **Functions (20+):**
 *      1. `submitArtworkProposal()`: Artists submit artwork proposals with metadata.
 *      2. `startCurationRound()`: Admin initiates a new curation round for artwork proposals.
 *      3. `voteOnArtworkProposal()`: Members vote on submitted artwork proposals.
 *      4. `finalizeCurationRound()`: Admin finalizes a curation round and accepts/rejects artworks based on votes.
 *      5. `mintCuratedArtworkNFT()`: Mints an NFT for a curated artwork, generating dynamic traits.
 *      6. `getArtworkTraits()`: Retrieves the dynamic traits of a specific artwork NFT.
 *      7. `fractionalizeArtwork()`: Allows the collective to fractionalize a curated artwork NFT into ERC20 tokens.
 *      8. `redeemFractionalShares()`: Allows fractional token holders to redeem their shares for a portion of the artwork (or its value).
 *      9. `createEvolutionProposal()`: Members can propose changes to artwork traits or properties.
 *      10. `voteOnEvolutionProposal()`: Members vote on artwork evolution proposals.
 *      11. `executeEvolutionProposal()`: Admin executes approved artwork evolution proposals, updating NFT traits.
 *      12. `stakeForMembership()`: Users stake governance tokens to become DAAC members.
 *      13. `unstakeFromMembership()`: Members can unstake their tokens and leave membership.
 *      14. `createTreasuryProposal()`: Members can propose spending or managing funds from the collective treasury.
 *      15. `voteOnTreasuryProposal()`: Members vote on treasury management proposals.
 *      16. `executeTreasuryProposal()`: Admin executes approved treasury proposals.
 *      17. `setArtworkPrice()`: Artist (or fractional owners) can set the price for an artwork NFT.
 *      18. `buyArtworkNFT()`: Anyone can purchase a curated artwork NFT.
 *      19. `withdrawArtistRoyalties()`: Artists can withdraw royalties earned from secondary sales.
 *      20. `withdrawFractionalOwnerShare()`: Fractional token holders can withdraw their share of revenue.
 *      21. `getArtworkDetails()`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 *      22. `getMemberDetails()`: Retrieves details about a DAAC member.
 *      23. `setPlatformFee()`: Admin sets a platform fee for artwork sales (for treasury).
 *
 *  **Note:** This is a conceptual contract and may require further development, security audits, and gas optimization for production use.
