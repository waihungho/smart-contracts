Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines concepts of dynamic governance, tokenomics, NFTs, and simulated external interaction, framed as an "Evolutionary DAO".

The core idea is a DAO that manages a pool of assets (Treasury) and has adjustable "Traits" (parameters). It progresses through "Epochs," potentially unlocking new capabilities or altering rules. Governance is based on staked tokens and special "Guardian" NFTs. An external "Oracle" (simulated here) can trigger "Adaptation Events" that influence the DAO's traits.

This avoids duplicating standard templates like Governor Alpha/Bravo directly, OpenZeppelin AccessControl (using a simple owner/DAO controlled pattern), or standard ERC20/ERC721 implementations (we'll interact via interfaces but assume the actual tokens are custom or configured differently).

## EvolutionaryDAO Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Description:** A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that manages a treasury, allows governance through staked tokens and Guardian NFTs, and evolves its parameters ("Traits") based on successful proposals and simulated external "Adaptation Events."
2.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Traits:** Dynamic parameters (e.g., voting period, quorum, reward rates) that define the DAO's behavior. Stored as `mapping(string => uint256)`.
    *   **Epochs:** Sequential periods the DAO progresses through, potentially unlocking new rules or capabilities.
    *   **Governance:** Proposal lifecycle (create, vote, queue, execute, cancel) based on staked governance tokens and Guardian NFTs.
    *   **Treasury:** A pool of native currency (Ether) and potentially other tokens managed by the DAO.
    *   **Staking:** Users stake governance tokens to gain voting power and earn rewards.
    *   **Guardian NFTs:** Special NFTs granting boosted voting power and potentially veto rights (veto not fully implemented for brevity/complexity).
    *   **Adaptation Events:** External triggers (simulated via an Oracle role) that can influence the DAO's Traits.
    *   **Catalyst Pool:** A sub-pool within the treasury dedicated to funding "evolutionary" projects.
3.  **Function Summary:**
    *   **Initialization:** `constructor`
    *   **Parameter/Trait Management:** `updateTraitParameter` (callable by DAO execution)
    *   **Staking:** `stakeTokens`, `unstakeTokens`, `claimStakingRewards`
    *   **Delegation:** `delegateVotingPower`, `undelegateVotingPower` (Simplified: delegates stake/power directly)
    *   **Guardian NFTs:** `grantGuardianNFT`, `revokeGuardianNFT`, `isGuardian` (Query)
    *   **Governance (Proposals):** `createProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, `queueProposal`, `executeProposal`, `cancelProposal`
    *   **Treasury Management:** `depositToTreasury`, `withdrawFromTreasury` (callable by DAO execution), `fundCatalystPool` (callable by DAO execution), `grantFromCatalystPool` (callable by DAO execution)
    *   **Evolutionary Mechanics:** `progressEpoch` (callable by DAO execution), `triggerAdaptationEvent` (callable by Oracle role), `setOracleAddress`
    *   **Queries:** `getCurrentEpoch`, `getTraitParameter`, `getVotingPower`, `getProposalState`, `getUserStakingInfo`, `getUserDelegationInfo`, `getProposalDetails`, `getTreasuryBalance`, `getCatalystPoolBalance`

**Explanation of Advanced/Interesting/Creative Aspects:**

1.  **Evolutionary Traits (`traits` mapping, `updateTraitParameter`):** Instead of static parameters, the DAO governs its own fundamental rules (voting periods, quorum, reward rates). This allows the DAO to "adapt" its internal governance mechanisms over time through successful proposals, acting like on-chain "genes" that can be mutated.
2.  **Epochs (`currentEpoch`, `epochStartBlock`, `progressEpoch`):** Introduces a concept of discrete developmental stages for the DAO. Epochs can be used to gate capabilities, change rules more dramatically, or signify major milestones reached through collective action (e.g., completing a certain number of successful proposals).
3.  **Guardian NFTs (`guardianNFT`, `grantGuardianNFT`, `revokeGuardianNFT`, `isGuardian`):** Introduces a second dimension to governance beyond pure token stake. NFTs can represent different classes of membership, roles, or historical contributions, granting boosted voting power or other privileges. This moves beyond simple one-token-one-vote or basic stake-weighted systems. (The NFT logic is simplified for the example, relying on an external contract's state).
4.  **Adaptation Events (`oracleAddress`, `triggerAdaptationEvent`):** Allows simulated interaction with external data or events. An "Oracle" role can trigger a function that modifies DAO traits based on outside information, simulating how a real-world factor (market condition, weather, external API feed) could influence the DAO's on-chain behavior. This links the DAO's evolution to its environment.
5.  **Catalyst Pool (`catalystPoolBalance`, `fundCatalystPool`, `grantFromCatalystPool`):** A dedicated sub-treasury specifically earmarked for funding R&D, experiments, or "evolutionary" projects that might not fit standard treasury disbursements. This encourages investment in the DAO's future development.
6.  **Dynamic Quorum (`requiredQuorum` in `Proposal`):** While basic quorum is standard, capturing the `requiredQuorum` *at the time of proposal creation* from the current traits allows different proposals or epochs to potentially require different levels of consensus.
7.  **Simplified Delegation with Power Tracking (`delegates`, `delegatedVotingPower`, `delegateVotingPower`, `undelegateVotingPower`):** While a full ERC20Votes implementation is avoided per the prompt, a basic delegation mechanism is included where staked power can be assigned to a delegatee, and the contract tracks the *delegated voting power* sums. This is a common advanced feature in DAOs. (Note: The snapshotting for proposal voting power is simplified and needs robust implementation for production).
8.  **Internal Reward Calculation (`unclaimedStakingRewards`, `_calculatePendingStakingRewards`, `_distributeStakingRewards`):** Staking rewards accrue internally based on time/blocks, requiring a claim action. This is a standard DeFi pattern integrated into the governance tokenomics.
9.  **Structured Governance Lifecycle (`Proposal` struct, `State` enum, distinct proposal functions):** Implements a typical multi-stage proposal process (Pending -> Active -> Queued -> Executed/Defeated/Canceled), which is crucial for robust governance, adding complexity beyond simple voting.
10. **`onlyOwnerOrDAO` Modifier:** Shows the pattern of transitioning control from an initial administrative owner to the DAO itself (represented by `msg.sender == address(this)` when a proposal executes a function on itself).

This contract attempts to combine several advanced concepts within the DAO framework, making it more dynamic and potentially responsive than typical static governance structures, while aiming to not be a direct copy of a single common open-source template. Note that areas like robust snapshotting for voting power and full cross-contract interaction with the mocked NFT/Oracle would require more complex implementation for a production system.
