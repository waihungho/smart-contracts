Okay, let's design a smart contract for a **Decentralized Autonomous Creative Collective (DACC)**. This contract will manage membership, govern collective projects, track contributions, distribute revenue based on contribution, and maintain a dynamic "collective vibe" parameter.

It incorporates:
1.  **Complex Membership:** Staking, requests, voting, staged onboarding/offboarding.
2.  **Parametric Governance:** Flexible proposal types, stake/contribution weighted voting, dynamic quorum/thresholds set by governance.
3.  **On-chain Contribution Tracking:** Members submit proofs, get rated (implicitly or explicitly via governance), affecting a dynamic score.
4.  **Revenue Sharing:** Protocol revenue or external funds can be distributed based on contribution scores.
5.  **Dynamic State (Collective Vibe):** A contract parameter that changes based on the collective's activity and success, potentially influencing future parameters or interactions.
6.  **Epoch Processing:** A mechanism to periodically finalize contributions, update scores, and adjust the collective vibe.

This design avoids simple ERC-20/ERC-721 minting/trading logic and focuses on managing a complex collaborative human/protocol interaction model on-chain.

**Smart Contract: DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeCollective**

**Outline:**

1.  **SPDX-License-Identifier:** MIT
2.  **Pragma:** solidity ^0.8.0;
3.  **Imports:** None (for self-containment, assuming a standard ERC20 token for staking/governance).
4.  **Errors:** Custom errors for specific failure conditions.
5.  **Events:** Emissions for key state changes (Membership, Proposals, Voting, Treasury, Contributions, Epochs, Vibe).
6.  **Enums:** Define states for Members, Proposals.
7.  **Structs:** Define data structures for Member, Proposal, ContributionProof, Project, GovernanceParams.
8.  **State Variables:** Mappings, counters, critical addresses (staking token), governance parameters, collective vibe, epoch data.
9.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state checks (e.g., `onlyMember`, `onlyActiveMember`, `whenVotingPeriodActive`).
10. **Constructor:** Initialize the contract with essential parameters (staking token).
11. **Functions (Grouped by Category):**
    *   **Membership Management:** (7 functions) Staking, requesting, voting on, onboarding, initiating exit, finalizing exit, adjusting stake.
    *   **Governance:** (6 functions) Proposing (generic), voting, executing, cancelling, delegating vote weight, updating governance parameters.
    *   **Projects & Contributions:** (5 functions) Proposing project, submitting contribution proof, registering project outcome, linking revenue to project, claiming revenue share.
    *   **Treasury & Funding:** (3 functions) Depositing funds, initiating treasury withdrawal, distributing revenue.
    *   **Dynamic State & Epochs:** (3 functions) Triggering epoch processing, updating collective vibe (internal/triggered), registering collective output reference.
    *   **Query Functions:** (7 functions) Check membership status, get stake, get contribution score, get collective vibe, get project details, get proposal details, get claimable revenue.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(address _stakingToken)`: Initializes the contract with the address of the ERC20 token used for staking and governance weight.
*   `stakeToJoin(uint256 amount)`: User stakes tokens to signal interest and gain eligibility to request membership. Locks tokens.
*   `requestMembership()`: A staker formally requests to become a full member, initiating a governance vote.
*   `voteOnMembershipRequest(address candidate, bool approve)`: Active members vote on a membership request proposal.
*   `onboardMember(address candidate)`: Executes a successful membership request proposal, transitions candidate to active member status. Unlocks/transfers stake if required.
*   `initiateExit()`: Active member signals intent to leave, potentially locking their stake for a cooldown period.
*   `finalizeExit()`: After the cooldown, the member can withdraw their stake and associated tokens.
*   `adjustStake(uint256 newAmount)`: Member increases or decreases their active stake (subject to governance rules/cooldowns).
*   `proposeGeneric(bytes memory proposalData, uint256 proposalType, string memory description)`: Members create a new proposal. `proposalData` contains parameters specific to the type (e.g., new governance params, project details, member address for slashing).
*   `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Members cast their weighted vote on an active proposal. Weight is based on stake and potentially contribution score.
*   `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has passed the voting period and met governance thresholds. Contains internal logic based on `proposalType`.
*   `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: The proposer can cancel their proposal before the voting period ends (potentially with a penalty).
*   `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Members can delegate their voting weight to another address.
*   `setGovernanceParams(uint256 votingPeriod, uint256 quorumNumerator, uint256 proposalThreshold, uint256 exitCooldown, uint256 epochDuration)`: Governance function (executed via proposal) to update core protocol parameters.
*   `proposeProject(string memory name, string memory description, uint256 requestedBudget)`: Members propose a new collective project, requesting funds from the treasury. This is a specific `proposalType`.
*   `submitContributionProof(uint256 projectId, string memory proofUri, string memory description)`: Members submit off-chain proof (e.g., IPFS hash) of their contribution to a specific project. Records the submission.
*   `registerProjectOutcome(uint256 projectId, string memory outcomeUri, bool wasSuccessful)`: A governance-approved action to mark a project as complete and register its outcome and success status.
*   `registerProjectRevenue(uint256 projectId, uint256 amount)`: Allows transferring external revenue earned by a project into the contract, earmarking it for distribution related to that project.
*   `claimRevenueShare(uint256 projectId)`: Members can claim their share of revenue registered for a project, based on their calculated contribution score for that project/epoch.
*   `depositTreasury()`: External parties can send funds (in the staking token or potentially other approved tokens) to the collective treasury.
*   `initiateTreasuryWithdrawal(uint256 amount, address recipient)`: Governance proposal type to request withdrawal of funds from the treasury.
*   `distributeRevenue(uint256 projectId)`: An internal or governance-triggered function to calculate and make claimable the revenue shares for a specific project based on epoch contributions.
*   `triggerEpochProcessing()`: A function that can be called (potentially by a trusted oracle or via governance) to finalize an epoch, calculate/update contribution scores, and update the collective vibe.
*   `updateCollectiveVibe()`: An internal function, typically called during epoch processing, that adjusts the `collectiveVibe` parameter based on recent collective activity metrics (e.g., successful proposals, project outcomes).
*   `registerCollectiveOutput(uint256 projectId, string memory outputUri, string memory outputType)`: Records a reference to a significant creative output produced by the collective (e.g., final art piece IPFS hash, music track link).
*   `isMember(address account)`: Query function: Checks if an address is currently an active member.
*   `getMemberStake(address account)`: Query function: Returns the total stake held by an account (active + locked).
*   `getContributionScore(address account)`: Query function: Returns the current cumulative contribution score for a member.
*   `getCollectiveVibe()`: Query function: Returns the current value of the dynamic `collectiveVibe` parameter.
*   `getProjectDetails(uint256 projectId)`: Query function: Returns stored details about a specific project.
*   `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Query function: Returns the state and details of a specific proposal.
*   `getClaimableRevenue(address account, uint256 projectId)`: Query function: Calculates the amount of revenue currently claimable by a member for a specific project.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Creative Collective (DACC):** A DAO specifically focused on creative output, moving beyond just financial protocols or simple treasuries.
2.  **Staged Membership:** Membership isn't instant. It requires staking, a formal request, and a governance vote, adding friction and commitment.
3.  **Dynamic Stake:** Members can adjust their stake, influencing their voting weight and potentially contribution score multipliers (though the latter is simplified in this code).
4.  **Contribution Tracking & Scoring:** While the scoring logic is a placeholder (based on submission count), the *mechanism* for submitting on-chain proofs and linking them to projects is present. The concept of a `contributionScore` as a core metric for value distribution is key.
5.  **Revenue Sharing by Contribution:** The `claimableRevenue` mapping and `claimRevenueShare` function demonstrate a model where revenue earned by the collective (specifically linked to projects via `registerProjectRevenue`) can be distributed to contributors based on their work tracked via the contract.
6.  **Parametric Governance:** Key parameters (`votingPeriod`, `quorumNumerator`, etc.) are not fixed but are state variables that can be updated *by governance itself* via the `UpdateGovernanceParams` proposal type. This makes the DAO highly adaptable.
7.  **Stake/Contribution Weighted Voting:** Voting power is primarily based on active stake. A more advanced version could factor in the `contributionScore` as well. Delegation is also included.
8.  **Dynamic Collective Vibe:** The `collectiveVibe` is a parametric state variable intended to reflect the collective's health, morale, or activity level. While the update logic is simple here, it represents a concept where the DAO's environment or rules could dynamically adjust based on its own performance (e.g., a high vibe could lower proposal thresholds, a low vibe could increase exit fees). This adds a "game-like" or "organic" element to the DAO's on-chain state.
9.  **Epoch Processing:** The `triggerEpochProcessing` function introduces a time-based or event-based batch processing mechanism. Instead of calculating scores or distributing revenue instantly, it finalizes contributions, updates cumulative scores, adjusts the vibe, and potentially allocates claimable revenue periodically (e.g., monthly). This is common in complex protocols to manage computation and distribute rewards.
10. **On-chain Output Registration:** `registerCollectiveOutput` allows the DAO to officially recognize and record references to creative works it produces, even if the works themselves live off-chain or in other protocols (like NFTs on OpenSea, or IPFS). This creates an immutable on-chain registry of the DAO's creative portfolio.
11. **Flexible Proposal Types:** The `proposeGeneric` function combined with the `ProposalType` enum and `proposalData` allows for extending the DAO's capabilities via governance. New types of proposals can be added and handled in the `executeProposal` function without changing the core proposal/voting logic.
12. **Internal Execution Functions:** Functions like `onboardMember`, `_updateCollectiveVibe`, and the intended use of `distributeRevenue` and `registerProjectOutcome` are designed to be called *internally* by the `executeProposal` or `triggerEpochProcessing` functions, ensuring critical state changes are only made through the proper governance or epoch processes, not direct calls. (Placeholders with `revert DACC__Unauthorized` are added for direct calls).
13. **Custom Errors:** Using `error` instead of `require` saves gas in failed transactions, which is a modern best practice.
14. **SafeMath:** Using SafeMath (or Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow checks) is standard but essential for financial operations.
15. **Minimal External Dependencies:** Uses only OpenZeppelin's IERC20 and SafeMath (which could be replaced by native checks in 0.8+), avoiding reliance on complex external libraries not central to the creative/governance logic.

This contract provides a framework for a sophisticated, creative-focused DAO that goes beyond basic token transfers and voting, incorporating elements of reputation, dynamic state, and programmatic revenue sharing linked to contributions.
