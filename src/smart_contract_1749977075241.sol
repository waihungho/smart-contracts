Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a touch of "quantum state" uncertainty and an auction mechanism. The core idea is a "Quantum State Auction" where you bid on an NFT whose final properties or appearance are *not* fully determined until after the auction ends and the winner "observes" it, causing its state to "collapse" into one of several potential outcomes.

This leverages:
1.  **NFTs:** Standard trendy asset.
2.  **Auction:** A common smart contract pattern.
3.  **"Quantum State" Simulation:** Representing an asset existing in a superposition of states until an event (claiming/observation) collapses it. This is simulated using on-chain pseudo-randomness.
4.  **Complexity/Functions:** Managing auctions, bids, NFT states, claims, refunds, ownership, pausing, etc., will easily exceed 20 functions.
5.  **Novelty:** While auctions and NFTs are common, combining them with a probabilistic state collapse mechanism *for the asset itself* determined *at the moment of claim* is a less explored pattern, especially when integrated directly into the auction and NFT lifecycle within a single contract. We will implement minimal ERC721 logic internally rather than inheriting a full standard library to adhere to the "no duplication of open source" spirit for the core logic.

---

**Outline:**

*   **Contract:** `QuantumAuction`
*   **Purpose:** Manages auctions for "Quantum State Items" (QS-Items), which are unique NFTs whose final state (properties/metadata) is determined probabilistically upon being claimed by the auction winner.
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   QS-Item: An NFT with a set of potential states.
    *   Superposition: The state of a QS-Item before collapse (exists as one of multiple possibilities).
    *   Collapse: The process triggered by the winner claiming the item, determining its final state based on on-chain pseudo-randomness.
    *   Auction: Standard English auction mechanism for a single QS-Item.
    *   Pseudo-randomness: Uses block data for state collapse (inherent blockchain limitation, explained in comments).
*   **Key Structures:**
    *   `QSItem`: Stores potential states, final state index, collapsed status, and item owner (minimal ERC721 data).
    *   `Auction`: Stores auction state, seller, item ID, timestamps, highest bid/bidder.
*   **Enums:** `AuctionState`
*   **Events:** Track key actions (AuctionCreated, BidPlaced, AuctionEnded, StateCollapsed, ItemClaimed, etc.).
*   **State Variables:** Mappings for items, auctions, balances for refunds, internal item ownership tracking.
*   **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`.
*   **Functions (20+):**
    *   **Admin/Setup:** Constructor, Ownership management, Pause/Unpause, Withdrawals.
    *   **QS-Item Management:** Internal minting, Getting item details, Checking collapse status/states.
    *   **Auction Management:** Create, Cancel, Get auction details, List auctions.
    *   **Bidding:** Place bid, Get bid details.
    *   **Auction Resolution:** End auction, Claim item/Collapse state, Refund losing bidders.
    *   **Minimal ERC721 Compatibility (within contract):** `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `tokenURI`.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Sets the contract owner.
2.  `createAuction(uint256 _itemId, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, string[] memory _potentialStatesURI)`: Creates a new auction for a QS-Item, defining its potential states. The contract mints the QS-Item internally.
3.  `cancelAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Allows the seller (or owner before any bids) to cancel an auction.
4.  `placeBid(uint256 _auctionId)`: Allows a user to place a bid on an active auction. Must be higher than the current highest bid.
5.  `endAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Can be called by anyone after the auction end time to finalize the auction, determine the winner, and make items claimable.
6.  `claimItemAndCollapseState(uint256 _auctionId)`: Called by the winning bidder after the auction ends. Transfers the QS-Item NFT to the winner and triggers the state collapse mechanism, assigning a final state to the item.
7.  `refundLosingBidder(uint256 _auctionId, address _bidder)`: Allows a losing bidder to claim their bid amount back after the auction has ended.
8.  `_mintQSItem(uint256 _itemId, address _to, string[] memory _potentialStatesURI)`: Internal function to create and assign a new QS-Item.
9.  `_transferQSItem(address _from, address _to, uint256 _itemId)`: Internal function to transfer item ownership.
10. `_collapseState(uint256 _itemId)`: Internal function to determine and set the final state of a QS-Item using pseudo-randomness.
11. `getAuctionDetails(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to retrieve details about a specific auction.
12. `getQSItemDetails(uint256 _itemId)`: View function to retrieve details about a specific QS-Item, including its potential or final state URIs.
13. `getPotentialStates(uint256 _itemId)`: View function returning the list of potential state URIs for an item.
14. `getFinalState(uint256 _itemId)`: View function returning the final state URI if the item's state has collapsed.
15. `isStateCollapsed(uint256 _itemId)`: View function to check if a QS-Item's state has been collapsed.
16. `balanceOf(address _owner)`: Minimal ERC721 view: returns the number of QS-Items owned by an address.
17. `ownerOf(uint256 _itemId)`: Minimal ERC721 view: returns the owner of a specific QS-Item.
18. `tokenURI(uint256 _itemId)`: Minimal ERC721 view: returns a metadata URI for the QS-Item, indicating superposition before collapse and the final state after collapse.
19. `getCurrentHighestBid(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to get the current highest bid amount.
20. `getHighestBidder(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to get the address of the current highest bidder.
21. `isAuctionEnded(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to check if an auction's end time has passed.
22. `getTotalAuctions()`: View function returning the total number of auctions created.
23. `getTotalQSItems()`: View function returning the total number of QS-Items minted.
24. `withdrawContractBalance()`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw accumulated Ether (e.g., from cancelled auctions where seller was refunded).
25. `pause()`: Allows the owner to pause the contract (disabling core functions).
26. `unpause()`: Allows the owner to unpause the contract.
27. `renounceOwnership()`: Allows the owner to renounce ownership.
28. `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Allows the owner to transfer ownership.
