/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Conceptual and Creative)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective where members propose, vote on, and collaboratively create digital art pieces.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I.  Core Collective Management:**
 *     1. `becomeMember()`: Allows users to become members of the DAAC, potentially with a membership fee or token requirement.
 *     2. `leaveMembership()`: Allows members to leave the DAAC.
 *     3. `viewMembershipStatus(address _member)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *     4. `listMembers()`: Returns a list of current DAAC members.
 *     5. `setMembershipFee(uint256 _fee)`: (Admin) Sets the membership fee.
 *     6. `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the current membership fee.
 *
 * **II. Art Proposal and Voting System:**
 *     7. `proposeArtIdea(string _title, string _description, string _artMedium, string _inspiration)`: Members propose new art ideas with details.
 *     8. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members vote on active art proposals (yes/no).
 *     9. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art proposal.
 *     10. `listActiveProposals()`: Lists currently active art proposals open for voting.
 *     11. `listCompletedProposals()`: Lists proposals that have been voted on and concluded.
 *     12. `executeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Admin/Governance) Executes a successful art proposal, moving it to the "in progress" stage.
 *     13. `cancelArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Admin/Governance) Cancels a proposal before voting ends.
 *     14. `setVotingDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: (Admin) Sets the voting period for proposals.
 *     15. `getVotingDuration()`: Returns the current voting duration.
 *
 * **III. Collaborative Art Creation & Contribution:**
 *     16. `contributeToArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId, string _contributionData)`: Members contribute creative elements (text, code snippets, ideas, etc.) to an active art piece.
 *     17. `viewArtPieceContributions(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Retrieves all contributions made to a specific art piece.
 *     18. `finalizeArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId, string _finalArtData)`: (Curator/Designated Member - Governance) Finalizes a collaborative art piece by submitting the compiled final art data (e.g., IPFS hash, link, etc.).
 *     19. `viewArtPieceDetails(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Retrieves details of a created art piece, including contributions and final art data.
 *     20. `listActiveArtPieces()`: Lists art pieces that are currently in the contribution phase (in progress).
 *     21. `listCompletedArtPieces()`: Lists art pieces that have been finalized.
 *
 * **IV.  Reputation/Contribution Tracking (Advanced - Conceptual):**
 *     22. `getMemberContributionScore(address _member)`: (Conceptual)  Calculates and returns a reputation score based on contributions and proposal success.
 *     23. `rewardTopContributors(uint256 _artPieceId)`: (Conceptual - Governance)  Distributes rewards to top contributors of a finalized art piece.
 *
 * **V.  Emergency & Governance Functions:**
 *     24. `pauseContract()`: (Admin) Pauses core contract functionalities in case of emergency.
 *     25. `unpauseContract()`: (Admin) Resumes paused functionalities.
 *     26. `setGovernanceAddress(address _newGovernance)`: (Admin) Changes the governance address.
 *     27. `getGovernanceAddress()`: Returns the current governance address.

**Explanation of Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** This contract outlines a framework for a community-driven art creation process. It moves beyond simple token or NFT contracts and explores collaborative creativity on the blockchain.

2.  **Membership-Based System:**  Introduces the concept of becoming a member to participate, potentially with a fee. This can be used to fund the collective or control access.

3.  **Art Proposal and Voting:**  Implements a basic governance system where members can propose art ideas and the community votes on which ideas to pursue. This is a core DAO concept applied to art creation.

4.  **Collaborative Art Creation:** The contract has functions for members to contribute to chosen art pieces. This is designed to facilitate a collective creative process. Contributions are stored on-chain (strings in this example, but could be more complex in a real-world application with off-chain storage links).

5.  **Curated Finalization:** The `finalizeArtPiece` function introduces a curation aspect. While the creation is collaborative, the final piece needs to be compiled or assembled. In this example, it's simplified to governance submitting a final art data link. In a more advanced version, this could involve a designated "curator" role voted by the community, or more automated assembly if the art form allows.

6.  **Reputation/Contribution Tracking (Conceptual):**  The `getMemberContributionScore` and `rewardTopContributors` functions are placeholders for more advanced features.  These are conceptual ideas to encourage participation and recognize valuable contributions within the collective.  Reputation systems and reward mechanisms are advanced topics often discussed in DAOs.

7.  **Emergency and Governance Controls:** Includes standard governance functions like `pauseContract`, `unpauseContract`, and `setGovernanceAddress` for security and control, which are essential for any robust smart contract.

**Trendy and Advanced Aspects:**

*   **DAO Concepts:**  The contract leverages DAO principles (decentralization, voting, community governance) to manage an art creation process. DAOs are a very trendy and evolving area in blockchain.
*   **Collaborative Creation:** The idea of a decentralized collective creating something together is inherently creative and aligns with the ethos of Web3 and community-driven projects.
*   **Beyond NFTs:** While not explicitly an NFT contract, the output of this contract (the finalized `artPiece` with `finalArtData`) *could* easily be integrated with NFT minting.  The `finalArtData` link could point to an NFT representing the collectively created art piece. This contract focuses on the *creation process* rather than just the tokenization.
*   **Conceptual Reputation System:**  The placeholders for reputation and rewards touch upon more advanced DAO and community governance models that are being actively explored and developed.

**Non-Duplication:**

This contract is designed to be a conceptual example and is not a direct copy of any specific open-source project I'm aware of. It combines elements of DAOs, collaborative content creation, and art, but in a unique way focused on a decentralized art collective.  Many open-source contracts focus on tokens, NFTs, DeFi, or basic DAOs. This contract attempts to apply DAO principles to a more creative and collaborative domain.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified for Example:** This contract is a simplified example. A real-world DAAC smart contract could be much more complex, especially in areas like:
    *   **Art Data Storage:**  This example uses strings for `contributionData` and `finalArtData`. In reality, you'd likely use IPFS hashes or links to off-chain storage for actual art files (images, audio, etc.).
    *   **Voting Mechanisms:** More sophisticated voting systems (quadratic voting, delegated voting) could be implemented.
    *   **Reward Systems:**  Implementing a robust and fair reward system for contributors would be a significant development.
    *   **Curator Role:**  A more defined and potentially voted-on curator role could be added for art piece finalization.
    *   **Scalability and Gas Optimization:**  For a real-world application, gas optimization and scalability would be crucial considerations.
*   **Security:** This is an example contract and has not been audited for security vulnerabilities. In a production environment, thorough auditing is essential.

This contract provides a foundation and inspiration for exploring more creative and advanced smart contract applications beyond typical token and DeFi use cases. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to enable new forms of decentralized collaboration and creative expression.
