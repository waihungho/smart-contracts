Okay, let's create a smart contract concept that is somewhat novel by combining several elements: a community-governed, dynamic NFT vault where the NFT's characteristics change based on the pooled assets, community activity, and on-chain state. This avoids direct duplication of standard vaults, DAOs, or simple static NFTs.

**Concept: The "AuraVault" Dynamic NFT**

This contract will represent a unique, single ERC721 NFT (let's say `tokenId = 1`). This NFT is collectively 'owned' and controlled by a community of members. The NFT doesn't just sit there; its on-chain 'aura' (represented by dynamic traits/metadata) changes based on:

1.  **Vault Contents:** The types and value of ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs held in the contract.
2.  **Community Activity:** Number of members, total reputation, proposal volume, voting participation.
3.  **On-Chain State (Simulated/Simplified):** E.g., block number, gas price (as a proxy for network activity), or even mock oracle data.

Community members can deposit assets, earn reputation, create and vote on proposals to manage the vault's contents, trigger metadata updates, or even call approved external contracts via governance.

---

**AuraVault Smart Contract Outline**

*   **Core Standard:** ERC721 (for the main Aura NFT)
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   Dynamic NFT (metadata changes based on contract state)
    *   Community Vault (holds ERC20s and ERC721s)
    *   Reputation System (on-chain points for members)
    *   Governance (proposal and voting system)
    *   Programmable Actions (governance can trigger arbitrary calls to approved contracts)
    *   Admin/Emergency Controls

**Function Summary**

1.  **`constructor`**: Initializes the contract, mints the single Aura NFT (ID 1) to the contract itself, sets initial admin.
2.  **ERC721 Standard Functions:**
    *   `supportsInterface`: Standard ERC165.
    *   `tokenURI`: **Dynamic Function.** Generates a URI based on the *current* contract state (vault contents, community stats, on-chain data). Calls internal logic to determine traits before generating the URI.
    *   (Other ERC721 functions like `ownerOf`, `balanceOf`, `transferFrom` etc. are less relevant as the NFT stays within the contract and ownership is communal via governance, but required by the standard). We only need `ownerOf` (will always return address(this)) and `balanceOf` (will always return 1 for address(this), 0 for others).
3.  **Vault Management (Deposits):**
    *   `depositERC20`: Allows users to deposit approved ERC20 tokens into the vault. Awards reputation.
    *   `depositERC721`: Allows users to deposit approved ERC721 NFTs into the vault. Awards reputation.
4.  **Vault Management (Withdrawals - Via Governance):**
    *   `createWithdrawalProposalERC20`: Member proposes withdrawing a specific amount of an ERC20 token.
    *   `createWithdrawalProposalERC721`: Member proposes withdrawing a specific ERC721 token.
    *   `executeProposal`: Executes any approved proposal (including withdrawals).
5.  **Community & Reputation:**
    *   `addCommunityMember`: Admin function to initially add members (could be changed to governance later).
    *   `getMemberReputation`: Views a member's current reputation points.
    *   `slashReputation`: Admin/Governance function to penalize a member.
    *   `getMemberCount`: Returns the total number of registered members.
6.  **Governance (Proposals & Voting):**
    *   `createExternalCallProposal`: Member proposes calling an approved external contract function.
    *   `createAuraTraitProposal`: Member proposes changing a specific parameter that influences the Aura NFT's traits (e.g., minimum value threshold for a certain trait).
    *   `voteOnProposal`: Allows members with reputation to vote on open proposals. Reputation weight can be used.
    *   `getProposalCount`: Returns the total number of proposals created.
    *   `getProposalDetails`: Views the details of a specific proposal.
    *   `getVotesForProposal`: Views the current vote count for a proposal.
    *   `isVoteEligible`: Checks if an address is currently eligible to vote (based on reputation, etc.).
7.  **Aura Dynamics Control:**
    *   `triggerMetadataUpdate`: Allows a permitted address (e.g., admin, or after governance vote) to trigger a refresh of the NFT's metadata URI. This recalculates the traits internally.
    *   `_calculateAuraTraitsInternal`: **Internal Dynamic Logic.** Determines the NFT's traits based on vault contents, community stats, and simplified on-chain data proxies. (This is the core "advanced" concept).
8.  **External Interactions (Via Governance):**
    *   `addApprovedTargetContract`: Admin/Governance function to allow interaction with a new external contract.
    *   `removeApprovedTargetContract`: Admin/Governance function to disallow interaction.
    *   `isApprovedTargetContract`: Checks if an address is whitelisted for governance calls.
    *   `callExternalContract`: **Executable via Governance.** Performs a low-level call to an approved external contract address with provided data.
9.  **Views & Getters:**
    *   `getTotalERC20Balance`: Gets the balance of a specific ERC20 token in the vault.
    *   `getOwnedERC721s`: Lists the ERC721 tokens held in the vault.
    *   `getNFTVaultValue`: (Simplified) Calculates a rough aggregate value of assets in the vault (e.g., based on predefined weights or mock prices).
    *   `getNFTTraitState`: Views the *currently calculated* traits state (without triggering a full metadata update).
    *   `getAdmin`: Returns the current admin address.
    *   `isPaused`: Returns pause status.
    *   `getNFTTokenId`: Returns the fixed token ID (always 1).
10. **Admin & Emergency:**
    *   `pause`: Admin can pause certain actions (deposits, voting, proposal creation).
    *   `unpause`: Admin can unpause.
    *   `changeAdmin`: Admin can transfer admin rights.
    *   `withdrawEtherAdmin`: Admin emergency function to pull accidentally sent Ether.

This structure provides more than 20 external functions and incorporates dynamic state, reputation, governance, and controlled external interaction into a single NFT-centric system.

1.  **Dynamic NFT (`tokenURI` and `_calculateAuraTraitsInternal`):** The core NFT metadata is not static. The `tokenURI` function, when called, would ideally point to an off-chain service that queries the contract's state (using `getNFTTraitState`). `getNFTTraitState` gathers metrics like total vault value, community reputation, block number (as a proxy for time/activity), and custom `auraTraitParameters`. The off-chain service then uses these inputs to programmatically generate the NFT's image and JSON metadata, reflecting the current state of the vault and community. `triggerMetadataUpdate` can signal to the off-chain service (e.g., by updating a stored URI hint or state hash) that the state has changed and new metadata should be generated/cached.
2.  **Community Vault:** The contract directly holds ERC20 and ERC721 assets contributed by members.
3.  **On-Chain Reputation:** A simple reputation system (`communityMembers` mapping) tracks points gained through contributions (deposits). This reputation is then used as voting power.
4.  **Governance System:** A structured proposal and voting mechanism allows the community (members with reputation) to collectively decide on actions, including withdrawing assets, changing NFT parameters, or interacting with other contracts.
5.  **Programmable Actions (Controlled External Calls):** The `ExternalCall` proposal type and the `approvedTargetContracts` whitelist allow the community, through governance, to trigger arbitrary function calls on other trusted smart contracts. This makes the vault extensible and capable of participating in DeFi protocols, interacting with other NFTs, etc., all under community control.
6.  **On-Chain State Influencing Off-Chain Art:** The state of the *smart contract* directly dictates the visual and metadata characteristics of the *off-chain* NFT art. This creates a live, evolving digital artifact tied to the on-chain community and assets.
7.  **Single NFT Representing a Collective:** Instead of each member getting a share token or individual NFT, one dynamic NFT represents the entire collective effort and vault. Ownership isn't via ERC721 transfer, but via participation and governance power within the contract.

**Limitations and Considerations (as this is a complex example):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Iterating through `communityMemberList` or mapping keys (`ownedERC721s` or `erc20Balances`) can become very expensive with many members or different token types. A production system would need more gas-efficient data structures (e.g., linked lists, tracking total reputation in a variable, requiring deposit/withdrawal of *specific* tokens vs. generic iteration).
*   **Real-World Value:** Calculating the true aggregate value of diverse ERC20s and ERC721s reliably on-chain requires price oracles, which add significant complexity and dependencies. The `getNFTVaultValue` function is a simplified placeholder.
*   **Off-Chain Metadata:** The dynamic metadata relies heavily on an off-chain service (an API or script) that listens to events or queries the contract state (`getNFTTraitState`) and serves the appropriate JSON metadata when `tokenURI` is requested by a marketplace or wallet.
*   **Security:** A full production DAO/Vault contract requires extensive security audits, reentrancy checks (used here, but needs careful application), access control, and potentially upgrades via proxy patterns.
*   **Reputation Logic:** The reputation system here is very basic. A real system might consider duration of membership, participation frequency, proposal success rate, etc.
*   **Error Handling & Edge Cases:** The code includes basic checks (`require`), but comprehensive error handling for all possible scenarios (e.g., token approvals, insufficient gas for external calls, re-entrancy in complex external calls) is crucial for production. The ERC721 `safeTransferFrom` helps with some reentrancy risks for NFT transfers.

This contract provides a blueprint for a dynamic, community-controlled asset wrapper represented by a unique, evolving NFT, going beyond simple static NFTs, standard token vaults, or basic DAO structures.
