 * @title Decentralized Dynamic NFT Gallery - "ArtVerse Nexus"
 * @author Gemini AI
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized NFT gallery with dynamic curation,
 *      community voting, AI-powered NFT recommendations, fractional ownership,
 *      and advanced social features. This contract aims to create a novel and
 *      engaging NFT experience beyond simple marketplaces.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. NFT Management & Gallery Setup:**
 *    - `createGallery(string _name, string _description)`: Allows users to create their own NFT gallery.
 *    - `setGalleryName(uint256 _galleryId, string _name)`:  Updates the name of a gallery (admin only).
 *    - `setGalleryDescription(uint256 _galleryId, string _description)`: Updates the description of a gallery (admin only).
 *    - `setGalleryTheme(uint256 _galleryId, string _theme)`: Sets a visual theme for the gallery (admin only).
 *    - `listNFTInGallery(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows NFT owners to list their NFTs in a specific gallery for display and potential fractionalization.
 *    - `removeNFTFromGallery(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows NFT owners or gallery admins to remove an NFT from a gallery.
 *
 * **2. Dynamic Curation & Community Voting:**
 *    - `voteForNFT(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows users to vote for NFTs to be featured in a gallery.
 *    - `getTopNFTsInGallery(uint256 _galleryId, uint256 _count)`: Returns the top voted NFTs in a gallery based on the voting system.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _galleryId, uint256 _durationInSeconds)`: Sets the duration for voting cycles in a gallery (admin only).
 *    - `startNewVotingCycle(uint256 _galleryId)`: Manually starts a new voting cycle (admin only).
 *    - `autoCuration(uint256 _galleryId)`: Implements a basic automated curation mechanism based on voting and potentially other metrics (admin/oracle trigger).
 *
 * **3. Fractional Ownership & NFT Shares:**
 *    - `fractionalizeNFT(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _shares)`: Allows the NFT owner to fractionalize their NFT into shares.
 *    - `buyNFTShares(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _shareAmount)`: Allows users to buy shares of a fractionalized NFT.
 *    - `sellNFTShares(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _shareAmount)`: Allows users to sell their shares of a fractionalized NFT.
 *    - `redeemFractionalNFT(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows share holders (with majority shares) to initiate the redemption of the original NFT (complex governance needed for full implementation).
 *
 * **4. AI-Powered Recommendations & Advanced Features:**
 *    - `requestNFTRecommendation(uint256 _galleryId, string _userPreferences)`:  Placeholder function to request NFT recommendations (requires off-chain AI integration via oracle or API).
 *    - `reportNFT(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string _reason)`: Allows users to report NFTs for inappropriate content (basic moderation).
 *    - `setModerator(uint256 _galleryId, address _moderator)`: Sets a moderator for a gallery to handle reports (admin only).
 *    - `banNFTFromGallery(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`:  Allows moderators to ban NFTs from a gallery based on reports.
 *    - `transferGalleryOwnership(uint256 _galleryId, address _newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of a gallery to a new address (current owner only).
 *
 * **5. Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *    - `getGalleryDetails(uint256 _galleryId)`: Returns details about a specific gallery.
 *    - `getNFTListingDetails(uint256 _galleryId, address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns details about an NFT listed in a gallery.
 *    - `withdrawGalleryFees(uint256 _galleryId)`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw accumulated fees (if any fee structure is implemented - not in this basic example).
