This smart contract, named **"Syntropic Nexus Protocol"**, envisions a highly adaptive, self-optimizing decentralized organization. It's designed to evolve its governance parameters and resource allocation strategies based on internal dynamics, external data (simulated sentiment oracles), and community engagement.

The core idea is **syntropy**: a tendency towards order and optimal organization. The protocol aims to become more efficient and responsive over time by periodically evaluating its state and adapting its rules. It integrates concepts from advanced DAOs, dynamic systems, and oracle-driven intelligence to create a living, evolving protocol.

### **Function Summary (27 Functions):**

**I. Core Protocol Management**
1.  `constructor(address _governanceTokenAddress)`: Initializes the contract, sets initial parameters, and links to the governance token.
2.  `updateProtocolParameter(uint256 _paramId, uint256 _newValue)`: Allows Nexus Agents to propose and update crucial protocol parameters (e.g., quorum, voting duration). Requires multi-agent consensus or a passed directive.
3.  `registerExternalContract(address _contractAddress, string memory _description)`: Allows the Nexus to track and potentially interact with approved external contracts, enabling broader ecosystem integration.
4.  `getCurrentEpochDetails()`: Returns comprehensive data about the current operational epoch, including duration left, accumulated sentiment, and current adaptive thresholds.

**II. Influence & Staking**
5.  `stakeForInfluence(uint256 _amount)`: Users stake their governance tokens to earn "Influence Points" and participate in governance. Influence scales with stake amount and time.
6.  `unstakeInfluence(uint256 _amount)`: Users withdraw their staked tokens. May incur a cooldown or forfeit recent influence for early unstaking.
7.  `delegateInfluence(address _delegatee)`: Users can delegate their influence points to another address, empowering expert voters or chosen representatives.
8.  `undelegateInfluence()`: Revokes current delegation, allowing the participant to use their own influence again.
9.  `getEffectiveInfluence(address _participant)`: Calculates the total influence an address possesses, including their own staked influence and any delegated influence received.

**III. Strategic Directives (Proposals)**
10. `submitStrategicDirective(bytes32 _directiveHash, uint256 _impactWeight, uint256 _executionTimeframe, string memory _ipfsLink)`: Propose a new strategic directive with a unique hash (referencing off-chain details), impact weighting (for adaptation mechanics), and IPFS link for comprehensive documentation.
11. `voteOnDirective(bytes32 _directiveHash, bool _for)`: Cast a vote (for/against) on an active directive using the participant's effective influence.
12. `abstainOnDirective(bytes32 _directiveHash)`: Cast an abstain vote on an active directive. Abstain votes count towards participation but not "for" or "against" outcome.
13. `executeDirective(bytes32 _directiveHash)`: Executes a passed directive. Only callable after the voting period ends and quorum/thresholds are met. Can be called by anyone.
14. `vetoDirective(bytes32 _directiveHash)`: Nexus Agents can initiate a veto on highly contentious, harmful, or technically flawed directives. Requires a multi-agent consensus and a separate voting mechanism amongst agents.

**IV. Adaptive Intelligence & Oracles**
15. `submitSentimentReport(int256 _sentimentScore, bytes32 _contextHash)`: (Callable by whitelisted sentiment oracles/reporters) External entities provide verifiable sentiment data related to specific contexts (e.g., market conditions, project news, community morale).
16. `triggerEpochAdaptation()`: Automatically or manually callable at epoch end. This function processes accumulated sentiment reports, evaluates past directive outcomes (success/failure), and adaptively adjusts certain protocol parameters (e.g., minimum quorum for next epoch, influence multipliers) to optimize future governance. This is the core "syntropic" function.
17. `proposeAdaptiveThresholdAdjustment(uint256 _paramId, uint256 _newThreshold)`: Allows a Nexus Agent to propose specific, granular threshold adjustments (e.g., a temporary reduction in voting duration for urgent matters), which then go through a simplified directive process.
18. `requestCrossChainInsight(uint256 _queryId, bytes memory _queryData)`: (Simulated via Chainlink CCIP or other oracle integration) Requests external data or insights from other chains or off-chain data sources to inform strategic decisions. The `_queryData` would contain details for the off-chain oracle.
19. `allocateNexusResource(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Allows the protocol (via a passed and executed directive) to allocate funds from its treasury to external addresses for specific, community-approved purposes.

**V. Nexus Agents & Roles**
20. `proposeNexusAgentElection(address _candidate, uint256 _termDuration)`: Initiates an election for a new Nexus Agent, who has specific operational roles and responsibilities (e.g., veto power, emergency protocol activation).
21. `voteForNexusAgent(address _candidate)`: Stakeholders vote for a Nexus Agent candidate using their influence points.
22. `confirmNexusAgentElection(address _candidate)`: Finalizes the election based on majority influence, assigns the Nexus Agent role, and sets their term duration.
23. `removeNexusAgent(address _agentAddress)`: Allows a super-majority vote of other Nexus Agents or a specific, high-threshold directive to remove an agent due to misconduct or inactivity.

**VI. Advanced & Strategic Features**
24. `activateEmergencyProtocol()`: Triggered by severe negative sentiment trends or critical protocol parameter breaches (detected by `triggerEpochAdaptation` or direct Nexus Agent call). This function temporarily locks certain non-critical protocol actions, potentially diverts resources for immediate crisis resolution, and grants special powers to Nexus Agents, bypassing some governance for rapid response.
25. `predictDirectiveOutcome(bytes32 _directiveHash)`: (Read-only) Uses current voting trends, total influence allocated, and historical data to provide a real-time probabilistic estimate of a directive's final outcome (e.g., "70% chance of passing"). This function provides strategic insight for voters.
26. `initiateParameterAudit(uint256 _paramId)`: Allows any participant to flag a specific protocol parameter for community review and debate. This can lead to a formal directive to adjust it if inconsistencies, inefficiencies, or unintended consequences are found.
27. `distributeEpochIncentives()`: At the end of an epoch, distribute token incentives from a dedicated pool to highly engaged participants (active voters, successful proposers, accurate sentiment reporters) based on their activity, influence used, and positive impact within the epoch. This rewards active participation and aligns incentives.
