Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a Decentralized Algorithmic Fund (DAF).

This contract implements a system where users can deposit a specific ERC-20 token into a fund. The fund's total value is managed based on an "algorithmic strategy" which involves allocating funds among a whitelist of approved external addresses (simulating interactions with yield protocols, vaults, etc., based on configurable weights). The strategy execution and key fund parameters are governed by a simple share-based voting mechanism. It includes concepts like share price tracking, management and performance fees, pausing, and governance.

It aims for complexity by combining:
1.  **Algorithmic Strategy Simulation:** On-chain logic for *how* funds are allocated based on governed parameters (weights).
2.  **Share-Based Ownership:** Users get shares representing proportional ownership.
3.  **Dynamic Share Price:** Value per share fluctuates based on fund performance.
4.  **Performance Fees:** Calculating fees based on profit above a high-water mark.
5.  **On-Chain Governance:** Shareholders can propose and vote on changes to strategy parameters, approved targets, and fees.
6.  **Role-Based Access:** Owner and Strategist roles with specific permissions.

This is a simplified model; real-world interaction with diverse protocols would require much more complex ABI encoding and external call handling.
