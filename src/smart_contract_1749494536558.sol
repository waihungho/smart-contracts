Okay, let's design a sophisticated Decentralized Identity (DID) and Reputation Passport contract that integrates concepts like verifiable credentials, zero-knowledge proof verification status integration, on-chain reputation based on verified claims, and a simple social graph. It avoids simply replicating common token or NFT standards.

Here is the Solidity code with the outline and function summary.

// --- Contract: DecentralizedIdentityPassport ---
// Description:
// This contract serves as a decentralized identity and reputation passport for users
// on the blockchain. Users can receive verifiable credentials issued by trusted parties,
// manage privacy settings for their credentials, build an on-chain reputation score
// based on the verification status of certain claim types (potentially from off-chain
// ZK proof verifiers), and establish simple social connections with other users.
// It acts as a central registry for identity claims and their associated metadata,
// facilitating trust and interaction in a decentralized environment.

// --- Outline ---
// 1.  State Variables & Data Structures
//     -   Credential Struct: Represents a verifiable claim issued to a user.
//     -   Mappings:
//         -   `userCredentials`: Stores credentials mapped by owner address and a unique credential hash.
//         -   `userCredentialHashes`: Lists all credential hashes for a given owner.
//         -   `userProfileHashes`: Stores a hash representing off-chain user profile data.
//         -   `userDelegates`: Allows an owner to delegate certain actions to other addresses.
//         -   `trustedIssuers`: Addresses allowed to issue credentials.
//         -   `trustedVerifiers`: Addresses allowed to report ZK verification status.
//         -   `zkProofVerificationStatuses`: Stores the validity status of ZK proofs identified by a hash.
//         -   `reputationScores`: Stores the reputation score for each user.
//         -   `reputationBoosts`: Defines how much reputation boost specific claim types provide upon successful verification.
//         -   `connections`: Stores social connections between users by connection type.
//     -   Counters/Hashes: Used for unique identifiers or data integrity checks.
//
// 2.  Events
//     -   `CredentialIssued`: Emitted when a new credential is added.
//     -   `CredentialRevoked`: Emitted when a credential is marked as revoked.

//     -   `TrustedIssuerAdded`, `TrustedIssuerRemoved`: Emitted when trusted issuers are managed.
//     -   `TrustedVerifierAdded`, `TrustedVerifierRemoved`: Emitted when trusted verifiers are managed.
//     -   `ZKProofVerificationStatusAdded`: Emitted when a ZK proof verification status is reported.
//     -   `ReputationUpdated`: Emitted when a user's reputation score changes.
//     -   `ReputationBoostConfigUpdated`: Emitted when reputation boost configuration changes.
//     -   `ConnectionAdded`, `ConnectionRemoved`: Emitted when social connections are managed.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized Identity (DID) Core:** The contract centers around tying verifiable claims (`Credentials`) and reputation (`reputationScores`) to a blockchain address, acting as a DID. Users own and control access to their identity data representation on-chain.
2.  **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** The `Credential` struct and the `issueCredential` function mimic the core concept of VCs issued by trusted parties. The `claimTypeHash` and `claimDataHash` allow flexible off-chain data structures to be anchored on-chain without storing sensitive information publicly.
3.  **Selective Disclosure / Privacy:** The `isPrivate` flag on credentials and the access control in `getCredentialDetails` allow users to control who can see specific credentials on-chain, a key aspect of privacy-preserving identity systems.
4.  **ZK Proof Verification Status Integration:** Instead of performing complex ZK verification on-chain (which is gas-intensive and depends on specific ZK circuits/curves), the contract *receives and records* the result of an off-chain ZK verification via the `addZKProofVerificationStatus` function, callable only by trusted verifiers. This is a common pattern in integrating ZK proofs with smart contracts where the heavy computation is off-chain. The `proofIdentifier` links the on-chain status to a specific off-chain proof.
5.  **On-Chain Reputation System:** The `reputationScores` mapping and the `_processSuccessfulVerification` function build a quantifiable reputation score directly on the blockchain. This score is specifically tied to the *successful verification status* of certain claim types configured by the contract owner (`reputationBoosts`). This makes reputation more robust than simple token holdings or interaction counts, as it's based on verified assertions about the user.
6.  **Delegation:** The `addDelegate` and `removeDelegate` functions allow users to authorize other addresses (e.g., a different wallet, a smart contract wallet, or a service) to manage aspects of their identity on their behalf, enhancing usability and interoperability.
7.  **Simple On-Chain Social Graph:** The `connections` mapping allows users to establish directional relationships with other users, categorized by `connectionTypeHash`. This lays the groundwork for decentralized social features or network analysis based on verified identities.

**Why this is "Not Duplicative of Open Source":**

While individual *concepts* (like Ownable, Pausable, basic credential representation) exist in open source, a single contract combining *all* these specific features – on-chain DID anchoring, detailed credential metadata with privacy, ZK verification *status* integration for specific proofs, reputation directly linked to *verified* claims via configurable boosts, and a flexible connection graph – is not a standard ERC token, NFT, or a commonly found single open-source contract implementation. It pulls together elements from various advanced crypto use cases into a cohesive identity system.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a dApp building identity, reputation, or verified social layers on the blockchain. Remember that sensitive credential *data* itself should remain off-chain, with only a hash stored on-chain for integrity checks and proof verification.
