Okay, here is a smart contract implementation in Solidity featuring an Advanced Decentralized Exchange concept utilizing Algorithmic Tiered Bonding Curves, Staking, and Governance integration.

This contract manages a `CurvedToken` (`CRT`) whose price against a `ReserveToken` (`RST`, e.g., WETH or a stablecoin) is determined by a dynamic, tiered bonding curve based on the `CRT` supply. It includes features like dynamic fees, staking of `CRT` to earn `RST` fees, and governance-controlled parameter updates.

It avoids replicating standard Uniswap/Balancer AMM models directly by using a bonding curve where trades happen directly with the contract's reserves, and introduces complexity through tiered pricing and parameter algorithms.

**Smart Contract: AdvancedDecentralizedExchangeWithAlgorithmicBondingCurves**

**Outline:**

1.  **Core Concept:** A decentralized exchange mechanism for a single token (`CurvedToken`) against a reserve token (`ReserveToken`), using a dynamic, tiered bonding curve for price discovery and execution.
2.  **Bonding Curve:** Price is a function of `CurvedToken` total supply. The curve is defined by multiple tiers, each with a `basePrice` and `slope`. Trades are executed against the integral of the curve function over the trade amount.
3.  **Tiered Pricing:** The price function changes based on predefined supply thresholds.
4.  **Algorithmic Parameters:** Future versions could make `basePrice`, `slope`, or fees dynamically adjust based on metrics like volume, volatility, or external oracle data (basic oracle integration included). Current version allows governance to update these.
5.  **Dynamic Fees:** Buy and sell operations include configurable fees, which can be updated by governance.
6.  **Staking:** Holders of `CurvedToken` can stake their tokens in the contract to earn a proportional share of the collected `ReserveToken` fees.
7.  **Governance:** Key parameters (curve tiers, fees, oracle address) are controlled by a designated `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` via AccessControl.
8.  **Slippage Control:** Buy and sell functions include slippage protection parameters (`_maxReserveAmount`, `_minReserveAmount`).
9.  **ERC20 Standard:** Interacts with standard ERC20 tokens for the Reserve Token and the managed Curved Token (which the contract mints/burns).
10. **Oracle Integration (Basic):** A placeholder for an oracle integration to potentially influence parameters, though implemented here as a simple address storage and a governance-triggered update mechanism.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract with token addresses, governance role, and initial parameters.
2.  `buy`: Allows users to buy `CurvedToken` by depositing `ReserveToken` according to the bonding curve price + fee.
3.  `sell`: Allows users to sell `CurvedToken` to the contract for `ReserveToken` according to the bonding curve price - fee.
4.  `stake`: Allows users to stake their `CurvedToken` to earn fees.
5.  `unstake`: Allows users to unstake their `CurvedToken`.
6.  `claimFees`: Allows stakers to claim their accumulated `ReserveToken` fees.
7.  `updateCurveParameters`: (Governance) Updates the `basePrices` and `slopes` for the bonding curve tiers.
8.  `updateTierParameters`: (Governance) Updates the `supplyThresholds` for the bonding curve tiers.
9.  `updateFeeParameters`: (Governance) Updates the buy and sell fee percentages.
10. `setOracleAddress`: (Governance) Sets the address of an external oracle contract.
11. `updatePriceMultiplierFromOracle`: (Governance) Calls the oracle to potentially update a multiplier affecting prices (basic example).
12. `getCurrentSupply`: (View) Returns the current total supply of the `CurvedToken`.
13. `getReserveBalance`: (View) Returns the current balance of `ReserveToken` held by the contract.
14. `getCurvedToken`: (View) Returns the address of the `CurvedToken`.
15. `getReserveToken`: (View) Returns the address of the `ReserveToken`.
16. `getBuyPrice`: (View) Calculates the *total* `ReserveToken` cost (including fees) to buy a specific amount of `CurvedToken` at the current state.
17. `getSellPrice`: (View) Calculates the *total* `ReserveToken` received (after fees) for selling a specific amount of `CurvedToken` at the current state.
18. `getCurveParameters`: (View) Returns the current base prices and slopes for tiers.
19. `getTierParameters`: (View) Returns the current supply thresholds for tiers.
20. `getFeeParameters`: (View) Returns the current buy and sell fees.
21. `getStakeBalance`: (View) Returns the amount of `CurvedToken` staked by a user.
22. `getClaimableFees`: (View) Returns the amount of `ReserveToken` fees a user can claim.
23. `getTotalStakedSupply`: (View) Returns the total amount of `CurvedToken` staked across all users.
24. `getGovernanceAddress`: (View) Returns the address currently holding the `GOVERNANCE_ROLE`.
25. `hasRole`: (View) Checks if an account has a specific role (from AccessControl).
26. `getRoleAdmin`: (View) Returns the admin role for a given role (from AccessControl).
27. `grantRole`: (Admin) Grants a role to an account (from AccessControl).
28. `revokeRole`: (Admin) Revokes a role from an account (from AccessControl).
29. `renounceRole`: (User) Renounces a role (from AccessControl).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Algorithmic Tiered Bonding Curve:**
    *   Instead of a simple `x*y=k` or linear price increase, the price `P` is a function of the total token supply `S`.
    *   `P(S) = basePrice_i + slope_i * (S - supplyThreshold_i)` where `i` is the index of the current supply tier.
    *   This allows for complex, non-linear price dynamics that can be tailored (e.g., make it cheap initially, then steepen significantly, then flatten out at high supply).
    *   Trades require calculating the *integral* of this piecewise function, which is implemented in `_calculateIntegral`. This is more complex than simple spot price calculations in standard AMMs.
    *   The curve parameters (`basePrices`, `slopes`, `supplyThresholds`) are state variables, allowing for dynamic adjustment (via governance).

2.  **Dynamic Parameters (via Governance/Oracle):**
    *   The core pricing and fee parameters are not fixed but can be changed.
    *   `updateCurveParameters`, `updateTierParameters`, `updateFeeParameters` provide hooks for governance to actively manage the market dynamics based on observed behavior or external factors.
    *   Basic `oracleAddress` and `updatePriceMultiplierFromOracle` demonstrate how external data could *algorithmically* influence the price function (e.g., a multiplier from a sentiment oracle could temporarily make the token cheaper/more expensive).

3.  **Integrated Staking and Fee Distribution:**
    *   Fees collected from trades (`RST`) are distributed to users who stake the `CurvedToken` (`CRT`).
    *   Uses a standard rewards-per-share pattern (`_feeAccumulatedPerShare`, `_rewardDebt`) for efficient and fair fee distribution among stakers, avoiding the need to calculate individual shares of a growing pool at every interaction.

4.  **Custom CurvedToken:**
    *   The contract assumes control over the `CurvedToken`'s supply through `mint` and `burn` functions, requiring a custom ERC20 implementation that grants a `MINTER_ROLE` to this contract. This contrasts with AMMs that swap existing tokens.

5.  **Slippage Control on Bonding Curve:**
    *   While bonding curves interact directly with the contract, large trades still move the price significantly. The `_maxReserveAmount` and `_minReserveAmount` parameters in `buy` and `sell` functions provide necessary slippage protection.

This contract provides a framework for an alternative exchange model that leverages the flexibility of bonding curves and integrates common DeFi elements like staking and governance in a cohesive way. It's distinct from typical `x*y=k` AMMs or order book exchanges.
