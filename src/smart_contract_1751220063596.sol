Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced, creative, and somewhat conceptual features inspired by ideas like quantum states, probabilistic outcomes, time dynamics, and complex access control, without being a standard copy-paste of existing templates.

We will create a **Quantum Treasure Vault** (`QuantumTreasureVault`) contract. Its core idea is that the vault's *accessibility state* can be in a state of "superposition" (uncertain) until an "observation" or "measurement" occurs, collapsing it into a definitive, potentially time-limited or condition-dependent state. It also includes features like probabilistic access attempts ("tunneling"), ephemeral (one-time-use) access grants, time-locked roles, and a "decoherence" mechanism if left untouched.

### Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumTreasureVault`

**Core Concept:** A vault whose access state can exist in multiple potential states (superposition) until a 'measurement' action collapses it into a single, resolved state. Access is then governed by this resolved state and other dynamic conditions.

**State Variables:** Manage ownership, paused state, balances, vault state (superposition/resolved), lock conditions, access parameters, roles, and timing.

**Enums:** Define possible states of the vault (SuperpositionState, ResolvedState).

**Events:** Announce key state changes, deposits, withdrawals, and access attempts.

**Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`.

**Functions:**

1.  **Constructor:** Initializes the contract, setting the owner.
2.  **receive():** Allows the contract to receive native ETH.
3.  **fallback():** Basic fallback, reverts if no other function matches.
4.  **pause():** Pauses the contract (Owner only).
5.  **unpause():** Unpauses the contract (Owner only).
6.  **transferOwnership(address newOwner):** Transfers ownership (Owner only).
7.  **renounceOwnership():** Renounces ownership (Owner only).
8.  **depositETH():** Deposits native ETH into the vault.
9.  **depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount):** Deposits a specified amount of an ERC20 token.
10. **withdrawETH(uint256 amount):** Attempts to withdraw native ETH. Requires successful access check.
11. **withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount):** Attempts to withdraw ERC20 tokens. Requires successful access check.
12. **getETHBalance():** Views the contract's native ETH balance.
13. **getERC20Balance(address token):** Views the contract's balance for a specific ERC20 token.
14. **enterSuperpositionState():** Admin function to transition the vault state back into superposition (requires current state to be resolved). Can have cooldown/cost.
15. **attemptQuantumAccess(uint256 userSeed):** The core "measurement" function. Triggers the resolution of the superposition state if active. Checks access conditions based on the resolved state and other parameters (time lock, entanglement, ephemeral access). Can consume ephemeral access. Increments failed attempts on failure.
16. **attemptQuantumTunneling(uint256 userSeed):** A probabilistic function to bypass locks, potentially succeeding based on a configured probability and pseudo-random factor. Costs resources (e.g., ETH or a fee).
17. **setTimeLockState(uint256 unlockTime):** Admin function to set a time lock condition for the ALREADY_RESOLVED state.
18. **setEntanglementState(address entangledKey):** Admin function to link access to possession/state of an "entangled key" (conceptually, represented by an address holding a certain token or having a specific role elsewhere, or simply as a required address match).
19. **setTunnelingProbability(uint16 probabilityBps):** Admin function to set the base probability (in basis points) of successful tunneling.
20. **setMeasurementCooldown(uint64 cooldownSeconds):** Admin function to set a cooldown period between `attemptQuantumAccess` calls for a user.
21. **setAttemptLockThreshold(uint16 threshold):** Admin function to set the number of failed access attempts before a user is temporarily or permanently locked out.
22. **grantEphemeralAccess(address user):** Admin function to grant a user a single-use access token.
23. **revokeEphemeralAccess(address user):** Admin function to revoke an unused ephemeral access token.
24. **grantTimeLockedRole(address user, string role, uint64 endTime):** Admin function to grant a user a specific role (e.g., "Observer") that expires at a certain time.
25. **revokeTimeLockedRole(address user, string role):** Admin function to revoke a time-locked role before its expiration.
26. **hasRole(address user, string role):** Views if a user currently holds a specific role (checking expiration).
27. **checkDecoherence():** Views if the vault state has decohered due to inactivity.
28. **triggerDecoherence():** Allows anyone to trigger state decoherence if the timer has elapsed, collapsing the state to a default (e.g., NOT_ACCESSIBLE), potentially paying the caller gas.
29. **getCurrentSuperposition():** Views the current potential states in superposition.
30. **getCurrentResolvedState():** Views the state after resolution, if any.
31. **getVaultLockStatus():** Views consolidated lock status (time lock, entanglement key).
32. **getEphemeralAccessStatus(address user):** Views if a user has an ephemeral access token.
33. **getUserMeasurementCooldown(address user):** Views the remaining cooldown time for a user's access attempts.
34. **getUserFailedAttempts(address user):** Views the number of failed access attempts for a user.
35. **setDecoherenceTimer(uint64 duration):** Admin function to set the period of inactivity before decoherence occurs.
36. **getDecoherenceTimer():** Views the decoherence duration.
37. **getLastInteractionTime():** Views the last time a state-changing interaction occurred.
38. **resolveStateDeterministic(uint256 factor):** Internal helper: determines the resolved state based on a pseudo-random factor and current conditions.
39. **_canAccess(address user):** Internal helper: checks consolidated access permissions based on resolved state, time locks, entanglement, ephemeral access, roles, cooldowns, and failed attempts.
40. **_generateQuantumFactor(address user, uint256 userSeed):** Internal helper: generates a pseudo-random factor using block data, user address, and seed. (Note: On-chain randomness is limited; this is for conceptual demo).

*(Note: We are already well over the 20 function minimum, ensuring we meet the requirement while exploring various concepts.)*

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Quantum Superposition Metaphor:** The `SuperpositionState` and `ResolvedState` enums, along with the `enterSuperpositionState` and `attemptQuantumAccess` functions, simulate a state that is uncertain until "measured" (`attemptQuantumAccess`). This is a conceptual analogy, not real quantum computing.
2.  **State Collapse (`attemptQuantumAccess`):** This function is the "measurement" that collapses the `SuperpositionState.POTENTIAL_ACCESSIBLE_UNCERTAIN` into one of the `ResolvedState` values based on a pseudo-random factor.
3.  **Pseudo-random State Resolution:** `_generateQuantumFactor` uses block data and user input to create a deterministic, yet practically difficult-to-predict factor that influences the outcome of state collapse via `resolveStateDeterministic`. (Crucially, this is *not* secure randomness for high-value use cases).
4.  **State-Dependent Access:** The `_canAccess` function's logic changes dramatically based on the `currentResolvedState`, demonstrating dynamic access control.
5.  **Probabilistic Tunneling (`attemptQuantumTunneling`):** A function that offers a small, configurable chance (`tunnelingProbabilityBps`) to bypass the standard access controls entirely, based on a pseudo-random outcome. It costs a fee (`msg.value`) per attempt.
6.  **Entanglement Metaphor:** The `entangledKeyAddress` state variable and its check in `_canAccess` represent a conceptual link or requirement where access depends on meeting a condition related to another "entangled" entity (here, simplified to matching an address).
7.  **Decoherence Mechanism (`checkDecoherence`, `triggerDecoherence`):** A feature where the vault state collapses to a default "NOT_ACCESSIBLE" state if no interaction (`lastInteractionTime`) occurs for a set duration (`decoherenceTimer`). This encourages users or bots to interact to maintain a potentially accessible state, preventing it from being permanently lost to inactivity in a specific resolved state. `triggerDecoherence` is public to allow anyone to perform this gas-costing action if conditions are met.
8.  **Ephemeral Access (`_hasEphemeralAccess`, `grantEphemeralAccess`, `revokeEphemeralAccess`, `_canAccess`):** Grants a user a one-time pass. The `_canAccess` function consumes this pass upon successful access if it's available, regardless of the resolved state.
9.  **Time-Locked Roles (`_timeLockedRoles`, `grantTimeLockedRole`, `revokeTimeLockedRole`, `hasRole`, `_canAccess`):** Implements a more complex access control where specific roles are granted for a limited time, and these roles can influence the outcome of the main access check (`_canAccess`).
10. **Failed Attempt Lockout (`_failedAttempts`, `attemptLockThreshold`, `attemptQuantumAccess`, `_canAccess`):** Tracks consecutive failed access attempts for each user and temporarily or permanently locks them out if they exceed a threshold, adding a security/anti-brute-force layer.
11. **Measurement Cooldown (`_lastMeasurementTime`, `measurementCooldown`, `attemptQuantumAccess`):** Prevents users from spamming the `attemptQuantumAccess` function by enforcing a waiting period between calls.
12. **Internal Helper Functions (`_canAccess`, `_generateQuantumFactor`, `resolveStateDeterministic`):** Structures the complex logic into modular, reusable internal components, improving readability and maintainability.
13. **Receive and Fallback:** Handles incoming native ETH and unexpected calls gracefully.
14. **ERC20 Integration:** Demonstrates interaction with standard ERC20 tokens using the IERC20 interface.
15. **Low-Level Calls for Withdrawal:** Using `call{value: amount}("")` for ETH withdrawal is a common pattern to help prevent reentrancy, although the primary guard is the `_canAccess` check before the transfer.
16. **State Updates as Interactions:** Recording `lastInteractionTime` on relevant state-changing functions to support the decoherence timer.

This contract provides a highly conceptual and complex state machine with multiple layers of dynamic access control, demonstrating creative use of Solidity features beyond typical token or simple vault examples. Remember that the "quantum" aspects are analogies implemented with classical logic and pseudo-randomness suitable for a blockchain environment.
