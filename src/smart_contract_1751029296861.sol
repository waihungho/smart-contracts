Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Dynamic Knowledge Curation Protocol". This protocol allows users to stake tokens to propose "Knowledge Fragments" (pieces of data, ideas, or metadata), and other users to stake tokens to "attest" to these fragments. Successful attestation leads to the minting of a dynamic NFT representing the curated knowledge, distribution of staked tokens as rewards, and the building of a user's on-chain reputation score, which can boost their staking yield and influence governance.

This contract combines elements of staking, curation markets, dynamic NFTs, on-chain reputation, and basic governance, aiming for a creative and advanced blend not commonly found as a single standard open-source implementation.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** DynamicKnowledgeCurationProtocol

**Concept:** A decentralized protocol for curating and validating digital "Knowledge Fragments" through a staking and attestation mechanism. Participants earn yield, build reputation, and mint dynamic NFTs representing validated fragments.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Knowledge Fragments:** Data structures representing proposed pieces of knowledge or metadata.
*   **Proposers:** Users who stake tokens to submit Knowledge Fragments.
*   **Attesters:** Users who stake tokens to validate/attest to proposed Fragments.
*   **Reputation:** An on-chain score based on staking duration, successful proposals, and successful attestations, boosting rewards and governance power.
*   **Dynamic NFTs:** ERC-721 tokens minted for successfully validated Fragments, whose metadata can potentially evolve (managed within this contract).
*   **Dual Token Model:** Utilizes a Stake Token (e.g., a stablecoin or standard ERC20) and a Protocol/Reward Token (e.g., a governance token) distributed as rewards.
*   **Governance:** Allows token holders (Protocol Token) to vote on protocol parameters.

**Function Categories & Summary:**

1.  **Initialization & Setup:**
    *   `constructor`: Deploys the contract, sets initial token addresses (Stake Token, Reward Token, NFT contract), and initial parameters.

2.  **Staking:**
    *   `stake`: Allows users to deposit Stake Tokens into the protocol's staking pool to earn yield and build reputation.
    *   `unstake`: Allows users to withdraw their Stake Tokens and earned Reward Tokens.
    *   `claimRewards`: Allows users to claim only their earned Reward Tokens without unstaking their principal.

3.  **Knowledge Curation (Proposing & Attesting):**
    *   `proposeKnowledgeFragment`: Users stake minimum Stake Tokens to propose a new Fragment with associated metadata hash (e.g., IPFS hash).
    *   `attestToFragment`: Users stake minimum Stake Tokens to attest to a specific proposed Fragment, contributing to its validation.
    *   `finalizeFragmentAndMint`: Callable when a Fragment meets the required attestation threshold. Distributes staked tokens, mints a dynamic NFT, and updates fragment status.
    *   `rejectFragmentByGovernance`: Allows governance to explicitly reject a proposed Fragment (e.g., for spam or off-chain violations).

4.  **NFT Management (Interfacing):**
    *   `getFragmentNFTId`: Returns the NFT ID associated with a finalized Knowledge Fragment.
    *   `getNFTMetadataURI`: Constructs and returns the metadata URI for a Fragment's NFT (pointing back to this contract or an associated service for dynamic data). *(Note: Actual NFT `tokenURI` function would be on the separate NFT contract, likely calling this via a view).*

5.  **Reputation Management:**
    *   `getReputationScore`: Calculates and returns a user's current reputation score based on their activity and staking history.
    *   `updateReputation`: Internal function called on relevant actions (staking, successful proposal/attestation, finalization) to update cached reputation or contributing factors.

6.  **Rewards & Yield Calculation:**
    *   `calculatePendingRewards`: Calculates the amount of Reward Tokens a user is currently eligible to claim, considering their stake, duration, reputation boost, and protocol reward rate.
    *   `distributeStakedTokens`: Internal function called on finalization to distribute staked tokens (proposer receives portion, attesters receive portion, some goes to pool/fees).

7.  **Governance:**
    *   `submitGovernanceProposal`: Allows eligible users (e.g., based on reputation or minimum Reward Token holding) to propose changes to protocol parameters (e.g., min stake, attestation threshold, reward rate).
    *   `voteOnProposal`: Allows Reward Token holders to cast votes for or against an active proposal.
    *   `executeProposal`: Callable after a proposal's voting period ends and passes the threshold, to apply the proposed parameter changes.
    *   `getGovernanceProposalDetails`: Returns details about a specific proposal.
    *   `getUserVote`: Returns a user's vote on a specific proposal.

8.  **Query & View Functions:**
    *   `getUserStake`: Returns a user's current staked amount.
    *   `getTotalStaked`: Returns the total amount of Stake Tokens locked in the contract.
    *   `getFragmentDetails`: Returns comprehensive details about a specific Knowledge Fragment.
    *   `getFragmentsByStatus`: Returns a list of Fragment IDs filtered by their current status.
    *   `getFragmentsByProposer`: Returns a list of Fragment IDs proposed by a specific address.
    *   `getAttestersForFragment`: Returns a list of addresses that have attested to a specific Fragment.
    *   `getProposerStakeForFragment`: Returns the amount staked by the proposer for a specific Fragment.
    *   `getAttesterStakeForFragment`: Returns the total amount staked by all attesters for a specific Fragment.
    *   `getFragmentStatus`: Returns the current status of a specific Fragment.
    *   `getProtocolParameters`: Returns the current configurable parameters of the protocol.
    *   `getMinStakeAmount`: Returns the minimum stake required for proposing/attesting.
    *   `getAttestationThreshold`: Returns the required number/value of attestations to finalize a fragment.
    *   `getReputationDecayRate`: Returns the rate at which reputation decays over time.
    *   `getRewardRate`: Returns the base rate for Reward Token distribution.
    *   `getGovTokenAddress`: Returns the address of the Reward/Governance Token.
    *   `getStakeTokenAddress`: Returns the address of the Stake Token.
    *   `getNFTContractAddress`: Returns the address of the associated dynamic NFT contract.
    *   `getFeeAddress`: Returns the address receiving protocol fees.
    *   `getProtocolFee`: Returns the percentage of staked tokens collected as protocol fees on finalization.
    *   `withdrawFees`: Allows the fee address (or governance) to withdraw accumulated protocol fees.
