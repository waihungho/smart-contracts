/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Governance & Reputation System
 * @author Bard (Example - Highly Conceptual and for Demonstration)
 * @notice This smart contract outlines a sophisticated DAO governance and reputation system,
 *         incorporating advanced concepts like quadratic voting, skill-based reputation,
 *         dynamic quorum, and on-chain dispute resolution. It's designed to be creative,
 *         trendy, and goes beyond typical open-source DAO examples by focusing on nuanced
 *         governance and member reputation.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I. Core DAO Structure & Membership:**
 *    1. `initializeDAO(string _daoName, address[] _initialMembers)`:  Sets up the DAO with a name and initial members. (Admin/Setup)
 *    2. `proposeMembership(address _potentialMember, string memory _reason)`:  Allows members to propose new members with a justification.
 *    3. `voteOnMembership(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on pending membership proposals.
 *    4. `revokeMembership(address _member, string memory _reason)`: Allows for proposal to revoke membership (with voting).
 *    5. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of DAO members.
 *    6. `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *
 * **II. Proposal & Voting System (Advanced Governance):**
 *    7. `createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes calldata _actions)`: Members create proposals with title, description, and executable actions (bytes data).
 *    8. `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support, uint256 _voteWeight)`: Members cast votes on proposals, with customizable vote weight (e.g., quadratic voting logic internally).
 *    9. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal, triggering the encoded actions.
 *    10. `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Allows cancellation of a proposal before voting ends (admin or proposer with justification).
 *    11. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Returns the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Passed, Failed, Executed, Cancelled).
 *    12. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a proposal.
 *
 * **III. Reputation & Skill-Based System:**
 *    13. `assignSkill(address _member, string memory _skill)`:  Admin function to assign specific skills to members.
 *    14. `removeSkill(address _member, string memory _skill)`: Admin function to remove skills from members.
 *    15. `getMemberSkills(address _member)`:  Retrieves the list of skills associated with a member.
 *    16. `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`:  Admin/Reputation Manager function to increase member reputation for contributions.
 *    17. `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Admin/Reputation Manager function to decrease member reputation (e.g., for misconduct).
 *    18. `getMemberReputation(address _member)`:  Returns the reputation score of a member.
 *    19. `getReputationThresholdForVoting()`:  Returns the minimum reputation required to participate in voting (dynamically adjustable).
 *
 * **IV. Dynamic Quorum & Advanced Features:**
 *    20. `setQuorumThreshold(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`: Admin function to adjust the quorum percentage required for proposal passing.
 *    21. `emergencyPauseDAO(string memory _reason)`: Admin function to pause critical DAO operations in emergencies.
 *    22. `resumeDAO(string memory _reason)`: Admin function to resume DAO operations after pausing.
 *    23. `submitContribution(string memory _contributionDetails, string[] memory _skillsClaimed)`: Members can submit proof of contributions, claiming relevant skills for reputation boost (requires review/validation process - placeholder for more complex system).
 *
 * **V. (Optional - Placeholder for Future Expansion)**
 *    24. `delegateVotePower(address _delegatee)`:  Allows members to delegate their voting power to another member.
 *    25. `requestDisputeResolution(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _disputeDetails)`:  Placeholder for a dispute resolution mechanism for proposals (e.g., integration with an oracle or external dispute resolvers).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **DAO Initialization & Membership:**
    *   `initializeDAO`: Sets up the DAO only once, preventing accidental re-initialization.
    *   `proposeMembership`, `voteOnMembership`, `revokeMembership`: Standard DAO membership management but implemented within a proposal and voting framework.

2.  **Advanced Proposal & Voting System:**
    *   `createProposal` with `bytes calldata _actions`: This allows for highly flexible proposals that can execute arbitrary smart contract function calls (within the scope of this contract itself in this example). This is powerful but requires careful security considerations in a real-world scenario to prevent malicious proposals.
    *   `castVote` with `uint256 _voteWeight`:  This is the entry point for implementing more advanced voting mechanisms. The example code includes comments about quadratic voting and reputation-based voting.  You would replace the `calculateVoteWeight` function with the actual logic for your chosen voting system.
    *   `executeProposal`: Demonstrates how to execute encoded actions.  **Important Security Note:**  Executing arbitrary bytecode can be very dangerous. In a production system, you would need to implement a much more secure and controlled way of defining and executing proposal actions (e.g., whitelisted functions, structured action objects).
    *   `cancelProposal`: Provides a mechanism to stop proposals before voting ends, useful in certain situations.
    *   `getProposalState`, `getProposalDetails`: Standard functions for retrieving proposal information.

3.  **Reputation & Skill-Based System:**
    *   `assignSkill`, `removeSkill`, `getMemberSkills`:  Introduces a skill-based system, allowing the DAO to track member competencies. This can be used for governance, task assignment, or reputation weighting.
    *   `increaseReputation`, `decreaseReputation`, `getMemberReputation`: Implements a reputation system. Reputation can be earned for positive contributions and lost for negative actions. Reputation can influence voting power, access to features, etc.
    *   `getReputationThresholdForVoting`: Sets a minimum reputation requirement for voting, encouraging active and reputable participation.

4.  **Dynamic Quorum & Advanced Features:**
    *   `setQuorumThreshold`: Allows the DAO admin to dynamically adjust the quorum percentage, making the governance more adaptable.
    *   `emergencyPauseDAO`, `resumeDAO`: Provides an emergency pause mechanism for critical situations, controlled by the admin.
    *   `submitContribution`: A placeholder for a more advanced contribution tracking and validation system. In a real DAO, this would likely be tied to a proposal and voting process to validate contributions and reward reputation/skills.

5.  **Optional Future Expansion (Placeholders):**
    *   `delegateVotePower`:  Commented out, but a common advanced feature in DAOs allowing members to delegate their voting rights.
    *   `requestDisputeResolution`:  A placeholder for integrating a dispute resolution mechanism, which is crucial for resolving conflicts within a DAO. This could involve oracles, external dispute resolvers, or internal voting processes.

**Trendy and Creative Aspects:**

*   **Reputation System:**  Reputation is increasingly recognized as important in decentralized communities to build trust and incentivize positive behavior.
*   **Skill-Based System:**  Allows for more nuanced governance by recognizing and leveraging the diverse skills of DAO members.
*   **Dynamic Quorum:**  Makes the DAO governance more flexible and responsive to changing conditions.
*   **Quadratic Voting (Commented):** The `calculateVoteWeight` function is designed to be easily extended for quadratic voting or other advanced voting mechanisms. Quadratic voting is a trendy concept aimed at fairer representation and mitigating whale influence.
*   **On-chain Actions (Bytes Encoding):** The `_actions` parameter in `createProposal` and `executeProposal` demonstrates the potential for on-chain execution of governance decisions, making the DAO more autonomous and transparent.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security is Paramount:** This contract is a conceptual example. In a real-world DAO, you would need to conduct extensive security audits, implement robust access controls, and carefully consider the security implications of executing arbitrary bytecode (especially with the `_actions` feature).
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For a production contract, you would need to optimize gas usage.
*   **Error Handling and Events:** The contract includes basic error handling (`require` statements) and emits events for important actions, which is crucial for off-chain monitoring and integration.
*   **Scalability and Complexity:**  This is a relatively complex contract. For very large DAOs, you might need to consider more advanced scaling solutions and potentially modularize the contract.
*   **UI/Off-chain Integration:**  A usable DAO requires a user interface and off-chain tools to interact with the contract, display proposals, cast votes, manage reputation, etc.

This example provides a solid foundation for a feature-rich and advanced DAO governance and reputation system. You can further expand upon these concepts and add even more creative functionalities based on your specific DAO's needs and goals.
