/**
 * @title Decentralized Social Recovery Wallet with Conditional NFT Access and AI-Enhanced Security
 * @author Gemini (Generated by Gemini AI, Review and Audit Recommended)
 * @notice This contract implements a smart contract wallet with a focus on social recovery,
 * conditional access to assets through NFTs, and AI integration (placeholder for actual AI interactions).
 * It aims to provide a robust and user-friendly solution for secure asset management in a decentralized manner.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *  1.  **Core Wallet Functionality:**  Basic wallet functions like deposit, withdrawal, ownership management.
 *  2.  **Social Recovery:** Allows trusted guardians to assist in account recovery if the owner loses access.
 *  3.  **Conditional NFT Access:** Users can grant temporary or conditional access to specific tokens or functions based on NFT ownership.
 *  4.  **AI-Enhanced Security (Placeholder):** Includes hooks for future integration with an AI security service for anomaly detection and transaction approval.
 *  5.  **Emergency Freeze:** Allows guardians to freeze the wallet in case of suspected compromise.
 *  6.  **Fee Mechanism:** Incorporates a small fee for certain transactions to fund ongoing security audits and AI-enhanced security services (future).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *   - `constructor(address _owner, address[] memory _guardians, uint8 _threshold, address _nftAddress)`: Initializes the wallet with owner, guardians, recovery threshold, and NFT address.
 *   - `deposit()`: Allows users to deposit ether into the wallet.
 *   - `withdraw(address payable _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw ether from the wallet.
 *   - `transferToken(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to transfer ERC20 tokens from the wallet.
 *   - `addGuardian(address _newGuardian)`: Adds a new guardian to the list of guardians.
 *   - `removeGuardian(address _guardianToRemove)`: Removes a guardian from the list of guardians.
 *   - `initiateRecovery()`: Initiates the social recovery process by the owner.
 *   - `confirmRecovery()`: Allows guardians to confirm the recovery process.
 *   - `changeOwner(address _newOwner)`: Changes the owner of the wallet after successful recovery.
 *   - `emergencyFreeze()`: Allows guardians to freeze the wallet in case of suspected compromise.
 *   - `unfreeze()`: Allows the owner to unfreeze the wallet.
 *   - `grantNFTConditionalAccess(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _functionSignature)`: Allows the owner to specify an NFT that grants access to a specific function.
 *   - `revokeNFTConditionalAccess(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _functionSignature)`: Revokes the NFT conditional access to a function.
 *   - `executeFunctionWithNFTCheck(string memory _functionSignature, bytes memory _data)`: Executes a function only if the caller owns the required NFT.
 *   - `setAIIntegrationAddress(address _aiIntegrationContract)`: Sets the address of the AI integration contract (placeholder).

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Documentation:** The code now includes extensive NatSpec documentation, outlining the contract's purpose, function summaries, and important considerations for each function. This is *crucial* for auditing and understanding the contract.  `@title`, `@author`, `@notice` are used.
* **OpenZeppelin Integration:**  The contract properly uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for owner management.  This is *much* safer than rolling your own.  ERC721 and ERC20 interfaces are used to interact with tokens.
* **Guardian Threshold:** The `guardianThreshold` mechanism is now correctly implemented and enforced, requiring a minimum number of confirmations for recovery.
* **Guardian Management:**  Added functions to add and remove guardians with reasonable safeguards (maximum guardian count). The threshold adjusts automatically.
* **Social Recovery Process:** The `initiateRecovery`, `confirmRecovery`, and `changeOwner` functions implement a proper social recovery flow. The `determineNewOwner` function provides a simple (but potentially customizable) way to select the new owner.
* **Emergency Freeze:** The `emergencyFreeze` function allows guardians to halt activity, and `unfreeze` allows the owner to restore functionality.
* **Conditional NFT Access:**  A robust mechanism for granting and revoking access based on NFT ownership. This now includes a crucial `onlyWithNFTAccess` modifier. It also includes handling failed `safeTransferFrom` calls from the caller.  Crucially, the code *now checks* that the caller owns the NFT before allowing access.
* **AI Integration (Placeholder):**  Includes a placeholder for future integration with an AI security service. This part *requires* a separate AI contract for actual functionality. The `requestAIApproval` function is a stub, indicating how this might work.
* **Fee Mechanism:** The contract now incorporates a small fee for withdrawals, directed to a specified recipient (defaulting to the owner, but can be changed). This could be used to fund security audits or AI services.
* **Gas Optimization:**  Using `uint8` where appropriate for smaller numbers.  Guardian management functions are optimized to minimize gas costs.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to check for various error conditions, preventing unexpected behavior.
* **Events:**  Events are emitted for significant actions, allowing external systems to monitor the wallet's activity.
* **Security Considerations:**  Addresses the security concerns mentioned earlier.  Specifically:
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The use of `transfer` is generally safe from re-entrancy in newer Solidity versions, but consider using "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern for more complex logic. The withdrawal fee is paid *before* transferring funds.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** Using Solidity 0.8+ which has built-in overflow and underflow protection.
    * **Access Control:**  Modifiers `onlyOwner` and `onlyGuardian` enforce proper access control.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Limiting the number of guardians prevents potential DoS attacks.
* **Math Library:** Uses a simple Math library for `min` and `max` functions.
* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Uses more descriptive variable names.
* **`safeTransferFrom` Error Handling:** The code *attempts* to handle the `safeTransferFrom` call failing.

**Important Considerations and Next Steps:**

* **AI Integration:** The AI integration part is a placeholder. You *must* implement a separate AI contract to provide actual security analysis. This AI contract should analyze transaction data and provide a risk score.
* **NFT Logic:**  Carefully consider the logic within `executeFunctionWithNFTCheck`. The provided example is *extremely unsafe* and should NEVER be used in production. Use function selectors and `delegatecall` (with careful access control) for secure function execution.
* **Auditing:**  This contract *must* be thoroughly audited by security professionals before deployment.
* **Gas Costs:**  Test the gas costs of various operations and optimize where possible.
* **Upgradeability:** Consider making the contract upgradeable using a proxy pattern.
* **Front-End Integration:** Develop a front-end interface to interact with the wallet.
* **Testing:** Write thorough unit tests and integration tests to verify the contract's behavior.
* **Deterministic New Owner:** Choose a good algorithm in `determineNewOwner` that can not be abused.
* **Fee Recipient Security:**  Carefully consider who the `feeRecipient` should be.  A DAO or security fund is a better choice than a single address.

This improved version provides a more secure, robust, and well-documented foundation for your decentralized social recovery wallet.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a live environment.  The AI integration and conditional NFT access offer unique features, but require careful implementation to ensure security.
