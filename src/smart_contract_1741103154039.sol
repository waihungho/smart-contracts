 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like
 *      dynamic pricing, community curation, artist reputation, fractional ownership (simulated), and more.
 *      This contract is designed to be unique and not directly replicate existing open-source projects,
 *      focusing on a creative combination of features for a modern, decentralized art ecosystem.
 *
 * --- Function Summary ---
 *
 * **Art Management:**
 * 1. `createArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows artists to submit new artworks to the gallery.
 * 2. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Artists can list their approved artworks for sale at a specific price.
 * 3. `unlistArtworkFromSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists can remove their artworks from sale.
 * 4. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artworks listed for sale. Implements dynamic pricing adjustment after purchase.
 * 5. `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curator function to approve submitted artworks for listing and sale.
 * 6. `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reason)`: Curator function to reject submitted artworks with a reason.
 * 7. `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reportReason)`: Users can report artworks for inappropriate content.
 * 8. `removeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Admin/Curator function to permanently remove an artwork after reports and review.
 * 9. `setArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Allows artist to update artwork title and description (only before sale).
 * 10. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Public view function to retrieve detailed information about an artwork.
 *
 * **Artist Reputation & Management:**
 * 11. `registerArtist(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio)`: Allows users to register as artists in the gallery.
 * 12. `updateArtistProfile(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio)`: Allows registered artists to update their profile information.
 * 13. `voteForArtist(address _artistAddress)`: Users can vote for their favorite artists, contributing to a reputation score.
 * 14. `getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: Public view function to retrieve the reputation score of an artist.
 *
 * **Gallery Governance & Community Features:**
 * 15. `becomeCurator()`: Allows users to apply to become curators (requires governance approval in a more advanced version, simplified here).
 * 16. `removeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Admin function to remove a curator.
 * 17. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Admin function to set the gallery fee percentage on sales.
 * 18. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Admin function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 * 19. `donateToGallery()`: Users can donate ETH to the gallery to support its operations.
 * 20. `getGalleryBalance()`: Public view function to check the gallery's ETH balance.
 * 21. `commentOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _comment)`:  Users can leave comments on artworks (basic, can be expanded with moderation).
 * 22. `getArtworkComments(uint256 _artworkId)`: Public view function to retrieve comments for a specific artwork.
 *
 * --- Advanced Concepts Implemented ---
 * - **Dynamic Pricing:** Artwork price slightly increases after each purchase to reflect popularity.
 * - **Community Curation (Simplified):**  Curators approve artworks, representing a decentralized curation process.
 * - **Artist Reputation:**  Voting system to build artist reputation based on community support.
 * - **Reporting Mechanism:** Users can report inappropriate content, enabling community moderation.
 * - **Gallery Governance (Basic):** Curator roles and admin-settable gallery fees represent basic governance.
 * - **Donations to Gallery:**  Allows community support for the platform's sustainability.
 * - **Comments on Artworks:** Fosters community interaction and discussion around art.
