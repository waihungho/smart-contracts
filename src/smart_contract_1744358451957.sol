 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit art,
 *      members to vote on art pieces, mint NFTs for approved art, participate in governance proposals,
 *      and contribute to a shared treasury. This contract features advanced concepts like reputation-based voting,
 *      dynamic curation rounds, and on-chain royalties management, offering a unique approach to art collaboration and governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Art Submission and Curation:**
 *    - `submitArt(string _ipfsHash, string _title, string _description)`: Allows artists to submit their art piece for curation.
 *    - `startNewCurationRound(uint256 _durationInDays)`: Starts a new curation round for art submissions. (Governance)
 *    - `endCurationRound()`: Ends the current curation round, tallying votes and processing results. (Governance)
 *    - `voteOnArt(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on art submissions during a curation round.
 *    - `getCurationRoundDetails()`: Returns details about the current or last curation round.
 *    - `getArtSubmissionDetails(uint256 _submissionId)`: Returns details of a specific art submission.
 *    - `isArtSubmissionOpen()`: Checks if art submission is currently open.
 *
 * **2. NFT Minting and Management:**
 *    - `mintNFT(uint256 _submissionId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved art submission. (Governance after curation)
 *    - `getNFTContractAddress()`: Returns the address of the deployed NFT contract for this collective.
 *    - `transferNFT(uint256 _tokenId, address _recipient)`: Allows NFT holders to transfer their NFTs. (Standard NFT function - example)
 *    - `burnNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows NFT holders to burn their NFTs. (Standard NFT function - example)
 *
 * **3. DAO Governance and Proposals:**
 *    - `proposeNewRule(string _proposalDescription, bytes _data)`: Allows members to propose new governance rules or actions.
 *    - `voteOnRuleProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `executeRuleProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal. (Governance after voting)
 *    - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific governance proposal.
 *    - `getMemberVotes(uint256 _proposalId, address _member)`: Returns a member's vote on a specific proposal.
 *
 * **4. Staking and Reputation System:**
 *    - `stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to stake platform tokens to increase voting power and reputation.
 *    - `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to unstake platform tokens.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Returns the reputation score of a member based on staking and participation.
 *    - `getTotalStakedTokens()`: Returns the total amount of tokens staked in the platform.
 *
 * **5. Treasury and Royalties Management:**
 *    - `depositToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to deposit platform tokens or Ether into the collective treasury. (Example - could be refined)
 *    - `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows governance to withdraw funds from the treasury. (Governance)
 *    - `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Sets the platform fee percentage for NFT sales (e.g., royalties). (Governance)
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective treasury.
 *
 * **6. Admin and Utility Functions:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Pauses certain contract functionalities for emergency situations. (Admin)
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Resumes contract functionalities after pausing. (Admin)
 *    - `setNFTContractAddress(address _nftContractAddress)`: Sets the address of the deployed NFT contract. (Admin - initial setup)
 *    - `setPlatformTokenAddress(address _platformTokenAddress)`: Sets the address of the platform's token contract. (Admin - initial setup)
 *    - `addMember(address _newMember)`: Adds a new member to the collective. (Governance or Admin - depending on membership model)
 *    - `removeMember(address _memberToRemove)`: Removes a member from the collective. (Governance or Admin - depending on membership model)
 *    - `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Concept:** The core idea is to create a community-governed platform for artists and art enthusiasts. This aligns with the trendy concepts of DAOs and creator economies.

2.  **Curation Rounds:** The `startNewCurationRound` and `endCurationRound` functions introduce a time-boxed period for art submissions and voting. This creates structured curation and prevents continuous submissions.

3.  **Reputation-Based Voting (Staking & Voting Power):** The `stakeTokens`, `unstakeTokens`, and `getMemberReputation` functions, along with `getMemberVotingPower`, implement a system where members who stake platform tokens gain more voting power. This is a more advanced voting mechanism than simple 1-person-1-vote, incentivizing commitment to the platform.

4.  **Governance Proposals and Execution:** The `proposeNewRule`, `voteOnRuleProposal`, and `executeRuleProposal` functions create a basic on-chain governance system.  The use of `delegatecall` in `executeRuleProposal` (while simplified for demonstration) illustrates a powerful (but also potentially risky and requires careful security consideration in real applications) technique for executing on-chain actions based on governance decisions.

5.  **Treasury Management:** The `depositToTreasury` and `withdrawFromTreasury` functions manage a shared treasury for the collective. This treasury could be used to fund platform development, reward active members, or for other collective purposes.

6.  **Platform Fee/Royalties:** The `setPlatformFee` function introduces a mechanism for the collective to earn a platform fee on NFT sales (or other transactions in a more advanced version). This fee can be directed to the treasury for collective benefit.

7.  **NFT Integration (Conceptual):** The `mintNFT`, `getNFTContractAddress`, `transferNFT`, and `burnNFT` functions (while simplified in this contract and relying on comments for NFT contract interaction) outline how this DAAC would integrate with a separate NFT contract. This demonstrates the interaction between a DAO and NFTs.

8.  **Admin and Utility Functions:** The `pauseContract`, `unpauseContract`, `setNFTContractAddress`, `setPlatformTokenAddress`, `addMember`, `removeMember`, `isMember`, and `getVersion` functions provide essential admin and utility features for contract management and information retrieval.

9.  **Modifiers for Security and Control:** The use of modifiers like `onlyGovernance`, `onlyAdmin`, `onlyMember`, `whenNotPaused`, `whenArtSubmissionOpen`, etc., enforces access control and contract state management, making the contract more robust and secure.

10. **Events for Transparency:**  The contract emits numerous events for important actions (art submission, voting, NFT minting, proposals, staking, treasury actions, etc.). Events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and building user interfaces that react to on-chain events.

11. **Fallback and Receive Functions:** The `fallback` and `receive` functions (optional, but included as an example) allow the contract to receive ETH directly, simplifying treasury deposits.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Not Production Ready:** This code is an example and **not intended for production use without thorough auditing and security review.**  It lacks proper error handling in some areas, and the `delegatecall` in `executeRuleProposal` is a powerful but potentially risky feature that needs careful consideration in real-world applications.
*   **NFT and Token Integration:** The integration with the NFT and Platform Token contracts is conceptual. In a real implementation, you would need to deploy separate NFT and ERC20 token contracts and integrate them with this DAAC contract using their actual interfaces and functions.
*   **Security:** Security is paramount for smart contracts. This example code needs a comprehensive security audit before deployment. Consider vulnerabilities like reentrancy, access control flaws, and gas optimization for real-world scenarios.
*   **Gas Optimization:** This code is written for clarity and demonstration, not for extreme gas optimization. In a production setting, you would need to optimize gas usage to reduce transaction costs.
*   **Scalability:** Some parts of the code (like `getCollectiveMembers` and `getMemberCount`) are not optimized for scalability if the number of members or submissions becomes very large. For a large-scale application, you would need to use more efficient data structures and algorithms.
*   **Advanced Features (Further Expansion):** You could further enhance this contract with features like:
    *   **Tiered Membership:** Different membership levels with varying voting power or access.
    *   **Curated Galleries:** On-chain galleries to showcase approved NFTs.
    *   **Revenue Sharing for Artists:** More sophisticated revenue sharing mechanisms for NFT sales.
    *   **Off-Chain Data Integration (Oracles):**  Potentially use oracles for external data, though for art curation, on-chain voting is generally preferred for transparency.
    *   **More Complex Reputation System:**  Incorporate more factors into reputation calculation beyond just staking (e.g., participation in proposals, successful art submissions, etc.).
    *   **Sub-DAOs or Working Groups:**  Allow for the creation of smaller groups within the DAAC to focus on specific areas.

This example provides a solid foundation and a good starting point for building a more advanced and feature-rich decentralized autonomous art collective smart contract. Remember to prioritize security, thorough testing, and proper auditing before deploying any smart contract to a live blockchain network.
