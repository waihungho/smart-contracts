Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Generative NFT Marketplace" incorporating several advanced and creative concepts: generative art template registration and minting, a full-featured marketplace (fixed price, auctions, offers, batch operations), creator revenue tracking, platform fees, basic staking, and a curator role concept.

It aims to be creative by tightly integrating the "generative" aspect into the marketplace functions, tracking creator revenue specifically tied to the generative templates, and including batch operations and a staking mechanism distinct from typical marketplaces. It avoids direct copies of standard OpenZeppelin implementations for core logic where possible, while still utilizing standard interfaces (like ERC721, ERC20) and safe practices (like SafeERC20).

// --- Outline and Function Summary ---

// This contract implements a Generative NFT Marketplace.
// It allows creators to register 'Generator' smart contracts (which implement IGenerator).
// Users can then mint NFTs by calling minting functions on this marketplace contract,
// which in turn interacts with the registered Generator contracts, passing parameters.
// The marketplace tracks the generator and parameters used for each minted NFT.
// It also provides a marketplace for these NFTs, supporting fixed price sales, auctions, and offers,
// with built-in support for platform fees and creator royalties that are tracked and withdrawable
// by the generator owners. Additional features include batch operations, staking, and a curator role concept.

// I. Core Generative Features
//    - registerGenerator: Adds a new IGenerator contract address as a valid template source.
//    - unregisterGenerator: Removes a registered generator.
//    - setGeneratorStatus: Activate/deactivate a registered generator.
//    - mintFromGenerator: Mints a new NFT by calling the specified registered generator.
//    - getNFTGenerationDetails: Retrieves the generator and parameters used for a specific token ID.
//    - getRegisteredGenerators: Lists all currently registered generator addresses.
//    - setGeneratorDefaultRoyalty: Sets a default royalty percentage for a generator.

// II. Marketplace - Listings (Fixed Price)
//    - listItem: Lists an owned NFT for a fixed price, specifying royalty details.
//    - unlist: Removes a fixed-price listing.
//    - buyItem: Purchases a listed NFT at its fixed price.
//    - batchListItems: Lists multiple owned NFTs for fixed prices.
//    - batchBuyItems: Purchases multiple listed NFTs.

// III. Marketplace - Auctions
//    - createAuction: Creates an auction for an owned NFT, specifying duration and royalty details.
//    - cancelAuction: Cancels an ongoing auction.
//    - placeBid: Places a bid on an active auction.
//    - settleAuction: Settles an auction after its end time, transferring NFT and funds to winner/seller/recipients.

// IV. Marketplace - Offers
//    - makeOffer: Makes an offer on any NFT (listed or not), specifying an expiry.
//    - cancelOffer: Cancels a previously made offer.
//    - acceptOffer: Accepts an offer made on an owned NFT.
//    - getOffers: Retrieves all active offers for a specific token ID.

// V. Platform Management & Fees
//    - setPlatformFeeRecipient: Sets the address receiving platform fees.
//    - setPlatformFeePercentage: Sets the percentage charged as platform fee on sales/auctions/offer acceptances.
//    - withdrawPlatformFees: Allows the platform fee recipient to withdraw collected fees.
//    - setMinimumBidIncrement: Sets the minimum percentage increase for new bids in an auction.
//    - setCuratorRole: Grants or revokes the curator role to an address. (Conceptual - for generator approval/review)

// VI. Creator Revenue & Withdrawals
//    - getGeneratorRevenue: Views the total revenue accumulated for a specific generator (from royalties).
//    - withdrawGeneratorRevenue: Allows the owner of a generator contract to withdraw their accumulated revenue.

// VII. Staking
//    - setStakingToken: Sets the ERC20 token used for staking on the platform.
//    - stake: Stakes the specified amount of the platform's staking token.
//    - unstake: Unstakes the specified amount of staked tokens.
//    - claimStakingRewards: Claims accrued staking rewards (placeholder logic - actual distribution mechanism would be more complex).
//    - distributeStakingRewards: Owner/Admin can distribute rewards to stakers (placeholder logic).

// Total Functions: 7 (Generative) + 5 (Listings) + 4 (Auctions) + 4 (Offers) + 5 (Platform) + 2 (Revenue) + 4 (Staking) = 31 Functions

// --- Interfaces ---

// Interface for Generator contracts this marketplace can interact with
interface IGenerator {
    // This function is called by the marketplace to mint a new NFT
    // It should handle its own internal logic (generating traits, tokenURI, etc.)
    // and call back to the marketplace (or just rely on marketplace to track)
    // For this simple example, it will return the newly minted token ID.
    // A real generative system might need more complex interaction or on-chain generation.
    function mint(address to, bytes calldata params) external returns (uint256 newTokenId);

    // Optional: Get the original creator/owner of the generator contract
    function owner() external view returns (address);

    // Optional: Get the ERC721 contract address this generator mints
    function nftContract() external view returns (IERC721);
}

interface IStakingRewards {
    // Minimal interface for interacting with a separate staking rewards contract
    // A real implementation would be more complex (e.g., distribution mechanics)
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 rewardAmount) external;
    function stake(address account, uint256 amount) external;
    function withdraw(address account, uint256 amount) external;

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts and Functions:**

1.  **Generative Integration (I. Functions):**
    *   `registerGenerator`, `unregisterGenerator`, `setGeneratorStatus`: Allows dynamic registration and management of external "Generator" contracts. This decouples the generative logic from the marketplace core, allowing for different algorithms or art styles to be integrated over time.
    *   `mintFromGenerator`: The marketplace acts as an intermediary for minting, calling the external generator contract. This allows the marketplace to track which NFT came from which generator and with which parameters (`_nftGenerationDetails`), creating a historical record and linking NFTs back to their generative source.
    *   `getNFTGenerationDetails`: Provides transparency into how a specific NFT was generated via the platform.
    *   `setGeneratorDefaultRoyalty`: Allows generator owners to set a *default* royalty, which is then used when listing NFTs from that generator. This ties creator royalties directly to the generative source.

2.  **Full-Featured Marketplace (II, III, IV. Functions):**
    *   Covers the standard trinity: Fixed Price, Auctions, and Offers. This breadth of functionality is more complex than a simple marketplace.
    *   Auctions include minimum bid increments (`setMinimumBidIncrement`).
    *   Offers can be made on *any* NFT, not just listed ones, providing more flexibility for buyers.
    *   Offer acceptance automatically handles unlisting/cancelling if the item was already for sale/auction.

3.  **Creator Revenue Tracking (VI. Functions):**
    *   `_generatorRevenue` mapping tracks accumulated royalty revenue specifically for the *owner of the generator contract* that produced the NFT sold (or offered).
    *   `withdrawGeneratorRevenue` allows generator owners to claim their share, separate from the seller's payout.

4.  **Platform Fees (V. Functions):**
    *   Standard platform fees are applied to all successful sales (fixed price, auction, accepted offer).
    *   Fees are accumulated in the contract and withdrawable by a designated recipient.

5.  **Batch Operations (II. Functions):**
    *   `batchListItems` and `batchBuyItems` add gas efficiency and convenience for users managing multiple assets. Handling multiple transfers and state updates in a single transaction adds complexity and requires careful consideration of gas limits (though basic `for` loops are used here for simplicity, optimized batching might use more advanced techniques).

6.  **Staking (VII. Functions):**
    *   Allows users to stake a designated ERC20 token (`_stakingToken`).
    *   `_stakedBalances` tracks individual stakes.
    *   `claimStakingRewards` and `distributeStakingRewards` provide *placeholder* functions for a staking reward mechanism. A real-world staking reward system (e.g., based on yield farming principles, revenue share distribution) is significantly more complex and would require a dedicated rewards contract or extensive logic within this contract (tracking time, calculating proportional shares, handling compounding, etc.). These functions show the *intent* to integrate staking rewards.

7.  **Curator Role (V. Functions):**
    *   `_isCurator` mapping and `onlyCurator` modifier introduce a role-based access control concept beyond just `Ownable`. While the specific *actions* a curator can take are limited in this example (`setGeneratorStatus`), this pattern allows for future integration of more complex governance or content curation features (e.g., voting on generator approvals, flagging NFTs).

8.  **Gas Efficiency & Security:**
    *   Uses `ReentrancyGuard` for functions that handle external calls involving value transfers (like buy, bid, settle, accept, withdraw).
    *   Uses `SafeERC20` for robust token interactions.
    *   Uses `safeTransferFrom` for ERC721 transfers.
    *   Native currency transfers use `.call` with a success check, which is safer than `.transfer` or `.send`.
    *   State mutations are performed *before* external calls where possible (e.g., deleting listings/auctions/offers before sending funds/NFTs).
    *   Error handling via `require` statements for various conditions (ownership, approval, amounts, timings, active status).

**Limitations and Potential Improvements for a Production System:**

*   **Staking Rewards:** The staking rewards mechanism is a very simplified placeholder. A real system would require a robust method for calculating and distributing rewards based on factors like duration, total staked, and a defined reward rate or revenue-sharing model.
*   **Royalty Enforcement:** While royalties are handled *within* this marketplace, it doesn't enforce royalties for sales happening *outside* this contract. ERC2981 integration would be needed for broader compatibility, but this adds complexity to the contract's interactions. The fallback royalty handling for failed payments is basic.
*   **Offer Management:** The `_tokenOffers` array is never cleaned up, potentially growing indefinitely with invalid offers. This is a gas optimization trade-off, as filtering happens on read/accept, but could become large for highly-offered tokens.
*   **Gas Limits:** Batch operations, especially `batchBuyItems`, could hit block gas limits if processing a very large number of items.
*   **Complex Generative Parameters:** The `bytes calldata generationParams` assumes the generator contract knows how to interpret these bytes. A more structured approach might use a library or a more specific interface.
*   **NFT Contract Address:** The contract relies on being able to determine the ERC721 contract address associated with a token ID, either by it being minted via a registered generator or potentially via an external lookup (not implemented here).
*   **Pause/Upgradeability:** Lacks common features like pausing the contract or upgradeability patterns (like UUPS/Transparent Proxies), which are common in complex DeFi/NFT platforms.
*   **Metadata:** Doesn't directly handle NFT metadata; this is assumed to be managed by the ERC721 contract minted by the generator.

This contract provides a solid foundation integrating multiple advanced concepts around generative NFTs and marketplace features, exceeding the function count requirement while aiming for creative non-duplication by combining these elements in a specific way.
