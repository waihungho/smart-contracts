/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation & Influence DAO (DRI-DAO)
 * @author Gemini (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
 *      focused on dynamic reputation and influence within its membership.
 *      This DAO incorporates advanced concepts like reputation tracking, influence-based voting,
 *      skill-based roles, dynamic NFT badges, and decentralized task management.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I. DAO Core Functions:**
 *   1. `initializeDAO(string _daoName, string _daoDescription, address _initialGovernor)`: Initializes the DAO with a name, description, and sets the initial governor.
 *   2. `proposeNewGovernor(address _newGovernor)`: Allows current governors to propose a new governor.
 *   3. `voteOnGovernorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on governor proposals based on their influence.
 *   4. `executeGovernorProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a governor proposal if it passes.
 *   5. `addDaoMember(address _newMember)`: Allows governors to add new members to the DAO.
 *   6. `removeDaoMember(address _memberToRemove)`: Allows governors to remove members from the DAO.
 *   7. `pauseDAO()`: Governor function to pause critical DAO operations in emergencies.
 *   8. `unpauseDAO()`: Governor function to resume paused DAO operations.
 *   9. `setVotingQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Governor function to change the voting quorum percentage.
 *   10. `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Governor function to change the voting duration in blocks.
 *
 * **II. Reputation & Influence System:**
 *   11. `recordContribution(address _member, string _contributionDescription, uint256 _reputationPoints)`: Governors can record positive contributions and award reputation points.
 *   12. `penalizeMember(address _member, string _reason, uint256 _reputationPoints)`: Governors can penalize members and deduct reputation points for negative actions.
 *   13. `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Returns the reputation points of a DAO member.
 *   14. `getMemberInfluence(address _member)`: Calculates and returns the influence of a member based on reputation and potentially other factors.
 *
 * **III. Skill-Based Roles & Task Management:**
 *   15. `assignRole(address _member, string _roleName)`: Governors can assign skill-based roles to members.
 *   16. `removeRole(address _member, string _roleName)`: Governors can remove roles from members.
 *   17. `getMemberRoles(address _member)`: Returns the roles assigned to a member.
 *   18. `createTask(string _taskDescription, string[] memory _requiredRoles, uint256 _reputationReward)`: Governors can create tasks requiring specific roles and offering reputation rewards.
 *   19. `applyForTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Members can apply for tasks they are qualified for (possessing required roles).
 *   20. `approveTaskApplication(uint256 _taskId, address _member)`: Governors can approve a member's application for a task.
 *   21. `completeTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Approved members can mark tasks as complete.
 *   22. `verifyTaskCompletion(uint256 _taskId)`: Governors verify task completion and award reputation points upon successful verification.
 *   23. `getTaskDetails(uint256 _taskId)`: Returns details of a specific task.
 *
 * **IV. Dynamic NFT Badge System (Conceptual - Requires NFT Contract Integration):**
 *   24. `mintBadgeNFT(address _member, string _badgeName, string _badgeMetadataURI)`:  (Conceptual - Requires external NFT contract) Governors can trigger minting of NFT badges for members based on achievements or roles.
 *   25. `revokeBadgeNFT(address _member, string _badgeName)`: (Conceptual - Requires external NFT contract) Governors can trigger revocation of NFT badges.
 *   26. `getMemberBadgeNFTs(address _member)`: (Conceptual - Requires external NFT contract and potentially indexer)  Function to query and return the NFT badges held by a member.
