/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Not Audited)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists, curators, and collectors to interact in a novel way.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Artist Management:**
 *   1. `registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistStatement)`: Allows artists to register with the collective.
 *   2. `updateArtistProfile(string _newArtistName, string _newArtistStatement)`: Artists can update their profile information.
 *   3. `verifyArtist(address _artistAddress)`: (Admin/Curator) Verifies an artist's registration, granting them full platform access.
 *   4. `revokeArtistVerification(address _artistAddress)`: (Admin/Curator) Revokes an artist's verification.
 *   5. `getArtistProfile(address _artistAddress)`: Retrieves an artist's profile information.
 *
 * **Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *   6. `submitArtwork(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash)`: Artists submit their artwork for curation.
 *   7. `startCurationRound()`: (Curator) Initiates a new curation round.
 *   8. `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Curators vote on submitted artworks.
 *   9. `endCurationRound()`: (Curator) Ends the current curation round, processing votes and updating artwork statuses.
 *   10. `getArtworkCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves the curation status of a specific artwork.
 *   11. `getCurationRoundStatus()`: Gets the current status of the active curation round (if any).
 *
 * **NFT Minting & Marketplace:**
 *   12. `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an NFT for a curated and approved artwork.
 *   13. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _nftTokenId, uint256 _price)`: Artists list their minted NFTs for sale on the platform marketplace.
 *   14. `purchaseArtworkNFT(uint256 _nftTokenId)`: Collectors purchase listed NFTs.
 *   15. `delistArtworkFromSale(uint256 _nftTokenId)`: Artists can delist their NFTs from sale.
 *   16. `getArtworkListingDetails(uint256 _nftTokenId)`: Retrieves listing details for an NFT.
 *
 * **Collective Governance & Treasury:**
 *   17. `depositToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective's treasury.
 *   18. `proposePlatformFeeChange(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: (Verified Artist/Curator) Proposes a change to the platform fee.
 *   19. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Verified Artists and Curators vote on governance proposals.
 *   20. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Admin) Executes an approved governance proposal.
 *   21. `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the status of a governance proposal.
 *   22. `withdrawTreasuryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: (Admin - with multi-sig or DAO in real app) Allows withdrawal of funds from the treasury.
 *
 * **Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *   23. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: (Admin) Sets the platform fee percentage for NFT sales.
 *   24. `pauseContract()`: (Admin) Pauses core contract functionalities (emergency).
 *   25. `unpauseContract()`: (Admin) Resumes contract functionalities.
 *   26. `getPlatformFee()`: Retrieves the current platform fee percentage.

**Explanation of Concepts and Novelty:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Theme:** The contract is designed around the concept of a DAAC, which is a trendy and evolving area in the crypto space. It aims to create a community-driven art platform.

2.  **Artist Verification & Profiles:**  Includes a registration and verification process for artists. This adds a layer of curation and quality control, distinguishing it from purely permissionless systems. Artist profiles store name and statements, enhancing community interaction.

3.  **Curation Rounds & Voting:** Implements a structured curation process with rounds and voting by curators (initially admins in this example). This is more advanced than simple submission-based NFT marketplaces and adds a layer of decentralized quality assessment.

4.  **NFT Marketplace Integration (Simplified):** While it doesn't implement a full ERC721 NFT contract within itself (to avoid duplication and keep focus), it includes functions to *simulate* NFT minting and a basic marketplace for these "NFTs" listed within the contract. In a real-world scenario, this would interact with an external NFT contract.

5.  **Governance Proposals & Voting:**  Features basic governance by allowing verified artists and curators to propose and vote on changes, such as the platform fee. This starts to incorporate DAO principles into the art collective.

6.  **Treasury Management:** Includes a simple treasury where platform fees and direct deposits can accumulate.  Admin control over withdrawals is included for demonstration, but in a true DAO, this would be managed by multi-sig or further decentralized governance.

7.  **Platform Fee Mechanism:**  Introduces a platform fee on NFT sales, which is a common mechanism in marketplaces but integrated here within the DAAC context. The fee is deposited into the treasury.

8.  **Pause Functionality:** Includes pause/unpause functions for emergency situations, a common security practice in smart contracts.

9.  **Event Emission:**  Comprehensive use of events for tracking key actions, making the contract auditable and integrable with front-end applications.

10. **Modifiers for Access Control:**  Uses modifiers extensively (`onlyAdmin`, `onlyVerifiedArtists`, `onlyCurators`, `whenNotPaused`, etc.) for robust access control and state management, making the contract more secure and readable.

**Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

*   **Community Curation:** Decentralized curation is a key advanced concept. It attempts to shift the power of art selection away from centralized authorities to a community of curators.
*   **DAO Elements in Art:**  Integrating governance mechanisms into an art platform is a creative application of DAO principles beyond typical financial or voting DAOs.
*   **Platform Fee as Treasury:**  Using platform fees to fund a collective treasury is a sustainable model for decentralized platforms.
*   **Simplified NFT & Marketplace:** The internal handling of NFTs and the marketplace is simplified for demonstration within a single contract. In a real-world application, this would be more complex and involve external NFT contracts and potentially more sophisticated marketplace mechanics.
*   **Proposal-Based Governance:**  The governance system uses proposals and voting, a fundamental concept in DAOs, applied to platform parameters like fees.

**Trendiness:**

*   **DAOs:** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are a major trend in blockchain.
*   **NFTs:** Non-Fungible Tokens are still a very relevant and evolving trend in art and collectibles.
*   **Community-Driven Platforms:**  The desire for decentralized, community-governed platforms is a growing trend, moving away from centralized control.
*   **Creator Economy:**  This contract supports the creator economy by enabling artists to directly monetize their work and participate in the platform's governance.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security Audit:** This contract is provided as an example and has not been audited for security vulnerabilities. **Do not deploy to a production environment without a thorough security audit.**
*   **Simplifications:**  Many aspects are simplified for clarity and demonstration within a single contract:
    *   NFT minting is simulated. A real implementation would use ERC721 or similar.
    *   Curator roles are simplified (admins are curators). A real system would have a more robust curator management system.
    *   Governance is basic. A more advanced DAO would have more sophisticated voting mechanisms, quorum rules, and proposal types.
    *   Marketplace is basic. A real marketplace would have more features like auctions, offers, etc.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract is written for functionality and clarity, not necessarily for gas optimization. In a production environment, gas optimization would be important.
*   **Scalability:**  This contract is a single contract and might face scalability limitations as the collective grows. For a large-scale DAAC, a more modular and potentially Layer-2 solution might be needed.

This contract provides a foundation and a range of functions that are more advanced and creative than basic token contracts, while touching upon current trends in the blockchain space. Remember that it's a starting point and would require significant development and security review for real-world deployment.
