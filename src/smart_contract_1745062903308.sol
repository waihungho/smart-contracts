 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It allows artists to submit artwork, community members to curate and vote on submissions,
 * mint NFTs for accepted artwork, manage a treasury, and implement dynamic artist royalties
 * based on community engagement and reputation.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Membership Management:**
 *    - Join/Leave Collective (Membership NFT)
 *    - Get Member Details
 *    - Check Membership Status
 *
 * 2. **Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *    - Submit Artwork (with Metadata URI)
 *    - Get Artwork Details
 *    - Start Curation Vote
 *    - Vote on Artwork Curation
 *    - Get Curation Vote Result
 *    - Execute Curation (Mint NFT if accepted)
 *
 * 3. **Dynamic Royalty System:**
 *    - Set Base Royalty Percentage
 *    - Adjust Artist Royalty (based on community score/reputation - conceptual)
 *    - Get Artist Royalty Percentage
 *
 * 4. **Treasury Management:**
 *    - Deposit Funds to Treasury
 *    - Withdraw Funds from Treasury (Governance Required)
 *    - Get Treasury Balance
 *
 * 5. **Governance & Proposals (Simplified):**
 *    - Create Proposal (General Purpose)
 *    - Vote on Proposal
 *    - Execute Proposal (Simplified - owner can execute after passing)
 *    - Get Proposal Details
 *
 * 6. **Community Engagement & Reputation (Conceptual):**
 *    - Artist Reputation Points (conceptual - could be based on curation success, community votes, etc.)
 *    - Get Artist Reputation
 *    - Reward Active Members (conceptual - could be based on voting participation, proposals, etc.)
 *
 * 7. **NFT Functionality:**
 *    - Get NFT Contract Address
 *    - Get NFT Token URI
 *    - Get NFT Owner
 *
 * 8. **Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *    - Set Curation Vote Duration
 *    - Set Proposal Vote Duration
 *    - Pause/Unpause Contract
 *    - Owner Functions (management)
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * 1. `joinCollective()`: Allows users to join the art collective by minting a Membership NFT.
 * 2. `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective and burn their Membership NFT.
 * 3. `getMemberDetails(address _member)`: Returns details of a member (e.g., join timestamp).
 * 4. `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 * 5. `submitArtwork(string memory _artworkURI)`: Allows members to submit artwork with metadata URI.
 * 6. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns details of a submitted artwork.
 * 7. `startCurationVote(uint256 _artworkId)`: Starts a curation vote for a submitted artwork (owner/curator role).
 * 8. `voteOnCuration(uint256 _artworkId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on artwork curation.
 * 9. `getCurationVoteResult(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the result of a curation vote.
 * 10. `executeCuration(uint256 _artworkId)`: Executes the curation result, minting NFT if accepted.
 * 11. `setBaseRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _percentage)`: Sets the base royalty percentage for NFT sales (owner function).
 * 12. `adjustArtistRoyalty(address _artist, uint256 _newPercentage)`:  (Conceptual) Adjusts an artist's royalty percentage (governance/reputation-based).
 * 13. `getArtistRoyaltyPercentage(address _artist)`: Returns the royalty percentage for a given artist.
 * 14. `depositToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit funds into the collective's treasury.
 * 15. `withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: Allows withdrawal from the treasury (governance required - simplified owner for example).
 * 16. `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the treasury.
 * 17. `createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Allows members to create general proposals.
 * 18. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on proposals.
 * 19. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal (simplified - owner executes).
 * 20. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details of a proposal.
 * 21. `getArtistReputation(address _artist)`: (Conceptual) Returns the reputation score of an artist.
 * 22. `getNFTContractAddress()`: Returns the address of the deployed Artwork NFT contract.
 * 23. `getNFTTokenURI(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the token URI for a minted artwork NFT.
 * 24. `getNFTOwner(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the owner of a specific artwork NFT.
 * 25. `setCurationVoteDuration(uint256 _durationSeconds)`: Sets the duration for curation votes (owner function).
 * 26. `setProposalVoteDuration(uint256 _durationSeconds)`: Sets the duration for general proposals (owner function).
 * 27. `pauseContract()`: Pauses the contract, restricting certain functionalities (owner function).
 * 28. `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract, restoring functionalities (owner function).
 * 29. `ownerWithdrawTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Owner-only function to withdraw treasury funds (for emergency/initial setup).

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The core concept is to create a DAO focused on art. This is trendy as DAOs and NFTs are both hot topics.
2.  **Membership NFTs:**  Joining the collective is done by minting a Membership NFT. This is a modern approach to access control and community building in web3.
3.  **Artwork Curation via Voting:**  Members vote on submitted artwork. This is a decentralized curation process, leveraging the community's taste.
4.  **Dynamic Royalties (Conceptual):** The royalty system is designed to be dynamic. While the `adjustArtistRoyalty` function is owner-controlled for simplicity in this example, in a real advanced DAO, this could be governed by community proposals and potentially tied to an artist's reputation within the collective. This adds a layer of gamification and rewards engaged artists.
5.  **Governance Proposals (Simplified):**  A basic proposal system allows members to propose changes or actions for the collective.  In a real DAO, this would be much more robust with quorum, different voting types, and on-chain execution of proposals. Here, execution is simplified to owner-driven after a vote passes, for demonstration purposes.
6.  **Treasury Management:** The contract includes a simple treasury where funds can be deposited and (in this simplified version) withdrawn by the owner (in a real DAO, withdrawals would be governed by proposals).
7.  **Conceptual Reputation System:** The `artistReputation` mapping and `getArtistReputation` function are placeholders for a more advanced reputation system. This could track artist contributions, successful curations, community votes, etc., and potentially influence royalty rates or other benefits.
8.  **Artwork NFTs:** When artwork passes curation, it's minted as an NFT.  This is the core value generation for the collective.
9.  **Pausable Contract:** Includes `Pausable` functionality for emergency situations, a good security practice.
10. **OpenZeppelin Libraries:**  Utilizes OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC721, Ownable, Counters, Pausable, and Strings, promoting secure and standard development practices.

**How it's Creative and Trendy:**

*   **Combines DAOs and NFTs:**  Integrates two major blockchain trends into a cohesive concept.
*   **Community-Driven Curation:**  Decentralizes the art curation process, empowering the community.
*   **Dynamic Royalty System:**  Moves beyond static royalties, introducing a more engaging and potentially fairer model.
*   **Focus on Art:**  Specifically targets the art world, which is a growing area for NFTs and blockchain innovation.
*   **Membership-Based Collective:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and community ownership.

**Advanced Concepts Used:**

*   **DAO Principles:**  Implements basic DAO governance mechanisms (membership, voting, proposals).
*   **NFT Integration:**  Uses NFTs for membership and artwork ownership.
*   **Access Control:**  Uses `onlyMember` and `onlyOwner` modifiers for access control.
*   **Event Emission:**  Emits events for important actions, allowing for off-chain monitoring and integration.
*   **Structs and Mappings:**  Uses structs and mappings for efficient data management.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified Governance:** The governance and proposal system is simplified for demonstration. A real-world DAO would require a more robust and secure governance framework (e.g., using voting contracts, timelocks, delegatecall for proposal execution, etc.).
*   **Conceptual Reputation:** The reputation system is just a placeholder and would need to be fully designed and implemented based on specific criteria.
*   **Gas Optimization:** This contract is written for clarity and concept demonstration. Gas optimization would be crucial for a production-ready contract.
*   **Security Audit:**  Any smart contract dealing with assets should be thoroughly audited by security professionals before deployment.
*   **Artwork NFT Contract:** In this example, the `DecentralizedArtCollective` contract also acts as the Artwork NFT contract for simplicity (`artworkNFTContractAddress = address(this)`). In a more complex system, you might have a separate dedicated ERC721 contract for the artwork NFTs.
*   **Error Handling and Security:**  The contract includes basic `require` statements for error handling. More comprehensive error handling, input validation, and security considerations would be needed for a production deployment.
*   **Calldata in Proposals:** The `calldata` in proposals is a very simplified example.  In a real system, you'd need a more robust way to define and execute on-chain actions based on proposals, often involving function signatures and encoded parameters.

This contract provides a solid foundation and many interesting features that go beyond basic smart contracts while incorporating trendy concepts. You can expand upon these features to build a more sophisticated and feature-rich Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective.
