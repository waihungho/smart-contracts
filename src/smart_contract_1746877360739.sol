Okay, here is a smart contract written in Solidity that attempts to incorporate several advanced, creative, and non-standard concepts centered around a "Quantum Fluctuating Vault". It manages multiple ERC20 tokens and applies dynamic effects (like fees, bonuses, or simulated yield boosts) based on a periodically changing "Fluctuation State" derived from pseudo-randomness. It also includes a basic prediction market mechanism around this state.

**Disclaimer:** The pseudo-randomness source (`block.timestamp ^ block.difficulty`) used in this contract is **NOT cryptographically secure** and should never be used for high-value applications where unpredictable outcomes are critical. A truly secure implementation would require an external source like Chainlink VRF or a VDF. The yield strategies are also *simulated* within the contract for demonstration purposes; a real vault would interact with external DeFi protocols. This contract is for educational and illustrative purposes showcasing concepts.

/**
 * @title QuantumFluctuatingVault
 * @dev A creative ERC20 vault contract that uses a dynamic "Quantum Fluctuation State"
 *      derived from pseudo-randomness to influence deposit/withdrawal mechanics,
 *      yield distribution, and potentially strategy weighting. Includes a prediction market
 *      feature for the next state.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Variables: Stores vault state, user balances, fluctuation parameters, history, prediction data.
 * 2. Events: Logs key actions like deposits, withdrawals, fluctuations, predictions.
 * 3. Modifiers: Custom checks (e.g., asset supported, not paused).
 * 4. Constructor: Initializes vault owner and base parameters.
 * 5. Core Vault Functions: Deposit, Withdraw with fluctuating effects.
 * 6. Fluctuation Management: Triggering new states, reading state/history.
 * 7. Asset Management: Owner functions to add/remove supported tokens.
 * 8. Parameter Configuration: Owner functions to tune fluctuation effects and intervals.
 * 9. Yield Simulation/Distribution: Owner-triggered yield addition and user claiming based on shares.
 * 10. Prediction Market: Users predict next fluctuation state, owner reveals, users claim rewards.
 * 11. Utility/View Functions: Get vault/user data, estimate effects.
 * 12. Emergency/Admin: Pause, sweeping tokens.

/**
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * Constructor:
 * - `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, sets owner and initial fluctuation parameters.
 *
 * Core Vault Functions:
 * - `deposit(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit supported tokens. Applies dynamic bonus/penalty based on current fluctuation state affecting shares received.
 * - `withdraw(address token, uint256 shares)`: Allows users to withdraw their share of tokens. Applies dynamic fee based on current fluctuation state.
 * - `getTotalPooledAmount(address token)`: View total balance of a supported token held by the vault.
 * - `getUserShares(address user, address token)`: View the number of shares a user holds for a specific token.
 * - `getSharesValue(address token, uint256 shares)`: View the estimated token value corresponding to a given number of shares for a specific token.
 *
 * Fluctuation Management:
 * - `triggerQuantumFluctuation()`: Callable by anyone after the interval expires. Generates new pseudo-random seed, determines next fluctuation state and parameters, and updates the current state.
 * - `getCurrentFluctuationState()`: View the ID, state type, seed, and timestamp of the current fluctuation period.
 * - `getFluctuationEffectParameters()`: View the specific multipliers/percentages currently applied by the fluctuation state (deposit bonus/penalty, withdrawal fee, yield boost).
 * - `getFluctuationHistory(uint256 limit)`: View details of recent past fluctuation states up to a specified limit.
 * - `getFluctuationSeedUsed(uint256 fluctuationId)`: View the pseudo-random seed used for a specific past fluctuation ID.
 *
 * Asset Management (Owner Only):
 * - `addSupportedAsset(address token)`: Adds an ERC20 token to the list of supported assets for deposit/withdrawal.
 * - `removeSupportedAsset(address token)`: Removes an ERC20 token from the supported list.
 * - `getSupportedAssets()`: View the list of addresses of supported tokens.
 *
 * Parameter Configuration (Owner Only):
 * - `setFluctuationTriggerInterval(uint256 blockInterval)`: Sets the minimum number of blocks between triggering fluctuations.
 * - `setFluctuationParameterMultipliers(uint256 depositEffectBasisPoints, uint256 withdrawalFeeBasisPoints, uint256 yieldBoostBasisPoints)`: Sets the base multiplier effects for each fluctuation state type (applied on top of state-specific values).
 * - `setPredictionParameters(uint256 predictionFee, uint256 rewardPercentage)`: Sets the fee required to make a prediction and the percentage of the prediction pool allocated as reward.
 *
 * Yield Simulation/Distribution:
 * - `simulateYieldDistribution(address token, uint256 amount)`: Owner-triggered function to simulate external yield being added to the vault for a specific token. Increases the vault balance without minting new shares, increasing the value per share over time.
 * - `claimAccruedYield(address token)`: Allows a user to claim their portion of the *accrued* yield for a specific token by adjusting their shares to reflect only their original deposit value and transferring the excess token amount. (Note: This is a simplified yield claiming model).
 * - `getUserAccruedYieldEstimate(address user, address token)`: Estimates the amount of yield a user could claim for a token based on their current shares and the current value per share.
 *
 * Prediction Market:
 * - `predictNextFluctuationState(uint256 predictedState)`: Allows a user to pay a fee and predict the state type of the *next* fluctuation.
 * - `revealFluctuationState(uint256 fluctuationId)`: Owner-triggered function to make the state of a *past* fluctuation ID publicly available for prediction claiming. Called after `triggerQuantumFluctuation` creates a new state, revealing the *previous* one.
 * - `claimPredictionReward(uint256 fluctuationId)`: Allows a user who correctly predicted the state of a specific `fluctuationId` to claim a reward from the prediction pool.
 * - `getUserPrediction(address user, uint256 fluctuationId)`: View a user's prediction for a specific fluctuation ID.
 *
 * Utility/View Functions:
 * - `estimateWithdrawalCost(address token, uint256 shares)`: Estimates the potential fee applied during withdrawal for a given number of shares.
 * - `estimateDepositGainLoss(address token, uint256 amount)`: Estimates the potential shares bonus/penalty applied during deposit for a given amount.
 * - `isSupportedAsset(address token)`: Checks if a token is currently supported.
 * - `paused()`: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
 *
 * Emergency/Admin (Owner Only):
 * - `pauseContract(bool state)`: Pauses/unpauses deposits and withdrawals.
 * - `sweepUnsupportedTokens(address token, address recipient)`: Allows owner to sweep tokens sent to the contract that are not supported or part of the vault's core function.

        // User yield is proportional to their share of *total shares*.
        // This requires tracking total accumulated yield per token, or distributing a pool.
        // This simple vault structure makes tracking yield per user difficult without a complex system.

        // REVISED SIMPLE YIELD CLAIM:
        // Assume yield *increases* the total balance only.
        // The `getSharesValue` function already tells us the current value of a user's shares.
        // If user wants to claim yield, they withdraw an amount but keep their shares,
        // OR burn shares equivalent to the yield value.
        // Burning shares is cleaner.
        // Calculate how many tokens their shares are currently worth (`userCurrentValue`).
        // Calculate how many tokens their shares were "originally" worth if 1 share == 1 token at their deposit time.
        // This original value is hard to track per share batch.

        // Let's use a very basic model: User burns X shares and receives the current value of those shares.
        // To "claim yield" specifically, they'd need a separate yield-bearing share or token.
        // This simple vault only has one type of share per token.

        // ALTERNATIVE SIMPLIFIED YIELD CLAIM:
        // Owner adds yield via `simulateYieldDistribution`. This increases totalBalance.
        // `getSharesValue` now returns a higher value per share.
        // Users can simply withdraw *more* tokens than their original deposit value by withdrawing their shares.
        // The "claimYield" function can be redefined to allow withdrawing the *excess* value of their shares,
        // burning *some* shares corresponding to the *original* deposit value, and transferring the excess.
        // This requires tracking original deposit value per user somehow.

        // Let's make `claimAccruedYield` burn shares equivalent to the *value increase* above the initial 1:1 ratio.
        // This requires knowing the *initial* shares-to-token ratio for the user's deposits.
        // Too complex for a simple example.

        // Let's simplify even more: `simulateYieldDistribution` adds yield *to* the vault.
        // Users claim yield by simply calling `withdraw` on their shares.
        // The *increased value per share* due to simulated yield means they get more tokens than they put in.
        // The `claimAccruedYield` function will instead be a view function to *estimate* claimable yield,
        // and the actual claiming happens via `withdraw`.

        // Let's reinstate `claimAccruedYield` as a function that allows claiming a calculated yield amount
        // by burning shares proportional to the claimed yield's value, while keeping principal shares.
        // This is non-standard. Let's make it simpler: User burns *all* shares to get principal + yield.
        // The `withdraw` function already does this.

        // Okay, final approach for `claimAccruedYield`: It calculates the value increase of the user's shares
        // since their last claim (or deposit). It transfers this *yield amount* to the user
        // and *does not burn shares*. This is an unusual model but fits the "claim yield separately" idea.
        // This requires tracking a "last claimed value" or similar per user/token.
        // Still complex state.

        // Let's revert to the standard vault model where yield just increases value per share,
        // and users claim yield by withdrawing shares.
        // The `simulateYieldDistribution` adds to the pool.
        // `claimAccruedYield` function name is misleading in this standard model.
        // Let's make `claimAccruedYield` simply a function that allows a user to withdraw *a calculated yield amount*
        // based on the *total* yield added since the user deposited, pro-rata their shares.
        // This requires tracking total yield per token added via `simulateYieldDistribution`.

        // Total "original" tokens deposited per token across all users: Sum of amount * (10000/depositEffectBps) at time of deposit.
        // Total current tokens: balance.
        // Total Yield = totalTokens - totalOriginalTokens.
        // User Yield = userShares / totalShares * Total Yield.

        // This still requires tracking total original token equivalent value. Let's simplify state variables.

        // SIMPLIFIED FINAL YIELD MODEL for this example:
        // `simulateYieldDistribution(token, amount)`: Increases total token balance (conceptual).
        // `claimAccruedYield(token)`: Calculates the user's current share value (`userCurrentValue`).
        // It needs a reference point. Let's assume the reference is 1 share = 1 token *at the time of the *first* deposit*.
        // This is only true if `_totalShares == 0`.
        // A better reference is the token amount that was *originally* received for those shares.
        // This requires storing how many tokens each *batch* of shares represents. Too much state.

        // Let's abandon a precise, separate "yield claim" function in this simple contract structure.
        // The `simulateYieldDistribution` function increases value per share.
        // Users withdraw this increased value via the standard `withdraw` function.
