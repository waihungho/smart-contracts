Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Guild (DAG) with a focus on advanced concepts like internal reputation/XP, modular functionality, and flexible governance for executing various on-chain actions. It goes beyond typical DAO examples by incorporating member roles, XP, and a system for trusted external modules to interact with the guild's core state.

---

**Outline and Function Summary**

This smart contract, `DecentralizedAutonomousGuild`, establishes a self-governing decentralized guild.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Membership:** Members have roles (e.g., Initiate, Member, Elder) and reputation (XP). Invitation-based joining.
2.  **Treasury:** Holds ERC20 tokens, managed entirely by governance.
3.  **Governance:** Proposal-based system where members stake Guild Tokens to propose, vote based on delegated or self-staked power, and execute approved actions. Supports diverse proposal types via generic `target.call`.
4.  **Reputation (XP):** An internal non-transferable metric tracking member contribution, potentially affecting voting power or roles (though direct linkage is left to governance/modules). XP is granted via governance actions or trusted modules.
5.  **Modules:** Approved external contracts can be registered and granted specific permissions to call back into the DAG contract to perform restricted actions (e.g., grant XP based on off-chain activity or complex game logic). This allows extending DAG functionality without upgrading the core contract.
6.  **Pausability:** Standard emergency pause mechanism.

**Key Functions (categorized for clarity):**

*   **Initialization & Core:**
    *   `constructor`: Deploys the contract, sets initial owner.
    *   `setGuildToken`: Sets the address of the main ERC20 token used for staking/governance.
    *   `pause`: Pauses contract functionality (owner only).
    *   `unpause`: Unpauses contract functionality (owner only).

*   **Membership Management:**
    *   `inviteMember`: Elder/Governor role initiates an invitation.
    *   `acceptInvitation`: Invited address accepts.
    *   `removeMember`: Governance proposal execution to remove a member.
    *   `updateMemberRole`: Governance proposal execution to change a member's role.
    *   `delegateVotingPower`: Member delegates voting power to another address.
    *   `undelegateVotingPower`: Member recalls delegated voting power.

*   **Treasury Management:**
    *   `depositTreasury`: Allows anyone to deposit allowed ERC20 tokens.
    *   `withdrawTreasury`: Governance proposal execution to withdraw tokens.
    *   `registerTreasuryToken`: Governance proposal execution to allow holding a new ERC20 token.

*   **Governance (Proposals & Voting):**
    *   `createProposal`: Member with sufficient stake creates a new proposal. Requires staking Guild Tokens.
    *   `voteOnProposal`: Member casts a vote (For/Against). Requires voting power.
    *   `executeProposal`: Executes a proposal that has met quorum and threshold requirements and is within the execution period.
    *   `cancelProposal`: Proposer or governance can cancel an active or queued proposal under specific conditions.
    *   `setVotingPeriod`: Governance proposal execution to set the duration of voting periods.
    *   `setQuorum`: Governance proposal execution to set the minimum percentage of total voting power required to vote on a proposal.
    *   `setVotingThreshold`: Governance proposal execution to set the minimum percentage of votes needed for approval (relative to votes cast).

*   **Reputation (XP):**
    *   `moduleGrantXP`: Restricted function callable *only* by registered modules or specific governance executions to grant XP to a member. (Internal helper `_grantXP` is the actual logic, this is the external entry point for modules).

*   **Module Management & Interaction:**
    *   `registerModule`: Governance proposal execution to register a trusted external module contract.
    *   `unregisterModule`: Governance proposal execution to unregister a module.
    *   `moduleInitiateProposal`: Restricted function callable *only* by registered modules to create a proposal draft that still requires normal member voting.
    *   `delegateGuildAction`: Restricted function callable *only* by registered modules to request the DAG to perform a specific, pre-approved internal action (like `_grantXP` via internal dispatch).

*   **View Functions (Public Getters):**
    *   `isMember`: Checks if an address is a current member.
    *   `getMemberInfo`: Retrieves a member's role, XP, and invitation status.
    *   `getGuildToken`: Gets the address of the main Guild Token.
    *   `getRegisteredTreasuryTokens`: Lists all ERC20 tokens the treasury is allowed to hold.
    *   `getRegisteredModules`: Lists addresses of all registered module contracts.
    *   `getProposalState`: Gets the current state of a proposal.
    *   `getProposalInfo`: Retrieves detailed information about a proposal.
    *   `getProposalCount`: Total number of proposals created.
    *   `getVotingPower`: Gets an address's current effective voting power.
    *   `getTreasuryBalance`: Gets the balance of a specific token held by the treasury.

**Total Public/External Functions: 30+**

        // No, the description says "percentage of total voting power". This necessitates a way to get total voting power.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Generic Proposal Execution (`target.call`)**: The `executeProposal` function is highly flexible. It doesn't just handle predefined actions (like treasury transfers or role changes). It can call *any* arbitrary function on *any* contract address (`target`) with *any* data (`callData`), including sending native tokens (`value`). This allows the DAO to interact with DeFi protocols, other DAOs, upgradeable contract proxies, or trigger complex logic in external contracts *if* approved by governance. This power requires a highly trusted and active governance body.
2.  **Internal Reputation (XP)**: The `xp` system provides a non-monetary reward mechanism within the guild. While this contract doesn't *automatically* tie XP to voting power or roles, it provides the state foundation. Governance proposals (`updateMemberRole`) or registered modules (`moduleGrantXP`) can leverage XP, creating complex, game-like progression or reputation systems based on contributions verified on or off-chain.
3.  **Modular Functionality (`s_registeredModules`, `moduleGrantXP`, `moduleInitiateProposal`, `delegateGuildAction`)**: This is a key advanced pattern. The core DAG contract remains relatively stable, handling membership, treasury, and governance. New features (like complex task management, mini-games, specific DeFi strategies, oracles interactions) can be implemented in separate "module" contracts. These modules, once registered via governance, gain restricted permissions to call *back* into the DAG contract to trigger specific, whitelisted actions (`delegateGuildAction` dispatching to internal helpers like `_grantXP`). This design enhances upgradability and separation of concerns without requiring a full proxy pattern for the core DAG. `moduleInitiateProposal` allows modules to request complex actions that still need human member approval via the standard governance process.
4.  **Delegatee-Based Voting Power**: While using `IERC20(guildToken).balanceOf(effectiveDelegatee)` for voting power is a standard pattern derived from tokens like those in Compound or Uniswap, implementing the delegation chain *within* the DAG contract's member struct shows how this can be managed directly for a simple ERC20, rather than relying on a token standard like ERC20Votes. (Note the gas limitation mentioned in `_getTotalVotingPower`).
5.  **Explicit Governance Targets**: Functions like `removeMember`, `updateMemberRole`, `withdrawTreasury`, `registerTreasuryToken`, `setVotingPeriod`, `setQuorum`, `setVotingThreshold`, `registerModule`, `unregisterModule` are not callable directly by members. They are explicitly designed as *targets* for successful governance proposals, ensuring all significant state changes go through the DAO process.

This contract structure provides a solid foundation for a dynamic, extensible decentralized organization with integrated reputation and flexible governance capabilities. Remember that deploying and managing such a contract involves significant responsibility, especially regarding the power of `executeProposal` and the security of registered modules.
