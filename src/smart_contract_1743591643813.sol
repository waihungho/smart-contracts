 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Conceptual Contract)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * This contract facilitates collaborative art creation, curation, fractional ownership,
 * and decentralized governance within an art collective. It incorporates advanced concepts
 * like reputation-based voting, dynamic royalties, collaborative NFT minting, and
 * delegated curation.

 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1. `joinCollective(string _artistName, string _artistStatement)`: Allows artists to join the collective by staking governance tokens and providing artist information.
 * 2. `leaveCollective()`: Allows artists to leave the collective, unstaking their governance tokens.
 * 3. `submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Artists propose new art pieces (represented by IPFS hash) for collective consideration.
 * 4. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Collective members vote on art proposals based on their reputation.
 * 5. `executeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved art proposal, minting a collaborative NFT and adding it to the collective's gallery.
 * 6. `mintCollaborativeNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints a collaborative NFT for an approved art proposal, with fractional ownership distributed to contributors and the collective.
 * 7. `setArtPrice(uint256 _artId, uint256 _price)`: Allows the collective to set the price for an art piece in the gallery.
 * 8. `buyArt(uint256 _artId)`: Allows users to purchase art pieces from the collective's gallery, distributing revenue according to royalty rules.
 * 9. `fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Allows the collective to fractionalize ownership of an art piece into ERC1155 tokens for wider distribution and trading.
 * 10. `redeemFraction(uint256 _fractionalArtId, uint256 _fractionId)`: Allows fractional owners to redeem their fractions, potentially triggering a collective decision on the art piece's future.

 * **Governance and Management:**
 * 11. `proposeRuleChange(string _ruleDescription, bytes _newRuleData)`: Allows members to propose changes to collective rules and parameters.
 * 12. `voteOnRuleChange(uint256 _ruleProposalId, bool _vote)`: Collective members vote on proposed rule changes.
 * 13. `executeRuleChange(uint256 _ruleProposalId)`: Executes an approved rule change, updating contract parameters.
 * 14. `delegateCurationPower(address _delegateAddress)`: Allows members to delegate their art proposal voting power to another member (reputation-based delegation).
 * 15. `withdrawCollectiveFunds()`: Allows authorized members to withdraw funds accumulated by the collective (governance controlled).
 * 16. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows governance to set the platform fee charged on art sales.
 * 17. `pauseContract()`: Allows governance to pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 * 18. `unpauseContract()`: Allows governance to resume contract functions after a pause.

 * **Reputation and Community:**
 * 19. `contributeToCollective(string _contributionDescription)`: Allows members to record contributions to the collective, potentially impacting reputation.
 * 20. `rewardContributor(address _contributorAddress, uint256 _rewardPoints)`: Allows governance to reward active contributors with reputation points, influencing voting power.
 * 21. `getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: Returns the reputation score of an artist within the collective.
 * 22. `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: Returns details of a specific art piece in the gallery.
 * 23. `getMemberDetails(address _memberAddress)`: Returns details of a collective member.
 * 24. `getTotalArtPieces()`: Returns the total number of art pieces in the collective's gallery.

 * **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 * - **Reputation-based Voting:** Voting power is influenced by member reputation, promoting informed and engaged governance.
 * - **Dynamic Royalties (Conceptual):** Revenue distribution can be dynamically adjusted through governance proposals.
 * - **Collaborative NFT Minting:** NFTs are minted collaboratively, recognizing contributions of multiple artists and the collective itself.
 * - **Delegated Curation:** Members can delegate their curation power, allowing for specialized expertise in art selection.
 * - **Fractional Ownership & Redemption:** Art can be fractionalized for wider access, with a redemption mechanism for collective decision-making on valuable pieces.
 * - **Dynamic Governance:** Rules and parameters are adjustable through on-chain governance proposals and voting.
