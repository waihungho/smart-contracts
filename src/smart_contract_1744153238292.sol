 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like dynamic NFT royalties,
 *      curated exhibitions governed by DAO voting, artist reputation system, layered NFT interactions, and decentralized storage integration.
 *      This contract aims to provide a comprehensive platform for artists and collectors in a decentralized and autonomous manner.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Artist Management:**
 * 1. `registerArtist(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio, string memory _artistWebsite)`: Allows artists to register themselves on the platform, providing name, bio, and website.
 * 2. `updateArtistProfile(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio, string memory _artistWebsite)`: Allows registered artists to update their profile information.
 * 3. `getArtistProfile(address _artistAddress) public view returns (string memory artistName, string memory artistBio, string memory artistWebsite, uint256 reputationScore)`: Retrieves an artist's profile details and reputation score.
 *
 * **Artwork (NFT) Management:**
 * 4. `mintArtwork(string memory _artworkTitle, string memory _artworkDescription, string memory _artworkIPFSHash, uint256 _initialPrice, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Allows registered artists to mint new artworks (NFTs) with title, description, IPFS hash, initial price, and royalty percentage.
 * 5. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows the artist to update the price of their artwork.
 * 6. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)` payable: Allows users to purchase an artwork, transferring ownership and paying the artist and royalties.
 * 7. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the artwork owner to list their artwork for sale in the gallery.
 * 8. `removeArtworkFromSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the artwork owner to remove their artwork from sale.
 * 9. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId) public view returns (address artist, string memory artworkTitle, string memory artworkDescription, string memory artworkIPFSHash, uint256 price, uint256 royaltyPercentage, bool isListed)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 10. `burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the original artist to burn their artwork (NFT) under specific conditions (e.g., copyright issues, artist decision - governed by DAO in future iterations).
 *
 * **Exhibition and Curation:**
 * 11. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionTitle, string memory _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows curators (DAO-governed roles in future) to create new exhibitions with title, description, start and end times.
 * 12. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to add artworks to a specific exhibition.
 * 13. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to remove artworks from an exhibition.
 * 14. `getActiveExhibitions() public view returns (uint256[] memory)`: Retrieves a list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 * 15. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId) public view returns (string memory exhibitionTitle, string memory exhibitionDescription, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, uint256[] memory artworkIds)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition, including its artworks.
 *
 * **Reputation and Rewards (Basic - can be expanded):**
 * 16. `increaseArtistReputation(address _artistAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Function to increase an artist's reputation score (initially admin/DAO controlled, can be automated).
 * 17. `decreaseArtistReputation(address _artistAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Function to decrease an artist's reputation score (initially admin/DAO controlled, can be automated).
 *
 * **Platform Utility and Governance (Basic - DAO integration in future iterations):**
 * 18. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Allows platform admin (DAO in future) to set the platform fee percentage for artwork sales.
 * 19. `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows platform admin (DAO in future) to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 * 20. `pauseContract()`:  Emergency function to pause the contract in case of critical issues (admin/DAO controlled).
 * 21. `unpauseContract()`: Function to unpause the contract (admin/DAO controlled).
 * 22. `getPlatformFeePercentage() public view returns (uint256)`: Retrieves the current platform fee percentage.
 * 23. `getContractBalance() public view returns (uint256)`: Retrieves the contract's current ETH balance.
