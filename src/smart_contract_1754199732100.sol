Here's a Solidity smart contract named `ADAPTProtocol` that incorporates a variety of advanced, creative, and trending concepts. It focuses on a self-optimizing, community-governed system for digital asset management, featuring dynamic fee structures, a unique reputation system, time-locked yield, and conditional redemptions, all designed to be distinct from existing open-source protocols by their unique combination and specific mechanics.

## ADAPTProtocol: Adaptive Digital Asset Preservation & Time-Locked Rights Protocol

### Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `ADAPTProtocol`

**Core Idea:** `ADAPTProtocol` is a self-optimizing, community-governed system designed to preserve and grow digital assets. It achieves this through adaptive allocation strategies, dynamic fee adjustments, and a unique "Stewardship Score" reputation system. The protocol dynamically adjusts its operations, fees, and yield distributions based on an internal "Economic Health Index" (EHI) and individual user behavior, aiming for long-term sustainability and value accrual in a decentralized manner. It simulates complex financial strategies and interactions within a simplified on-chain model to demonstrate its core concepts without direct reliance on external DeFi protocols, thus ensuring uniqueness.

### Function Summary:

**I. Core Protocol Management (Owner/Governance Controlled)**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, setting the deployer as the initial owner and basic parameters.
2.  `pauseProtocol()`: Allows the owner or governance to pause critical contract functions in an emergency.
3.  `unpauseProtocol()`: Allows the owner or governance to unpause critical contract functions.
4.  `updateEconomicHealthIndex(uint256 _newEHI)`: Owner/governance updates the protocol's `EconomicHealthIndex`, which influences adaptive behaviors like fee rates and strategy risk tolerances.
5.  `updateBaseFeeRate(uint256 _newBaseFeeBasisPoints)`: Owner/governance sets the baseline fee rate for transactions.
6.  `updateYieldLockDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Owner/governance sets the duration for which a portion of earned yield is time-locked.
7.  `setStrategy(uint256 _strategyId, string memory _name, uint256 _simulatedYieldBasisPoints, uint256 _simulatedRiskFactor)`: Owner/governance defines or updates details of a simulated investment strategy within the protocol.
8.  `proposeStrategyAllocation(uint256[] memory _strategyIds, uint256[] memory _percentages)`: Initiates a governance proposal to change the allocation percentages among different internal strategies.
9.  `enactStrategyAllocation(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on strategy allocation proposal.
10. `rebalancePools()`: Triggers the internal rebalancing of assets based on the currently active strategy allocations. This simulates moving funds between different internal strategies.
11. `updateStrategyPerformance(uint256 _strategyId, uint256 _newSimulatedYieldBasisPoints)`: Owner/governance updates the simulated yield performance of a specific strategy, mimicking external market changes.
12. `simulateExternalOracleUpdate(uint256 _newPrice)`: Simulates an update from an external price oracle, primarily used for conditional redemption triggers. (In a real system, this would be an actual oracle feed).
13. `setMinimumStewardshipScoreForProposal(uint256 _minScore)`: Sets the minimum `StewardshipScore` required to submit a governance proposal.

**II. User Interaction & Asset Management**

14. `depositAssets(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to deposit assets into the protocol's pool, contributing to the TVL and potentially increasing their Stewardship Score.
15. `requestWithdrawal(uint256 _amount)`: Initiates a withdrawal request. Funds become available after a cool-down period.
16. `executeWithdrawal()`: Completes a previously requested withdrawal after its unlock time has passed.
17. `setConditionalRedemption(uint256 _targetPrice, uint256 _triggerAmount)`: Allows a user to set an automatic redemption condition (e.g., if a linked asset price drops to a certain level, withdraw X amount).
18. `checkAndExecuteConditionalRedemption(address _user)`: An external call (e.g., by a keeper bot) to check if a user's conditional redemption criteria are met and execute it.
19. `distributeYield()`: Public function (callable by anyone, incentivized maybe?) to trigger the distribution of accumulated yield to all participants, based on their share and Stewardship Score.
20. `claimAvailableYield()`: Allows users to claim their immediately available portion of earned yield.
21. `claimTimeLockedYield()`: Allows users to claim the portion of their yield that has passed its time-lock.

**III. Stewardship Score & Adaptive Behavior**

22. `getCalculatedFeeRate(address _user)`: Returns the dynamic fee rate for a given user, which adjusts based on the EHI and the user's Stewardship Score.
23. `getStewardshipScore(address _user)`: Returns the current Stewardship Score of a user.
24. `_adjustStewardshipScore(address _user, int256 _adjustment)`: Internal helper function to adjust a user's Stewardship Score based on their actions (e.g., positive for long-term deposits/voting, negative for frequent withdrawals).

**IV. Governance (Lightweight)**

25. `proposeParameterChange(string memory _description, bytes4 _targetFunctionSelector, uint256 _newValue)`: Allows users with sufficient Stewardship Score to propose changes to a general protocol parameter (e.g., fee model parameters).
26. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows users to vote for or against an active governance proposal.
27. `enactParameterChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on parameter change proposal.

        // 3. `claimAvailableYield` and `claimTimeLockedYield` calculate current accrued amount.

        // Given the constraints and desire for 20+ functions, I will make `distributeYield` a 'protocol-wide'
        // accrual trigger that conceptually increases value, and leave the per-user calculations to `claim` functions.
