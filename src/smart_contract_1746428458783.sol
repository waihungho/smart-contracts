Okay, let's create a smart contract concept that's a bit different from standard tokens, DeFi primitives, or NFTs.

How about a "Predictive State Machine Controller"? This contract manages its internal state based on complex conditions, potentially influenced by simulated "predictive" data (like oracle feeds indicating market sentiment, volatility forecasts, or abstract system health metrics). It also controls the flow of abstract "flux units" and restricts actions based on its current operational state.

It's advanced because it involves intricate state transition logic, conditional access control, and a simulated interaction with external data that influences its core behavior in a non-linear way. It's creative because the "states" and "flux" are abstract concepts applicable to various scenarios (e.g., managing a decentralized system's operational mode, controlling access to features in a dApp based on perceived network conditions, governing resource allocation in a complex protocol). It's trendy in that it incorporates the *idea* of reacting to external conditions/predictions, which is relevant in dynamic Web3 environments. It avoids duplicating standard token or simple vault patterns.

**Concept:** **Quantum Flux State Controller**

This contract represents a system that can operate in different "Dimensional States". The current state affects what actions are permissible and how an abstract resource, "Flux Units", can be managed. State transitions are governed by complex rules involving the current state, the target state, accumulated "Flux Units", and an external "Resonance Factor" (representing a form of predictive input or environmental data).

## Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFluxStateController`

**Concept:** A smart contract managing operational states and an abstract resource ("Flux Units") based on complex, state-dependent conditions and external "Resonance Factor" input. Simulates response to predictive data influencing state transitions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Dimensional States:** An `enum` defining distinct operational states.
2.  **Flux Units:** An integer variable representing a mutable resource within the contract.
3.  **Resonance Factor:** An integer variable updated by a designated "Oracle" address, simulating external data influence.
4.  **State Transition Logic:** Rules defining when and how the contract can move between states, based on Flux, Resonance, and a cooldown period.
5.  **State-Dependent Logic:** Functions behave differently or are restricted based on the current state.
6.  **Roles:** Basic access control for critical functions (Owner, Manager, Oracle).

**Function Summary:**

*   **State Management (7 functions):**
    *   `getCurrentState()`: Get the current dimensional state.
    *   `getLastStateTransitionTime()`: Get the timestamp of the last state change.
    *   `requestStateTransition(newState)`: Attempt to change the state to a new specified state. Checks all conditions.
    *   `canTransitionTo(newState)`: Check if a transition to a specific state is currently possible based on conditions.
    *   `getStateTransitionCooldown()`: Get the required time between state transitions.
    *   `isStateTransitionOnCooldown()`: Check if the contract is currently in a state transition cooldown period.
    *   `getValidNextStates()`: List states reachable from the current state based on rules (doesn't check *dynamic* conditions like flux/resonance).

*   **Flux Management (7 functions):**
    *   `getFluxUnits()`: Get the current amount of flux units.
    *   `addFlux(amount)`: Add flux units (state-restricted).
    *   `removeFlux(amount)`: Remove flux units (state-restricted).
    *   `transferFlux(recipient, amount)`: Transfer flux units to another address (state-restricted).
    *   `setFluxLimit(limit)`: Set the maximum allowed flux units (Manager/Owner only).
    *   `getFluxLimit()`: Get the current flux limit.
    *   `getStateSpecificFluxAllowance(state)`: Get the max add/remove amounts allowed in a specific state.

*   **Resonance & Predictive Data (4 functions):**
    *   `getResonanceFactor()`: Get the current resonance factor value.
    *   `updateResonanceFactor(newFactor)`: Update the resonance factor (Oracle only, may be state-restricted).
    *   `requestPredictionDataUpdate()`: Simulates requesting new predictive data (updates resonance, maybe triggers internal checks - Oracle only, time-limited).
    *   `getLastPredictionDataUpdateTime()`: Get the timestamp of the last prediction data update.

*   **Configuration & Administration (8 functions):**
    *   `setManager(account)`: Set the address with the Manager role (Owner only).
    *   `setOracle(account)`: Set the address with the Oracle role (Owner only).
    *   `setStateTransitionCooldown(seconds)`: Set the required cooldown duration (Manager/Owner only).
    *   `setRequiredResonanceForTransition(fromState, toState, minResonance)`: Configure the minimum resonance required for a specific state transition (Manager/Owner only).
    *   `getRequiredResonanceForTransition(fromState, toState)`: Get the configured minimum resonance for a transition.
    *   `setStateSpecificFluxAllowance(state, maxAdd, maxRemove)`: Configure flux operation limits for a specific state (Manager/Owner only).
    *   `setInitialState(initialState)`: Set the state the contract starts in (Constructor or Owner only before initialization).
    *   `getStateName(state)`: Helper function to get the string name of a state.

**Total Functions: 7 + 7 + 4 + 8 = 26**
