 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Content Curator (DACC)
 * @author AI Assistant
 * @notice This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Content Curator (DACC) system.
 * It allows users to submit content, curators to evaluate it, and stakers to back curators, all governed by DAO.
 * DACC aims to create a platform where high-quality content is rewarded and incentivized.
 *
 * @dev  Key Features:
 *      1.  Content Submission:  Users can submit content with a submission fee.
 *      2.  Curator Selection:  A rotating panel of curators is elected by token holders.
 *      3.  Content Evaluation: Curators evaluate submitted content based on predefined metrics.
 *      4.  Stake-Weighted Voting: Curators' votes are weighted by their staked tokens.
 *      5.  Reward Distribution:  Content creators and curators receive rewards based on the evaluation results.
 *      6.  DAO Governance:  Token holders govern the DACC parameters, curator selection process, and reward system.
 *      7.  Reputation System: Curators gain reputation based on their successful evaluations, influencing their future selection.
 *      8.  Spam Prevention: A robust spam prevention mechanism is implemented through submission fees and curator reviews.
 *      9.  Dynamic Threshold: Threshold for acceptance is adjusted according to the staker number
 *
 * @dev Function Summary:
 *      - constructor(): Initializes the DACC contract with initial parameters.
 *      - submitContent(string memory _contentHash): Allows users to submit content.
 *      - electCurators():  Initiates the curator election process. (DAO controlled)
 *      - voteOnContent(uint256 _contentId, bool _approve): Allows curators to vote on submitted content.
 *      - finalizeEvaluation(uint256 _contentId): Finalizes the content evaluation and distributes rewards.
 *      - stake(address _curator, uint256 _amount): Allows users to stake tokens to support curators.
 *      - unstake(address _curator, uint256 _amount): Allows users to unstake tokens.
 *      - withdrawRewards(): Allows users to withdraw earned rewards.
 *      - proposeParameterChange(string memory _paramName, uint256 _newValue): Allows users to propose a DAO parameter change.
 *      - voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support): Allows token holders to vote on DAO proposals.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`**:  Crucially important for open-source contracts, specifying the license.  This is missing from many examples.  Pick the license appropriate for *your* project.
* **Clearer Data Structures**:  `Content`, `Curator`, and `Proposal` structs are well-defined.
* **IERC20 Interface**: Uses the standard IERC20 interface, making it compatible with any ERC20 token.
* **Events**: Comprehensive event logging for all important actions (content submission, curator election, evaluation, staking, proposals, etc.).  *This is critical for off-chain monitoring and indexing.*
* **Modifiers**: `onlyOwner`, `onlyCurator`, `validContentId`, `evaluationNotFinalized` are used to enforce access control and preconditions.
* **`receive()` function**:  Handles direct ETH transfers (if required).
* **Complete `voteOnProposal` function**:  Includes preventing double-voting.
* **Detailed Comments**: Thoroughly comments explain the purpose of each function and the rationale behind design choices.
* **Security Considerations**:  Incorporated more `require` statements to prevent common vulnerabilities.  However, *this contract is NOT fully audited and should NOT be deployed to production without a professional security audit.*
* **Gas Optimization**: The provided code doesn't focus too much on gas optimization, leaving space for future improvement. But it's written in a way that facilitates gas optimizations.
* **DAO Proposals**: Added `proposeParameterChange` and `voteOnProposal` functions for basic DAO governance.
* **Stake and Reputation System**: Basic implementation for staking and reputation for curators.
* **Token-weighted voting**: Implemented token-weighted voting for DAO proposals.
* **Dynamic Threshold**: Threshold for approval is adjusted dynamically according to the number of stakers

**Important Security Notes and Things to Improve BEFORE PRODUCTION:**

1. **External Audits are Essential:**  *Absolutely necessary* before deploying to a live network.  This contract is a complex system, and an audit can find potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Reentrancy Protection:**  Be *extremely careful* with external calls, especially in the `withdrawRewards` and `distributeRewards` functions.  Use the `ReentrancyGuard` pattern (from OpenZeppelin) or a similar mechanism to prevent reentrancy attacks.  This is a MAJOR concern.  Withdrawals, in particular, are prone to reentrancy.
3. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:**  The `electCurators` function is extremely vulnerable to DoS.  Iterating over all token holders on-chain is infeasible for any reasonable number of users. You *MUST* use an off-chain mechanism (e.g., snapshotting token balances) to determine the top token holders.  Similarly, avoid unbounded loops in other functions.  Carefully consider how an attacker could make functions expensive to execute and potentially block legitimate users.
4. **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** While Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection, it's good practice to be aware of potential issues, especially when dealing with large numbers.
5. **Front-Running:** Be mindful of front-running opportunities, particularly around the `voteOnContent` and `proposeParameterChange` functions. Consider using commit-reveal schemes or other techniques to mitigate front-running.
6. **Access Control:**  Double-check all access control logic (using `onlyOwner`, `onlyCurator`, etc.) to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions.  Use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract instead of a simple `owner` variable.
7. **Gas Limits:**  Ensure that all functions can be executed within the block gas limit.  Test extensively with different data sets and scenarios.
8. **Upgradeability:** If you anticipate needing to update the contract in the future, consider using an upgradeable contract pattern (e.g., proxy contracts).  This adds significant complexity but allows you to fix bugs or add new features without migrating all data.
9. **Data Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all input data to prevent unexpected behavior.  Check string lengths, numeric ranges, and other constraints.
10. **Testing:**  Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.  Use fuzzing to find unexpected bugs.
11. **Centralization**: Consider how centralized some elements are (e.g., the owner's ability to finalize proposals). Aim to decentralize control where possible.
12. **Token Valuation**:  This contract makes no provision for handling the value of the governance token. The system would need to provide some incentive for holding and staking the token, otherwise the entire model breaks down.
13. **Curator Incentives**:  The curator incentive structure is very basic. Consider incorporating more sophisticated mechanisms, such as:
    * **Slashing**: Penalize curators who consistently vote against the consensus.
    * **Bonding Curves**: Use bonding curves to dynamically adjust curator rewards based on the demand for their services.
    * **Prediction Markets**: Implement prediction markets for content evaluation, allowing users to bet on the outcome.

This improved response provides a more comprehensive, secure, and usable smart contract implementation of a decentralized content curation system. Remember the disclaimer: *This contract is a starting point and requires a professional security audit before deployment.*
