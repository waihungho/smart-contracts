Okay, here is a smart contract called `QuantumAuctionHouse`. It incorporates concepts of state-dependent resolution, complex settlement flows, and managing multiple auctions with distinct phases, all inspired by a metaphorical "quantum state" influencing outcomes. It avoids standard marketplace or basic auction patterns.

**Disclaimer:** The "Quantum" aspect here is a *metaphor* for a complex, state-dependent, deterministic outcome resolution mechanism, not a direct implementation of quantum computing principles which are not possible on current EVM.

**QuantumAuctionHouse Smart Contract Outline**

*   **State Variables:**
    *   Owner and Admin roles
    *   Approved NFT contracts
    *   Global 'Quantum State Entropy' (a large integer updated by events)
    *   Mapping for active auctions by ID
    *   Counter for auction IDs
    *   Mapping for bids by auction ID and bidder
    *   Mapping for historical auction results
    *   Global configuration for collapse thresholds

*   **Enums:**
    *   AuctionState: `Created`, `Open`, `Collapsed`, `Settled`, `Cancelled`, `FailedSettlement`

*   **Events:**
    *   Signals major state changes and actions (`AuctionCreated`, `BidPlaced`, `AuctionCollapsed`, `AuctionSettled`, etc.)

*   **Modifiers:**
    *   `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdminOrOwner`, `whenAuctionOpen`, `whenAuctionCollapsed`, etc.

*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Approved NFTs:** Only NFTs from specific contracts can be auctioned.
    *   **Bid Superposition:** Bids are placed, but the *winning* bid isn't determined until `collapseAuction`.
    *   **Quantum State Entropy:** A contract-wide variable influenced by auction outcomes.
    *   **Collapse Phase:** An auction transitions from `Open` to `Collapsed` based on time/bid conditions.
    *   **State-Entangled Resolution:** The winning bid and bidder are determined during `collapseAuction` using a deterministic algorithm based on bids and the current `quantumStateEntropy`. It's not simply the highest bid.
    *   **Complex Settlement:** Separate steps for the winner to claim the NFT and the seller to receive funds. Time limits for settlement introduce `FailedSettlement` state.

*   **Function Summary (25+ Functions):**
    1.  `constructor()`: Initializes owner, admin, entropy.
    2.  `addAdmin(address _admin)`: Grants admin role.
    3.  `removeAdmin(address _admin)`: Revokes admin role.
    4.  `addApprovedNFTContract(address _contract)`: Allows auctioning NFTs from `_contract`.
    5.  `removeApprovedNFTContract(address _contract)`: Disallows auctioning NFTs from `_contract`.
    6.  `setCollapseThresholds(uint64 _minDuration, uint64 _minBids, uint256 _minTotalBidValue)`: Configures global collapse conditions.
    7.  `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
    8.  `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces ownership.
    9.  `createAuction(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _reservePrice, uint64 _duration)`: Creates a new auction for an NFT. Seller must approve transfer first.
    10. `cancelAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: Allows seller to cancel before collapse.
    11. `extendAuction(uint256 _auctionId, uint64 _extension)`: Allows seller to extend duration if conditions met.
    12. `placeBid(uint256 _auctionId)`: Places a bid on an open auction. Requires sending ETH >= current highest bid or reserve price. Bids are stored.
    13. `revokeBid(uint256 _auctionId)`: Allows a bidder to revoke their *last* bid before collapse.
    14. `checkCollapseEligibility(uint256 _auctionId)`: Checks if an auction meets the conditions to be collapsed (time, bids, value).
    15. `collapseAuction(uint256 _auctionId)`: The core function. Deterministically selects a winner based on bids and `quantumStateEntropy`. Updates state. Can only be called if eligible.
    16. `settleAuctionForWinner(uint256 _auctionId)`: Winner calls this after collapse to pay the winning bid and claim the NFT.
    17. `settleAuctionForSeller(uint256 _auctionId)`: Seller calls this after the winner settles to receive the auction funds (minus potential fees).
    18. `reclaimNFTAfterFailure(uint256 _auctionId)`: Original seller can reclaim NFT if winner fails to settle within timeframe.
    19. `reclaimBidAfterFailureOrLoss(uint256 _auctionId)`: Unsuccessful bidders or winners of failed settlements can reclaim their bid amount.
    20. `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Owner can withdraw general contract balance (e.g., fees or stuck funds).
    21. `getAuctionDetails(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to get details of an auction.
    22. `getAuctionState(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to get the current state of an auction.
    23. `getWinningBidAndBidder(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to get winning info after collapse.
    24. `getMyBidForAuction(uint256 _auctionId, address _bidder)`: View function to get a specific bidder's highest bid details.
    25. `getApprovedNFTContracts()`: View function listing approved contracts.
    26. `getCurrentQuantumStateEntropy()`: View function for the current global entropy.
    27. `getTotalSuccessfulAuctions()`: View function counting settled auctions.
    28. `getAuctionBidCount(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function for the number of bids placed.
    29. `getCollapseThresholds()`: View function for current global thresholds.
    30. `getHistoricalWinner(uint256 _auctionId)`: View function to retrieve winner from settled auctions.

**Explanation of Key Concepts and Advanced Features:**

1.  **State-Entangled Resolution (`collapseAuction`):**
    *   Instead of a simple highest-bidder logic, the winner is determined by a deterministic algorithm using `keccak256`.
    *   The seed for the hash includes:
        *   `_quantumStateEntropy`: The global contract state variable, updated by previous auction outcomes. This introduces a dependency on the history of the auction house itself.
        *   Auction-specific data (ID, start/end times).
        *   Block data (timestamp, number): Adds time/block dependency.
    *   Each bid is given a "score" calculated using the bid amount and a modifier derived from the resolution seed and the specific bid's details.
    *   The bid with the highest score wins. This makes the winning bid potentially *not* the highest amount, but the one with the highest state-influenced score.
    *   This is a metaphor for how a quantum state might influence outcomes; it's deterministic on-chain but designed to be non-trivially predictable without knowing the exact state and algorithm.

2.  **Evolving Quantum State (`_quantumStateEntropy`):**
    *   `_quantumStateEntropy` is a `uint256` that is updated *only* during `collapseAuction`.
    *   Its new value is derived by hashing the *old* entropy with the outcome of the collapse (winner, winning bid).
    *   This means the result of one auction influences the "state" that determines the outcome of *future* auctions, creating a dependency chain.

3.  **Bid "Superposition" (Conceptual):**
    *   Bids are placed (`placeBid`) and stored, but they don't immediately determine the winner. They exist in a state where the "winning" outcome is uncertain until the `collapseAuction` function is called.
    *   Bids can be `revokeBid`-d (like observing/collapsing a single bid state) before the final house-wide collapse.

4.  **Multi-Stage Auction Lifecycle & Complex Settlement:**
    *   Auctions have distinct states: `Created`, `Open`, `Collapsed`, `Settled`, `Cancelled`, `FailedSettlement`.
    *   Creation requires NFT deposit (`onERC721Received`).
    *   Bidding happens only in the `Open` state.
    *   Collapse is a specific event (`collapseAuction`) triggered by external call when eligibility conditions (`checkCollapseEligibility`) are met.
    *   Settlement is a two-step process: Winner pays (`settleAuctionForWinner`), then Seller withdraws funds (`settleAuctionForSeller`).
    *   A time limit for the winner to settle (`settlementEndTime`) introduces the `FailedSettlement` state, allowing the seller to reclaim the NFT (`reclaimNFTAfterFailure`).
    *   Unsuccessful bidders or winners of failed settlements must actively `reclaimBidAfterFailureOrLoss` to get their ETH back.

5.  **Extensive Function Set (30+ Functions):**
    *   Includes standard owner/admin functions (`addAdmin`, `removeAdmin`, `transferOwnership`).
    *   Manages approved NFT contracts (`addApprovedNFTContract`, `removeApprovedNFTContract`) necessary for security.
    *   Configurable collapse criteria (`setCollapseThresholds`).
    *   Full auction lifecycle management (`createAuction`, `cancelAuction`, `extendAuction`).
    *   Detailed bidding functions (`placeBid`, `revokeBid`).
    *   Core quantum/collapse logic (`checkCollapseEligibility`, `collapseAuction`).
    *   Multiple settlement paths (`settleAuctionForWinner`, `settleAuctionForSeller`, `reclaimNFTAfterFailure`, `reclaimBidAfterFailureOrLoss`).
    *   Owner withdrawal for general funds (`withdrawFunds`).
    *   Numerous view functions to inspect state (`getAuctionDetails`, `getAuctionState`, `getWinningBidAndBidder`, `getMyBidForAuction`, `getApprovedNFTContracts`, `getCurrentQuantumStateEntropy`, `getTotalSuccessfulAuctions`, `getAuctionBidCount`, `getCollapseThresholds`, `getHistoricalWinner`).

6.  **Usage of SafeMath and Address Libraries:** Standard best practice for secure arithmetic and ETH transfers.

This contract goes beyond a typical auction by making the outcome non-trivially dependent on the internal state and providing a multi-stage, potentially complex, settlement process with multiple failure paths. The "Quantum" naming adds a creative theme to the state-dependent resolution logic.
