/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It facilitates art submission, community-driven curation, NFT minting, fractional ownership,
 * decentralized governance, exhibitions, and more, pushing the boundaries of on-chain art management.

 * **Outline & Function Summary:**

 * **1. Art Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArt(string _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to submit their art with metadata URI for curation.
 *    - `voteOnSubmission(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted art.
 *    - `finalizeSubmission(uint256 _submissionId)`: Finalizes a submission after voting period, minting NFT if approved.
 *    - `getSubmissionDetails(uint256 _submissionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art submission.
 *    - `getApprovedSubmissions()`: Returns a list of IDs of approved art submissions.
 *    - `getPendingSubmissions()`: Returns a list of IDs of pending art submissions.

 * **2. NFT Minting & Management:**
 *    - `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _submissionId)`: (Internal) Mints an NFT for approved artwork.
 *    - `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of a collective artwork NFT.
 *    - `burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Governed) Burns a collective artwork NFT (requires DAO proposal).
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a specific collective artwork NFT.
 *    - `getTotalArtworks()`: Returns the total number of artworks in the collective.

 * **3. Fractional Ownership & Management:**
 *    - `fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionCount)`: Fractionalizes a collective artwork into ERC1155 tokens.
 *    - `redeemFractionalOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Allows fractional owners to redeem their fractions (governed).
 *    - `getFractionalOwners(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns list of fractional owners for a specific artwork.
 *    - `getFractionalBalance(uint256 _artworkId, address _owner)`: Gets the fractional balance of an owner for an artwork.

 * **4. Decentralized Governance & Proposals:**
 *    - `createProposal(string _title, string _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes memory _data)`: Members can create governance proposals.
 *    - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _vote)`: Members can vote on active governance proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal.
 *    - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific governance proposal.
 *    - `getProposalVotes(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves vote counts for a specific proposal.
 *    - `getProposalsByType(ProposalType _proposalType)`: Returns list of proposal IDs by type.

 * **5. Exhibition & Display Management:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _name, string _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Creates a virtual exhibition.
 *    - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds a collective artwork to an exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Removes an artwork from an exhibition (governed).
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns list of artwork IDs in an exhibition.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Returns list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.

 * **6. Treasury & Financial Management (Basic Example - can be expanded):**
 *    - `depositToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the DAAC treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: (Governed) Allows withdrawing ETH from the treasury (requires DAO proposal).
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current ETH balance of the DAAC treasury.

 * **7. Membership & Roles (Basic Example - can be expanded):**
 *    - `becomeMember()`: Allows users to become members of the DAAC (basic example - could be token-gated, etc.).
 *    - `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAAC.
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the total number of DAAC members.

 * **8. Utility & Configuration:**
 *    - `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _votingPeriod)`: (Governor Only) Sets the voting period for submissions and proposals.
 *    - `getVotingPeriod()`: Returns the current voting period.
 *    - `pauseContract()`: (Governor Only) Pauses critical contract functionalities.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: (Governor Only) Resumes paused contract functionalities.
 *    - `isPaused()`: Returns whether the contract is currently paused.
