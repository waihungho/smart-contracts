Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a concept I'll call "Genesis Bloom Protocol".

**Concept:** This protocol allows users to create "Seeds". These Seeds are on-chain entities that require "Nourishment" (ETH or approved ERC20 tokens) over time to maintain "Vitality" and progress through "Growth Stages". Vitality decays automatically over time if not replenished. Growth only occurs when Vitality is above a certain threshold. If Vitality drops too low, the Seed "Withers". If a Seed reaches the maximum Growth Stage and high Vitality, it can be "Bloomed" into a unique "Bloom" NFT (ERC721). The protocol incorporates admin controls for tuning parameters, asset management, and interaction with an external NFT contract.

This concept involves timed state changes, resource management (feeding), conditional state transitions (growth, withering, blooming), interaction with external contracts (ERC20, ERC721), and distinct lifecycle phases for the on-chain entity (Seed). It goes beyond standard token or simple DAO contracts.

### **Genesis Bloom Protocol: Outline and Function Summary**

**Concept:** A decentralized protocol for cultivating on-chain "Seeds" that require timed nourishment to grow and eventually bloom into unique NFTs.

**Core Components:**
1.  **Seeds:** Unique on-chain entities with state (Vitality, Growth Stage, Last Nourished Time).
2.  **Nourishment:** Depositing ETH or approved ERC20 tokens into a Seed to increase its Vitality.
3.  **Vitality:** A metric that decays over time and is replenished by Nourishment. Must be above a threshold for growth.
4.  **Growth Stages:** A metric that increases over time, but only if Vitality is sufficient.
5.  **Blooming:** Converting a mature Seed (max Growth Stage, high Vitality) into a Bloom NFT.
6.  **Withering:** The state reached when Vitality drops too low, potentially allowing claiming of remaining assets.
7.  **Bloom NFTs:** Unique ERC721 tokens created from successfully Bloomed Seeds.
8.  **Admin Controls:** Parameters for tuning decay rates, growth rates, thresholds, fees, and allowed nourishment tokens.

**Function Summary (Grouped by Category):**

**A. Protocol Administration (Admin Only)**
1.  `setBloomNFTContract`: Sets the address of the external ERC721 contract for Blooms.
2.  `setGrowthRatePerSecond`: Sets how much Growth Stage increases per second (if conditions met).
3.  `setDecayRatePerSecond`: Sets how much Vitality decreases per second.
4.  `setBloomThresholds`: Sets the minimum Growth Stage and Vitality required to Bloom.
5.  `setWitherThreshold`: Sets the Vitality level below which a Seed is considered Withered.
6.  `setNourishmentVitalityIncrease`: Sets how much Vitality increases per unit of nourishment asset (per token/wei).
7.  `setNourishmentDecayConsumptionRate`: Sets the percentage of nourishment assets consumed during vitality decay.
8.  `setBloomNourishmentConsumptionRate`: Sets the percentage of nourishment assets consumed upon blooming.
9.  `setWitherAssetClaimPercentage`: Sets the percentage of remaining assets claimable from a withered seed.
10. `setAllowedNourishmentToken`: Whitelists/unwhitelists an ERC20 token for nourishment.
11. `withdrawProtocolFees`: Allows admin to withdraw accrued protocol fees (from consumption).
12. `pauseProtocol`: Pauses most protocol interactions.
13. `unpauseProtocol`: Unpauses the protocol.

**B. User Actions**
14. `createSeed`: Creates a new Seed entity for the caller.
15. `nourishSeedEth`: Provides nourishment to a Seed using native ETH.
16. `nourishSeedErc20`: Provides nourishment to a Seed using an approved ERC20 token.
17. `bloomSeed`: Attempts to bloom a mature Seed into a Bloom NFT.
18. `claimWitheredSeedAssets`: Allows the owner of a withered Seed to claim remaining assets.
19. `transferSeedOwnership`: Allows a Seed owner to transfer ownership.
20. `renounceSeedOwnership`: Allows a Seed owner to renounce ownership (transfer to address(0)).

**C. View Functions**
21. `getSeedState`: Retrieves the full state (owner, vitality, growth, times) of a specific Seed.
22. `getCurrentVitality`: Calculates and returns the *current* vitality of a Seed, accounting for decay since last nourishment.
23. `getCurrentGrowthStage`: Calculates and returns the *current* growth stage of a Seed, accounting for time and vitality since last update.
24. `getSeedNourishmentAmount`: Gets the total amount of a specific nourishment asset deposited in a Seed.
25. `getOwnerSeeds`: Returns an array of Seed IDs owned by a specific address.
26. `getTotalSeeds`: Returns the total number of Seeds created.
27. `getAllowedNourishmentTokens`: Returns a list of allowed ERC20 nourishment token addresses.
28. `getProtocolFeeBalance`: Returns the amount of a specific token held by the protocol as fees.

**D. Internal / Helper Functions**
*   `_applyTimedUpdates`: Internal helper to calculate and return state variables *as if* time had passed since last nourishment, applying decay and growth without modifying storage (used by view functions).
*   `_updateSeedState`: Internal helper to apply decay/growth and update seed state *in storage* after a modifying action (nourish, bloom, wither).
*   `_calculateVitalityIncrease`: Internal helper to determine vitality increase from nourishment amount.
*   `_consumeNourishment`: Internal helper to handle asset consumption and fee collection.
*   `_transferAssets`: Internal helper for safe asset transfers.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts/Features:**

1.  **Timed State Changes & Decay:** The `vitality` and `growthStage` of a Seed are not static. `vitality` decreases automatically over time (`decayRatePerSecond`), and `growthStage` increases over time (`growthRatePerSecond`) but only when `vitality` is above a threshold. This introduces a dynamic element and incentivizes user interaction (nourishing) to maintain the state.
2.  **Conditional State Transitions:** Seeds transition through states (Alive -> Withered, Alive -> Bloomed) based on complex conditions involving both static state variables (`isBloomed`, `isWithered`) and dynamically calculated metrics (`currentVitality`, `currentGrowthStage`).
3.  **Internal State Calculation in Views:** The `_applyTimedUpdates` internal function is key. View functions like `getCurrentVitality` and `getSeedState` call this helper to calculate the *current* state as if time had passed, *without* modifying the stored state. This provides up-to-date information to users. Modifying functions (`_updateSeedState`) apply these calculations to storage.
4.  **Asset Management & Consumption:** The contract holds deposited nourishment assets (`seedNourishmentAssets`). These assets are subject to partial consumption upon decay, blooming, or withering, with consumed amounts potentially routed to protocol fees (`protocolFees`). This creates a resource economy tied to the on-chain entities.
5.  **External Contract Interaction:** The protocol directly interacts with an external ERC20 contract (for `transferFrom`) and an external ERC721 contract (for `mint`). This demonstrates integration with other standards.
6.  **Configurable Parameters:** Many core mechanics (rates, thresholds, consumption percentages) are exposed as admin-settable parameters, allowing the protocol to be tuned or evolved without a full code upgrade (within the limits of the existing logic).
7.  **Role-Based Access Control & Pausability:** Uses a simple `AdminRole` and `Pausable` pattern for essential protocol management functions.
8.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Applied to functions making external calls or handling asset transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.
9.  **Error Handling:** Utilizes custom Solidity errors for clearer error reporting (Solidity 0.8+ feature).
10. **Structured Data (Structs & Mappings):** Uses a `Seed` struct to logically group related state variables and nested mappings (`seedNourishmentAssets`) to track per-seed asset balances.
11. **Fixed-Point Arithmetic Simulation:** While not true fixed-point types, the use of constants like `VITALITY_GROWTH_SCALE` and `RATE_SCALE` simulates fixed-point numbers (e.g., 100000 represents 100.000) to allow for fractional values in vitality, growth, rates, and percentages using integer arithmetic, avoiding floating-point issues.
12. **ETH and ERC20 Support:** Handles native currency (`msg.value`) and standard ERC20 tokens for the core `nourish` function.
13. **Asset Claim Mechanics:** Explicitly handles the claim process for withered seeds, including calculating a claimable percentage and transferring remaining assets.
14. **Seed Ownership Transfer:** Allows the on-chain entity itself (the Seed) to be transferred between users before it blooms or withers.

This contract provides a framework for a relatively complex on-chain system with dynamic entities, resource management, and lifecycle events, fitting the criteria for an interesting, advanced, and creative smart contract concept.

**Note on Gas & Scalability:** Some functions, particularly `getOwnerSeeds` and `getAllowedNourishmentTokens` (as implemented simply here), can be gas-intensive if the number of seeds or allowed tokens grows very large. In a production system, these would typically be handled by indexing events off-chain and providing the data via APIs, or by implementing more gas-efficient on-chain data structures (like linked lists), which would add significant complexity. The current implementation prioritizes clarity and demonstrating the core concept within the function count requirement.
