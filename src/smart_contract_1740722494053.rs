/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Prediction Market (DAPM)
 * @author Gemini (Example Creator)
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized autonomous prediction market platform.
 *
 * @dev This contract allows users to create prediction markets on various outcomes,
 *      participate by buying shares representing different outcomes, and claim their winnings
 *      upon market resolution.  It incorporates advanced features like:
 *      - Dynamic Fee Adjustment: Adjusts platform fees based on market volatility.
 *      - Conditional Order Matching: Allows users to specify conditions that must be met before an order is executed.
 *      - Automated Liquidity Provision: Encourages liquidity provision by rewarding liquidity providers proportionally to their stake and market activity.
 *      - Community Governance: Implements a basic governance system using tokens to influence platform parameters.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  Events:  Emitted to track key actions within the contract.
 *  2.  Structs: Data structures used to represent markets, orders, etc.
 *  3.  State Variables: Persistent data stored on the blockchain.
 *  4.  Modifiers:  Reusable code blocks for access control and validation.
 *  5.  Functions:
 *      - `createMarket`:  Creates a new prediction market.
 *      - `placeOrder`:  Places an order to buy shares in a specific outcome.
 *      - `cancelOrder`: Cancels a placed order.
 *      - `resolveMarket`:  Resolves a market, distributing winnings to participants.
 *      - `claimWinnings`:  Allows participants to claim their winnings after market resolution.
 *      - `provideLiquidity`:  Adds liquidity to a market.
 *      - `removeLiquidity`: Removes liquidity from a market.
 *      - `adjustFees`:  Adjusts the platform fees based on market volatility (governance controlled).
 *      - `proposeParameterChange`: Proposes a change to a platform parameter through governance.
 *      - `voteOnProposal`: Votes on a proposed parameter change.

Key Improvements and Explanations:

* **Dynamic Fee Adjustment (via Governance):** The `adjustFees` function is now protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, but a `proposeParameterChange`, `voteOnProposal` and `executeProposal` functions added for decentralized control with governance tokens.  This allows for a more flexible fee structure that can adapt to market conditions.
* **Conditional Order Matching:** `placeOrder` now takes a `bytes memory _condition` parameter.  The order is only placed if `evaluateCondition(_condition)` returns `true`.  **Crucially, the `evaluateCondition` function is a placeholder.**  Implementing actual conditional logic requires VERY careful security considerations (see the warning comments in the code).  Examples:  Using Chainlink to check the price of an asset, or verifying a cryptographic proof.
* **Automated Liquidity Provision:** Incentivizes users to provide liquidity. A fee from trade will be distributed to the liquidity providers. `provideLiquidity` and `removeLiquidity` functions are added.
* **Comprehensive Events:**  The contract now emits events for crucial actions like market creation, order placement/cancellation, market resolution, claiming winnings, liquidity provision/removal, and fee adjustments.  This makes it easier to track the contract's activity off-chain.
* **Governance Token:**  Added a `governanceTokenAddress` state variable and a `governanceTokenSupply` variable (needs to be managed externally).  The `proposeParameterChange` and `voteOnProposal` functions are added to implement a basic governance system.
* **Security Considerations:**  I've added comments highlighting potential security vulnerabilities, especially around the `evaluateCondition` function and `delegatecall`.
* **Error Handling:** Improved error messages to provide more context.
* **Structs:** Introduced structs (`Market`, `Order`, `LiquidityProvider`, `Proposal`) to organize data related to markets, orders, liquidity and proposals, respectively.
* **Modifiers:** Added modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `marketExists`, `marketNotResolved`, `marketEndTimePassed`, `validOutcome`) for cleaner and more secure code.
* **Interfaces:** Defined an `IERC20` interface for interacting with the governance token.
* **Helper Functions:** Added getter functions (`getMarketDescription`, `getMarketEndTime`, `getOrderDetails`, `getProposalDetails`) to easily retrieve market and order details.  This avoids exposing internal data structures directly.
* **Clear Comments:**  Added more detailed comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of the contract.
* **Gas Optimization Notes:**  The contract currently prioritizes clarity and functionality.  A production contract would require further gas optimization (e.g., using assembly, minimizing storage writes).  Iteration using nested loops can be particularly expensive.

To compile and use this contract:

1.  **ERC20 Token:** You'll need to deploy an ERC20 token contract (like a standard OpenZeppelin ERC20) and get its address.  Set the `_governanceTokenAddress` in the constructor to this address.  Mint some tokens to your address to test the governance and trading features.
2.  **Solidity Compiler:** Use a Solidity compiler (version `^0.8.0`) like Remix IDE.
3.  **Deployment:** Deploy the contract to a suitable Ethereum environment (e.g., Ganache, a testnet like Ropsten or Goerli, or mainnet - BE CAREFUL ON MAINNET!).
4.  **Interaction:** Use a tool like Remix or a custom web3/ethers.js script to interact with the contract, calling the functions to create markets, place orders, etc.

This provides a solid foundation for a sophisticated decentralized prediction market platform. Remember to thoroughly test and audit the code before deploying it to a live environment.
