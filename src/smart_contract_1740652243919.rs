/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Reputation System (DDRS) with NFT-Bound Reputation
 * @author AI Assistant
 * @notice This smart contract implements a decentralized reputation system where reputation points are directly tied to ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
 *   This allows reputation to be more granular, project-specific, and transferable alongside the underlying asset/identity represented by the NFT.
 *   The contract also features a dynamic reputation decay mechanism, controlled by a DAO via on-chain governance, to manage the overall distribution of reputation over time.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **NFT Integration:**  Requires an IERC721 contract address upon deployment.  Reputation is awarded *to* specific NFT instances (tokenId).
 * 2.  **Reputation Points:** Reputation is represented as unsigned integers (uint256).
 * 3.  **Awarding Reputation:**  Functions for granting (awardReputation) reputation to specific NFTs. Only the contract owner or designated roles (e.g., DAO) can award reputation.
 * 4.  **Reputation Decay:**  Implements a dynamically adjustable decay rate for reputation.  The decay rate is configurable by a DAO through governance proposals.
 * 5.  **Governance (Simple DAO):**  A simplified DAO structure allowing proposals to change the `decayRate`.  Requires a quorum and voting period.
 * 6.  **Role-Based Access Control:**  Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for owner privileges. `ReputationIssuer` role for issuing reputation.
 * 7.  **NFT Reputation Query:** Functions for querying the reputation associated with a specific NFT.
 * 8.  **Customizable Decay Function:**  The decay function is intentionally kept simple but can be easily extended to include more complex models.
 * 9.  **Emergency Pause:** Allows the contract owner to pause the contract in case of unforeseen issues.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *   - `constructor(address _nftContractAddress, uint256 _initialDecayRate)`: Deploys the contract, setting the NFT contract address and initial decay rate.
 *   - `awardReputation(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _amount)`: Awards reputation points to a specified NFT. Requires the `ReputationIssuer` role.
 *   - `getReputation(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the reputation points associated with a specified NFT.
 *   - `setDecayRate(uint256 _newDecayRate)`:  Sets the reputation decay rate. Only callable by the DAO (represented by the `proposeDecayRateChange` and `executeProposal` functions).
 *   - `proposeDecayRateChange(uint256 _newDecayRate)`: Proposes a change to the decay rate.
 *   - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _supports)`:  Allows users to vote on a decay rate change proposal.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful decay rate change proposal after the voting period.
 *   - `_applyDecay(uint256 _tokenId)`:  Internal function that applies the decay to the reputation of a specific NFT.
 *   - `pause()`: Pauses the contract. Only callable by the owner.
 *   - `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract. Only callable by the owner.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **NFT-Bound Reputation:** This is the core concept. Reputation is explicitly tied to `tokenId` from an ERC721 contract.  This allows for reputation to be specific to a particular asset or identity.  The contract checks that the `tokenId` exists using `nftContract.ownerOf(_tokenId)`.
* **Dynamic Reputation Decay:**  Reputation decays over time.  The `decayRate` determines how quickly reputation diminishes. The `lastDecayTimestamp` tracks when an NFT's reputation was last updated to calculate decay accurately.  The  `_applyDecay` function handles the actual decay calculation.  The `lastGlobalUpdate` is used to optimize the `_applyDecay` and reduce gas cost.  It stores the last time _applyDecay was called and when calculating reputation of an NFT, it considers this timestamp.  The decay is linear for simplicity, but easily extendable.
* **Simplified DAO Governance:**  A basic DAO mechanism is implemented to allow token holders to propose and vote on changes to the `decayRate`. This adds a layer of decentralization to the reputation system's parameters.  Includes:
    * **Proposals:** Stored in the `proposals` mapping.
    * **Voting:** Users can vote for or against a proposal.
    * **Execution:**  A proposal is executed if it passes a quorum and receives a majority vote.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for owner management (e.g., pausing the contract). Also utilizes `AccessControl` to define a `REPUTATION_ISSUER_ROLE` which is required to call `awardReputation`.  This separates the administration of the contract from the ability to issue reputation.  Allows the owner to grant/revoke the `REPUTATION_ISSUER_ROLE`.
* **Pausable Contract:** The contract is pausable using OpenZeppelin's `Pausable`.  This gives the contract owner an emergency stop switch.
* **Events:** Emits events for important actions, making it easier to track reputation changes and governance activity off-chain.
* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require` statements to enforce preconditions and prevent errors.  Includes checks for NFT existence, valid proposal IDs, voting periods, and more.
* **Gas Optimization:**  `_applyDecay` is only called when necessary (when reputation is being awarded or queried).
* **Clear Documentation:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and variable.
* **Security Considerations:** While this contract aims for security, it's crucial to have it audited by security professionals before deploying to a production environment.  Specifically, the simplified DAO implementation should be reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.
* **No Duplicate of Open Source:**  This isn't a direct copy of any existing OpenZeppelin or similar contract. It combines elements but implements a unique reputation system tied to NFTs and a dynamically adjustable decay mechanism.
* **Why this is interesting and trendy:**  Reputation systems are gaining traction in Web3, particularly for DAOs and decentralized marketplaces. Tying reputation to NFTs creates a more persistent and transferable form of reputation. Dynamic decay allows for the system to adapt over time.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Deploy:**  Deploy the contract, providing the address of the ERC721 NFT contract and an initial decay rate.
2.  **Grant Roles:** Grant the `REPUTATION_ISSUER_ROLE` to the accounts that should be allowed to award reputation.
3.  **Award Reputation:** Call `awardReputation` to grant reputation points to specific NFTs.
4.  **Query Reputation:** Call `getReputation` to retrieve the current reputation of an NFT.
5.  **Propose Decay Rate Changes:**  Call `proposeDecayRateChange` to submit a proposal to change the decay rate.
6.  **Vote:**  Call `voteOnProposal` to vote for or against a proposal.
7.  **Execute Proposals:** After the voting period, call `executeProposal` to execute a successful proposal.

This contract provides a foundation for a more sophisticated and decentralized reputation system within the Web3 ecosystem.
