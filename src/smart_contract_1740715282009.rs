/**
 * @title FractionalizedNFTMarketplace
 * @dev This smart contract allows users to fractionalize NFTs, create markets for the fractions,
 *      and participate in auctions to buy the remaining fractions and reclaim the original NFT.
 *
 * @notice This contract introduces a novel approach to NFT liquidity and ownership,
 *         allowing for partial ownership and price discovery of illiquid assets.
 *
 * Functions:
 *   - fractionalizeNFT(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _fractionName, string memory _fractionSymbol, uint256 _numberOfFractions): Divides an NFT into ERC20 tokens representing fractions.
 *   - createFractionMarket(address _fractionToken, uint256 _pricePerFraction): Creates a market for fractionalized tokens.
 *   - buyFractions(address _fractionToken, uint256 _amount) payable: Allows users to buy fractions from the market.
 *   - sellFractions(address _fractionToken, uint256 _amount): Allows users to sell fractions back to the market.
 *   - initiateAuction(address _fractionToken): Initiates an auction to buy the remaining NFT fractions.
 *   - bid(address _fractionToken) payable: Places a bid in the ongoing auction.
 *   - settleAuction(address _fractionToken): Settles the auction and transfers the NFT to the highest bidder.
 *   - reclaimNFT(address _fractionToken): Allows the highest bidder of the completed auction to reclaim the original NFT.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Function Summary & Outline at the Top:**  As requested, a clear description of the contract's purpose and a summary of each function are now at the beginning of the code.
* **FractionToken as Nested Contract:** The `FractionToken` is now declared as a nested contract inside the `FractionalizedNFTMarketplace` contract.  This is more semantically correct since the fractional tokens are intrinsically linked to the marketplace.  The `FractionToken` is deployed *during* the `fractionalizeNFT` function call.
* **Auction Mechanics:**
    * **`initiateAuction`:**  Starts the auction, setting an `auctionEndTime`.  Requires that an auction isn't already active for the NFT.
    * **`bid`:**  Allows users to bid on the NFT. Requires a bid higher than the current `highestBid`.  Refunds the previous highest bidder.
    * **`settleAuction`:**  This is the crucial function.  It allows the auction to be settled, and the NFT is transferred to the highest bidder *only if* that bidder also holds a majority of the fraction tokens.  This is a key innovation.
    * **`reclaimNFT`:** Burns all of the fraction tokens owned by the NFT owner.
* **Majority Ownership Check:** The `settleAuction` function includes a critical check: `require(senderFractionalBalance > fractionalizedNFTs[_fractionToken].numberOfFractions / 2, "Highest bidder does not own majority of fractions");`.  This means the highest bidder *must* control more than 50% of the fractional tokens to be eligible to receive the original NFT.  This encourages token accumulation and real price discovery.
* **Ownership and Access Control:**  The `Ownable` contract is used for privileged functions (setting the minimum auction duration). The `FractionToken`'s minting is restricted to the contract creator (the `FractionalizedNFTMarketplace` contract itself).
* **OpenZeppelin Libraries:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `ERC721`, `ERC20`, `Ownable`, and `SafeMath` for security and best practices.  This is *essential* for a production-ready smart contract.
* **Events:**  Emits events for all significant state changes, making it easier for off-chain applications to track and react to the contract's activity.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements for input validation and preventing common errors.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:** The contract *carefully avoids* re-entrancy vulnerabilities by following the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern and using OpenZeppelin's proven libraries.  It refunds the previous highest bidder *before* updating the `highestBidder` and `highestBid` variables.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:**  Uses `SafeMath` to prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow errors.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `settleAuction` function has the potential for DoS if a malicious user can prevent the highest bidder from calling it.  Consider adding a mechanism for anyone to call `settleAuction` after a certain grace period, with a reward.
* **Gas Optimization:** While the code is functional, it's not yet fully optimized for gas.  Further gas savings could be achieved by:
    * Using more efficient data structures (e.g., packing variables).
    * Caching frequently accessed values.
    * Reducing the number of storage writes.

**How It's Innovative and Trendy:**

1. **NFT Fractionalization:** It allows NFTs to be split into smaller, more liquid pieces, opening up NFT ownership to a wider audience.
2. **Dynamic Price Discovery:** The auction mechanism helps to establish a fair market value for the remaining NFT fractions.
3. **Governance through Ownership:** Requiring the winning bidder to hold a majority of the fractional tokens adds a governance aspect.  The person reclaiming the underlying NFT effectively has the approval (or at least the economic power) of the majority of token holders.
4. **DeFi Integration:** The fractional tokens can be used in other DeFi protocols (e.g., as collateral for loans, in yield farms).

**Important Notes:**

* **Testing:** This contract needs thorough testing before deployment to a live environment. Use a testing framework like Hardhat or Truffle.  Write unit tests for each function and integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios.
* **Auditing:** Before deploying to mainnet, have the contract professionally audited by a reputable smart contract auditing firm.
* **Gas Costs:** Be aware of the gas costs associated with each function, especially `fractionalizeNFT` and `settleAuction`, which involve storage writes.
* **Front-End Interface:** A user-friendly front-end is essential for interacting with this contract.

This is a complex contract and requires a solid understanding of Solidity, NFTs, and DeFi concepts. Use it as a starting point and tailor it to your specific requirements.  Good luck!
