/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation and Skill-Based NFT Platform
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This contract implements a dynamic NFT platform where NFTs represent skills or achievements.
 * NFTs can evolve based on user reputation and skill progression.
 * It incorporates features like skill-based NFTs, reputation points, challenges, leaderboards, and dynamic metadata.
 *
 * ## Contract Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * **1. Core NFT Functionality:**
 *    - `name()`: Returns the name of the NFT collection.
 *    - `symbol()`: Returns the symbol of the NFT collection.
 *    - `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the owner of a given tokenId.
 *    - `balanceOf(address owner)`: Returns the balance of NFTs owned by an address.
 *    - `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfers an NFT from one address to another (standard ERC721).
 *    - `approve(address approved, uint256 tokenId)`: Approves an address to spend a tokenId on behalf of the owner (standard ERC721).
 *    - `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`: Gets the approved address for a tokenId (standard ERC721).
 *    - `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool _approved)`: Sets approval for all tokens for an operator (standard ERC721).
 *    - `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`: Checks if an operator is approved for all tokens of an owner (standard ERC721).
 *    - `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the URI for the metadata of a given tokenId. (Dynamic metadata based on skill level and reputation)
 *
 * **2. Skill and Reputation System:**
 *    - `mintSkillNFT(address to, string memory skillName)`: Mints a new Skill NFT to a user.
 *    - `addExperience(uint256 tokenId, uint256 experiencePoints)`: Adds experience points to a Skill NFT, potentially leveling it up.
 *    - `getSkillLevel(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the current skill level of a Skill NFT.
 *    - `getExperiencePoints(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the current experience points of a Skill NFT.
 *    - `awardReputation(address user, uint256 reputationPoints)`: Awards reputation points to a user (address-based reputation, not NFT specific).
 *    - `deductReputation(address user, uint256 reputationPoints)`: Deducts reputation points from a user.
 *    - `getUserReputation(address user)`: Returns the reputation points of a user.
 *
 * **3. Challenge and Task System:**
 *    - `createChallenge(string memory challengeName, string memory description, uint256 rewardXP, uint256 rewardReputation)`: Creates a new challenge for users to participate in (Admin function).
 *    - `completeChallenge(uint256 challengeId, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows a user to complete a challenge using a specific Skill NFT and claim rewards.
 *    - `getChallengeDetails(uint256 challengeId)`: Returns details of a specific challenge.
 *    - `getActiveChallenges()`: Returns a list of IDs of currently active challenges.
 *
 * **4. Dynamic NFT Metadata:**
 *    - `setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI)`: Sets the base URI for NFT metadata (Admin function).
 *    - `updateTokenMetadata(uint256 tokenId)`: Updates the metadata URI for a given tokenId based on its current state (Internal function, triggered by level up, etc.).
 *
 * **5. Utility and Admin Functions:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Pauses the contract, disabling minting and challenge completion (Admin function).
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract, re-enabling functionalities (Admin function).
 *    - `isContractPaused()`: Returns whether the contract is currently paused.
 *    - `withdrawFees(address payable recipient)`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw any accumulated fees (if any fees are implemented - not in this basic example but could be added).

**Explanation of Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Dynamic Skill-Based NFTs:** The core concept is that NFTs represent skills, and these NFTs are not static. They can level up and evolve based on user activity and experience. This adds a layer of progression and engagement beyond simple collectible NFTs.

2.  **Reputation System (Address-Based):**  While NFTs are skill-based, the contract also incorporates a separate reputation system associated with user addresses. This reputation could be earned through various platform activities (not directly implemented in this example but could be extended - e.g., contributing content, helping others, participating in governance if added). Reputation can influence future features or access within the platform (again, not explicitly coded here but a potential extension).

3.  **Challenge/Task System:**  The inclusion of a challenge system adds gamification and purpose to the NFTs. Users can actively engage with the platform by completing challenges using their Skill NFTs to earn rewards, further driving engagement and NFT evolution.

4.  **Dynamic Metadata (TokenURI):** The `tokenURI` function is designed to be dynamic. It constructs the metadata URI based on the current skill level and skill name of the NFT. This allows for visually evolving NFTs (if the metadata JSON files at those URIs are designed to change appearance based on level). This is a key advanced concept for NFTs beyond static images.

5.  **Combined Progression:** The system combines both NFT-specific progression (skill levels, experience) and user-level progression (reputation). This creates a richer ecosystem where different types of achievements are tracked and rewarded.

6.  **Admin Control and Utility Functions:**  The contract includes standard admin functions like pausing/unpausing, setting the base URI, and a withdrawal function. These are important for contract management and control.

**How it Avoids Open Source Duplication (to the best of my knowledge at this level of abstraction):**

*   **Unique Combination:** While individual components like ERC721, basic level-up systems, or reputation points might exist in open source, the *specific combination* of skill-based dynamic NFTs, address-based reputation, and a challenge system for NFT progression is less likely to be found as a direct, copy-paste open-source project.
*   **Focus on Concept, Not Production Readiness:** This contract is designed to demonstrate the *concept* and the variety of functions. A production-ready version would require much more in-depth security audits, gas optimization, and potentially more complex logic.  The goal here is to be *conceptually* creative and advanced, not to create a fully deployable application directly.
*   **Extensibility:**  The contract is designed to be extensible.  Many areas (reputation mechanics, challenge complexity, metadata structure, level-up logic, potential integration with oracles or off-chain systems) could be expanded upon in unique ways to further differentiate it from existing projects.

**To use this contract effectively:**

1.  **Deploy to a network:** Deploy this Solidity code to a suitable blockchain network (testnet or mainnet).
2.  **Set Base URI:** After deployment, the contract owner should call `setBaseURI()` to point to the location where the NFT metadata JSON files are hosted (e.g., IPFS, centralized server). You would need to create JSON metadata files that correspond to the different skill levels and names and host them at this base URI.
3.  **Mint Skill NFTs:**  The contract owner can then use `mintSkillNFT()` to create initial skill NFTs for users.
4.  **Create Challenges:**  Use `createChallenge()` to set up tasks for users to complete.
5.  **Users Interact:** Users can then interact with the contract, completing challenges, earning experience for their NFTs, and potentially gaining reputation.

Remember that this is a conceptual example. For a real-world application, you'd need to flesh out the metadata, design a front-end interface, consider security and gas optimization more deeply, and potentially integrate with off-chain systems for more complex logic or data.
