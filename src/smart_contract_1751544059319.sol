Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a unique concept: a "Dynamic Synthesis Protocol" where users can stake a fungible "Catalyst" token into non-fungible "Synthesizer Unit" NFTs to generate a third "Essence" token, with the NFT's properties evolving based on the staked amount, duration, and protocol-wide parameters.

This avoids standard ERC20/ERC721 *implementations* by building simplified internal versions or focusing on the *interaction logic* between them, and introduces concepts like dynamic NFT attributes driven by external factors (staking), multi-token interaction, and protocol-defined yield mechanics.

**Concept Outline:**

1.  **Catalyst Token (CAT):** A fungible token (simulated ERC20) required for staking.
2.  **Synthesizer Unit (SYNTH):** A non-fungible token (simulated ERC721) representing a unique synthesis device. Each SYNTH has dynamic attributes (e.g., Efficiency, Purity, Stability).
3.  **Essence Token (ESS):** A fungible token (simulated ERC20) generated by staking CAT in SYNTHs.
4.  **Core Mechanic:** Users stake CAT tokens *into* specific SYNTH NFTs. The amount staked and the duration influence the SYNTH's dynamic attributes and the rate of ESS generation.
5.  **Dynamic Attributes:** SYNTH attributes like Efficiency evolve based on the staked CAT amount, time, and global "Protocol State" parameters set by the contract owner. Higher Efficiency means more ESS generated per CAT staked.
6.  **Essence Generation:** ESS is generated over time based on the staked CAT, the SYNTH's current Efficiency, and the global ESS generation rate.
7.  **Protocol State:** Global parameters affecting all SYNTHs (e.g., base ESS rate, decay factors for efficiency).
8.  **Interaction:** Users can mint SYNTHs, stake/unstake CAT, claim generated ESS, upgrade SYNTH attributes by consuming staked CAT, and transfer SYNTHs (staked CAT remains with the NFT).

**Function Summary (20+ functions):**

1.  **ERC721 Standard (Simplified Internal Implementation for SYNTH):**
    *   `balanceOf(address owner)`: Get the number of SYNTHs owned by an address.
    *   `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Get the owner of a specific SYNTH.
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Safely transfer a SYNTH.
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data)`: Safely transfer a SYNTH with data.
    *   `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfer a SYNTH (less safe).
    *   `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Approve an address to transfer a specific SYNTH.
    *   `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Approve/revoke operator for all tokens.
    *   `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`: Get approved address for a SYNTH.
    *   `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`: Check if an operator is approved for all tokens of an owner.
    *   `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Get the URI for a SYNTH (can reflect dynamic state).

2.  **ERC20 Standard (Simplified Internal Implementation for CAT & ESS):**
    *   `balanceOfCat(address account)`: Get CAT balance of an account.
    *   `transferCat(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer CAT tokens.
    *   `balanceOfEss(address account)`: Get ESS balance of an account.
    *   `transferEss(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer ESS tokens.

3.  **Core Synthesis Logic:**
    *   `mintSynthesizerUnit()`: Mint a new SYNTH NFT to the caller.
    *   `stakeCatalyst(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount)`: Stake CAT tokens into a specific SYNTH. Updates staked amount and potentially starts a new synthesis cycle.
    *   `unstakeCatalyst(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount)`: Withdraw staked CAT from a SYNTH. Calculates and distributes earned ESS before withdrawal.
    *   `claimEssence(uint256 tokenId)`: Claim generated ESS from a specific SYNTH without unstaking CAT.
    *   `calculatePendingEssence(uint256 tokenId)`: View function to calculate how much ESS a SYNTH has generated since the last claim/stake/unstake.
    *   `calculateCurrentEfficiency(uint256 tokenId)`: View function to calculate the SYNTH's current Efficiency based on staked amount, time, and protocol state.
    *   `getSynthesizerAttributes(uint256 tokenId)`: View function to get the current state (staked amount, start time, base attributes, efficiency) of a SYNTH.
    *   `upgradeSynthesizerEfficiency(uint256 tokenId, uint256 catalystCost)`: Consume staked CAT from a SYNTH to permanently boost its base efficiency attribute (Owner or approved can call, requires sufficient staked CAT).

4.  **Protocol State & Admin (Owner Only):**
    *   `updateProtocolConfig(uint256 newBaseEssRate, uint256 newEfficiencyFactor, uint256 newTimeDecayFactor)`: Update global synthesis parameters.
    *   `getProtocolConfig()`: View function to get current global configuration.
    *   `mintCatalyst(address account, uint256 amount)`: Owner function to mint new CAT tokens (for testing/initial distribution).
    *   `renounceOwnership()`: Standard Ownable function.
    *   `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard Ownable function.

This setup provides dynamic interactions between fungible and non-fungible tokens driven by time and staked value, going beyond simple token transfers or static NFTs. The calculation of pending ESS and efficiency on-chain adds complexity.
