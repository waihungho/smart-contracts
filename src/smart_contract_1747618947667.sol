Okay, here is a smart contract incorporating several advanced concepts like conditional releases based on multiple criteria (time, epoch, external oracle data, internal state), handling multiple asset types (ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721), and a decentralized trigger mechanism.

It's named `QuantumFluxVault` to suggest complex, potentially non-linear (condition-based) state changes and asset releases.

This contract attempts to be creative by allowing highly customizable release conditions combined with internal state checks, and trendy by incorporating oracle patterns and NFT handling. It avoids directly copying well-known patterns like standard vesting contracts, simple timelocks, or multi-sigs by creating a more generalized conditional release framework.

     // Warning: This function is NOT efficient for large numbers of NFTs.
     // There's no standard way in ERC721 to list all tokenIds owned by an address.
     // This function is a placeholder and may require off-chain indexing
     // or a custom enumerable extension for practical use.
     // For simplicity here, we can't reliably list all IDs without an extension.
     // Returning an empty array as a placeholder.
     // To actually implement this safely on-chain requires iterating over ALL tokenIds
     // ever minted (if the collection contract supports it, e.g., via Enumerable extension),
     // which is prohibitively expensive.

     // A practical approach might involve tracking deposits/withdrawals or relying on off-chain data.
     // As a simplified placeholder, we can't return actual IDs without an Enumerable extension.
     // If the collection *does* support ERC721Enumerable, you could use tokenOfOwnerByIndex.
     // However, standard ERC721 does not guarantee this.

     // Placeholder returning an empty array. A real implementation needs more info
     // about the specific ERC721 contract's capabilities or off-chain help.
     // For the spirit of the request (complex functions), let's *pretend* we could
     // iterate over a manageable number or were integrated with an enumerable extension.
     // We'll return a simple, potentially incomplete list based on our `nftReservedForCondition`
     // but this doesn't show *all* owned NFTs, just those related to conditions.
     // Let's stick to the limitation and return empty or require Enumerable.

     // Let's refine: We can't list *all* NFTs without Enumerable. We *can* check
     // the owner of a *known* tokenId using `token.ownerOf(tokenId)`.
     // The `nftReservedForCondition` mapping only tells us if an NFT *was* marked
     // for a condition, not if we *still* own it or own others.
