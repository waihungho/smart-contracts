This smart contract, `AdaptiveCognitiveVault`, is designed as a *self-optimizing protocol for dynamic value aggregation*. It introduces a **Self-Sovereign Utility Score (SSUS)** for users, which is dynamically calculated based on various on-chain activities (Utility Sources). The key innovation lies in its **Cognitive Engine**, which can propose and apply adjustments to how different utility sources are weighted, effectively "learning" or "adapting" to protocol goals or market conditions through a semi-autonomous process. Users unlock **adaptive access tiers and benefits** based on their real-time SSUS.

It aims to be advanced, creative, and trendy by incorporating:
1.  **Dynamic On-Chain Metric Weighting:** The protocol itself can adjust the influence of different metrics.
2.  **Semi-Autonomous Optimization:** A "Cognitive Engine" that suggests or directly applies parameter changes.
3.  **Adaptive Access Control:** Benefits and access levels are not static but fluid based on a dynamic score.
4.  **Multi-Owner Quorum System:** For secure, decentralized governance over critical operations.
5.  **Extensible Utility Sourcing:** Easily integrate new on-chain activities as value contributors.

## **Contract Outline & Function Summary: `AdaptiveCognitiveVault`**

This contract is designed to manage and adapt a "Self-Sovereign Utility Score" (SSUS) for users, dynamically adjusting how different on-chain activities contribute to this score, and granting adaptive access/rewards based on it.

### **I. Administrative & Ownership (Quorum-Based)**
*   **`addOwner(address _newOwner)`**: Adds a new address to the list of authorized owners. Requires quorum confirmation.
*   **`removeOwner(address _ownerToRemove)`**: Removes an owner from the list. Requires quorum confirmation.
*   **`setMinConfirmations(uint256 _newMinConfirmations)`**: Sets the minimum number of owner confirmations required for critical actions. Requires quorum confirmation.
*   **`pauseProtocol()`**: Pauses all critical contract functions in an emergency. Requires quorum confirmation.
*   **`unpauseProtocol()`**: Unpauses the contract, resuming normal operation. Requires quorum confirmation.
*   **`emergencyWithdraw(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount)`**: Allows owners to withdraw specified tokens in an emergency. Requires quorum confirmation.

### **II. Utility Source Management**
*   **`registerUtilitySource(bytes32 _sourceId, address _sourceContract, uint256 _initialWeight, string memory _description)`**: Registers a new external smart contract or on-chain metric as a source of utility.
*   **`updateUtilitySourceConfig(bytes32 _sourceId, address _sourceContract, uint256 _newMultiplier, string memory _newDescription)`**: Updates the configuration (e.g., multiplier, description) for an existing utility source.
*   **`deactivateUtilitySource(bytes32 _sourceId, bool _isActive)`**: Activates or deactivates a utility source, affecting its contribution to SSUS calculation.

### **III. Self-Sovereign Utility Score (SSUS) Core**
*   **`reportRawUtilityContribution(address _forUser, bytes32 _sourceId, uint256 _value)`**: An authorized utility source or designated reporter can report a raw utility value for a specific user.
*   **`refreshUserSSUS(address _user)`**: Triggers the recalculation and update of a specific user's SSUS based on the current active weights and reported utility contributions.
*   **`getUserSSUS(address _user)`**: Returns the current, calculated Self-Sovereign Utility Score for a given user.

### **IV. Cognitive Engine & Dynamic Weight Optimization**
*   **`proposeWeightAdjustment(bytes32[] memory _sourceIds, uint256[] memory _newWeights)`**: Owners can propose a new set of weights for multiple utility sources. This proposal requires owner quorum to be `execute`d.
*   **`voteOnWeightAdjustment(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Owners can vote to approve a submitted weight adjustment proposal.
*   **`executeWeightAdjustment(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes a weight adjustment proposal once it has met the minimum confirmation threshold.
*   **`triggerCognitiveRecalibration()`**: Initiates an internal process where the Cognitive Engine assesses protocol metrics and suggests an optimal set of new weights based on its programmed heuristics. This creates a new proposal that still requires owner confirmation for safety, but provides a "smart" suggestion.
*   **`getCurrentWeights()`**: Returns the currently active weights for all registered utility sources.

### **V. Adaptive Access & Reward Mechanisms**
*   **`defineAccessTier(bytes32 _tierId, uint256 _minSSUS, bytes memory _benefitsDescriptor, uint256 _rewardTokenAmount)`**: Defines a new access tier, specifying the minimum SSUS required and a generic descriptor for its benefits.
*   **`updateAccessTierBenefits(bytes32 _tierId, bytes memory _newBenefitsDescriptor, uint256 _newRewardTokenAmount)`**: Updates the benefits associated with an existing access tier.
*   **`checkAccessTier(address _user)`**: Returns the highest access tier a user currently qualifies for based on their SSUS.
*   **`claimTierBenefit(bytes32 _tierId)`**: Allows a user to claim the benefits associated with a specific access tier if they meet the SSUS requirement and have not claimed it recently (if applicable).
*   **`depositToRewardPool(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`**: Allows anyone to deposit tokens into the protocol's reward pool, which can be distributed to users.
*   **`distributeRewardPool(address _tokenAddress, bytes32 _tierId)`**: Owners can trigger the distribution of tokens from the reward pool to users currently in a specified access tier, or the highest tier. Requires quorum confirmation.
