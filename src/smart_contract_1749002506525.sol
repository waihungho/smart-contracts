Okay, let's design a sophisticated smart contract concept: a "Dynamic Yield Vault with Gamified Boosts". This contract will act as a vault for user deposits, simulating investment into multiple yield-generating strategies (which in a real scenario would be external DeFi protocols). It incorporates dynamic elements like changing strategy allocations and APYs (simulated via manager functions), and a creative "gamified" boost mechanism where users can lock funds for a period to receive a yield multiplier represented by a non-transferable utility NFT. It leverages the ERC-4626 standard for vault interoperability.

This contract *simulates* external yield generation and strategy management for demonstration purposes, as interacting with real external protocols and managing complex on-chain strategies is significantly more code and requires deep integration (e.g., with Aave, Compound, Uniswap, etc.). The simulation allows us to focus on the core vault logic, yield calculation based on dynamic factors, and the novel NFT boost mechanism.

**Key Advanced/Trendy Concepts Included:**

1.  **ERC-4626 Vault Standard:** Interoperability with DeFi protocols.
2.  **Simulated Multi-Strategy Yield:** Represents yield diversification without complex external calls.
3.  **Dynamic Strategy Allocation:** Simulates active fund management.
4.  **Dynamic APY (Simulated):** Represents fluctuating market conditions.
5.  **Utility/Gamified NFT Boost:** Creative use of non-transferable NFTs for yield enhancement.
6.  **Yield Reinvestment:** Standard DeFi feature.
7.  **Flash Withdrawal Fee:** Security pattern against certain arbitrage/manipulation types.
8.  **Yield Delegation:** Advanced pattern for transferring yield claiming rights.
9.  **Performance Fee:** Standard vault fee mechanism.
10. **Batch Operations:** Gas optimization for managers.
11. **Event Sourcing (Implicit):** Events capture key state changes.
12. **Role-Based Access Control:** Using a `vaultManager` role.
13. **Pause & Emergency Shutdown:** Critical safety features.
14. **Historical Data Tracking (Simulated):** Provides transparency on past performance.
15. **Upgrade Signaling:** Acknowledges the need for future logic changes (via a state variable/event).

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `DynamicYieldBoostVault`

**Concept:** An ERC-4626 compatible vault that accepts a single asset, simulates investment into multiple yield strategies with dynamic APYs and allocations, and allows users to obtain yield multiplier boosts by locking funds and receiving a non-transferable ERC-721 Boost NFT.

**Sections:**

1.  **Standard ERC-4626 Functions:** Core vault operations defined by the ERC-4626 standard.
2.  **Yield & Strategy Management (Vault Manager Only):** Functions for the designated manager to configure and update yield strategies and vault parameters.
3.  **User Yield & Boost Functions:** Functions for users to interact with their yield, claim boosts, and manage delegations.
4.  **State & Utility Functions (View/Manager):** Functions to query vault state, performance, and manage high-level configurations.

        // A real ERC4626 tracks yield via share price/ratio change.
        // Let's *simplify* for the simulation: totalAssets = sum of userPrincipalAmount + sum of pendingYield.
        // This still requires iteration or separate sums.

        // A better approach for simulation while adhering closer to ERC4626 *concept*
        // is to track a `pricePerShare` and calculate totalAssets = totalSupply * pricePerShare.
        // Let's adjust: totalAssets reflects principal + *hypothetical* global yield accrued
        // proportional to time and average APY, reflected in shares value.
        // This is hard to reconcile with user-specific pending yield and boosts.

        // Let's revert to the simpler simulation: totalAssets is approximation.
        // We need to sum userPrincipalAmount and pendingYield across all users.
        // This requires iterating over users, which is gas-prohibitive.
        // A production vault would track total principal and accrue yield to the vault itself.
        // For this example, let's just return the sum of minted principal. This misses the yield part
        // in the *standard* totalAssets definition, but aligns with our userPrincipal tracking.
        // A better simulation would calculate shares based on (principal + yield) / pricePerShare.
        // Let's implement the ERC4626 `convertToShares` and `convertToAssets` correctly based
        // on a concept of `_assetPerShare` that updates when yield is calculated.
        // This requires a state variable `_assetPerShare` and updating it periodically or on interaction.

        // Re-implementing based on ERC4626: totalAssets = shares supply * assets per share.
        // Assets per share increases with yield.
        // We need a way to track total principal vs. total shares and accrue yield globally.
        // Let's track `totalPrincipalAmount` added by users.
        // Total assets = totalPrincipalAmount + calculated_global_yield.
        // Global yield = (Total Assets at last global update) * AvgAPY * Time / SecondsInYear.
        // This also requires a last global update time and iterating strategies.

        // Okay, final simulation approach for `totalAssets`:
        // `totalPrincipalAmount` tracks the sum of all initial deposits.
        // Yield is calculated *per user* based on *their* principal and boost.
        // `totalAssets` will be `totalPrincipalAmount` + sum of all `pendingYield`.
        // This still requires summing pending yield, which is inefficient.
        // Let's just return `totalPrincipalAmount` for simplicity in this example,
        // acknowledging this deviates slightly from a production ERC4626 that accounts for accrued yield globally.
        // The user-specific `pendingYield` and `calculateCurrentYield` functions are where yield is shown.

        // Simpler still: totalAssets() = sum of user balances as tracked by ERC4626 internal balances + total pending yield.
        // ERC4626 _balances maps address to shares. We need assets.
        // Total assets = sum of userPrincipalAmount mapping values + sum of pendingYield mapping values.
        // Still requires iteration.

        // Okay, a common ERC4626 simulation trick for totalAssets is to return the total principal deposited *that is still in the vault*.
        // This doesn't account for earned yield being part of total assets.
        // Let's stick to the simplified model: `totalAssets` will reflect the sum of principal amounts users have deposited and NOT withdrawn.
        // Yield will be tracked and claimable separately via `pendingYield`. This is a deviation from strict ERC4626 but manageable for simulation.
        // Let's track `totalPooledAssets` which is the sum of principal deposited.
        // And `totalAccumulatedYield` which is the sum of all pendingYield across all users.

        // Tracking `totalPooledAssets`:
        // Increase on deposit/mint, decrease on withdraw/redeem.

        uint256 sumOfPendingYield = 0; // Inefficient, placeholder
        // A real implementation would not sum like this.
        // This simulation will have to skip summing `pendingYield` in `totalAssets`
        // or use a very basic approximation or require manager calls to update global state.
        // Let's return total principal deposited for simplicity, emphasizing yield is separate in this model.

        // Let's make this simulation more ERC4626-like by tracking total principal *and* a simulated 'global yield' value.
        // `totalPrincipalAmount` as state variable.
        // `totalSimulatedYield`: a global pool of simulated yield.
        // Total Assets = `totalPrincipalAmount` + `totalSimulatedYield`.
        // When _updateUserYield is called, calculate *user's* yield, add to `pendingYield[user]`, subtract from `totalSimulatedYield`.
        // When deposit/withdraw happens, need to update `totalSimulatedYield` based on elapsed time.

        // Okay, let's simplify the simulation significantly for `totalAssets` and yield calculation for code brevity:
        // - `totalAssets` = total shares supply (as underlying asset value at 1:1 initially). We won't simulate the asset value per share changing due to yield *in* `totalAssets`.
        // - User yield (`pendingYield`) is calculated based on their shares balance * share value, and updated manually or on interaction.
        // This is NOT a true ERC4626 yield-bearing vault implementation but simplifies the code.

        // FINAL SIMPLIFIED SIMULATION APPROACH:
        // - Use ERC4626's internal `_totalSupply` and `_balances` for shares.
        // - Assume 1 share = 1 asset always for simplicity in ERC4626 standard functions (totalAssets, convertToShares/Assets).
        // - Yield is calculated separately based on user's *shares balance* and time/APY/boost, stored in `pendingYield`.
        // This means ERC4626 `totalAssets` will effectively just reflect the sum of initial principal *represented by shares*.
        // Yield accrual happens *outside* the standard ERC4626 mechanics in this specific simulation.
        // This is a compromise to meet the function count and complexity requirement without building a full yield protocol.

        // Returning base ERC4626 total supply converted to assets at a fixed 1:1 ratio for simplicity.
        // In a real yield vault, this would return principal + globally accrued yield.

**Explanation of Key Design Choices and Simulations:**

1.  **ERC-4626 Standard:** The contract inherits `ERC4626` from OpenZeppelin. This provides a standard interface for yield-bearing vaults, making it compatible with other DeFi protocols and tools. The core `deposit`, `withdraw`, `mint`, `redeem`, `totalAssets`, `convertToShares`, `convertToAssets` functions are part of this standard.
2.  **Simulated Yield:** Instead of complex interactions with real external protocols (which require deep protocol knowledge, management of diverse assets, handling interest rate models, etc.), the contract *simulates* yield generation.
    *   `SimulatedStrategy` struct represents hypothetical investment pools with dynamic APYs and allocations.
    *   `addSimulatedStrategy`, `updateStrategyAPY`, `setStrategyAllocation` allow a manager to control these simulated parameters.
    *   Yield calculation (`_updateUserYield`, `calculateCurrentYield`) is done *per user* based on their principal, the elapsed time since their last interaction, and the current simulated average vault APY (weighted by strategy allocations), applying the yield boost and performance fee.
3.  **Simplified `totalAssets`:** A real ERC-4626 vault accrues yield by increasing the value of shares relative to the underlying asset. `totalAssets` reflects the total value (principal + earned yield) in the vault, and `convertToAssets` uses the `totalAssets / totalSupply` ratio (price per share). In this simulation, to keep the code manageable and focus on the user-specific yield and boost, `totalAssets` is simplified to roughly reflect the total principal, and the yield accrual is tracked separately in `pendingYield` per user. This is a significant deviation from standard ERC-4626 yield accounting but allows demonstrating other features.
4.  **Yield Boost NFT:**
    *   A separate (simulated) `IYieldBoostNFT` contract is assumed.
    *   `applyYieldBoost` allows users to "stake" a portion of their principal for a duration to receive a boost multiplier, represented by a call to `mint` on the NFT contract. The NFT contract is expected to store the boost parameters (multiplier, expiration) and potentially update dynamic metadata. The vault stores a reference to the active boost info for quick lookup during yield calculation.
    *   `removeYieldBoost` burns the NFT via a call to the NFT contract and removes the boost info from the vault. It includes a penalty simulation for early removal.
    *   `getBoostInfo` allows querying the active boost for a user.
5.  **Flash Withdrawal Fee:** A simple mechanism (`setFlashWithdrawFeeParams`, check in `_withdraw`/`_redeem`) to apply a small fee if a user withdraws assets shortly after depositing, a pattern sometimes used to mitigate risks related to flash loans interacting with vault mechanics (though less relevant in this specific simulation).
6.  **Yield Delegation:** `delegateYieldClaim` allows a user to grant another address the permission to call `claimYieldFor` on their behalf. The claimed yield still goes to the original user.
7.  **Performance Fee:** `setVaultPerformanceFee` allows setting a fee percentage on the earned yield, which is deducted before adding to the user's `pendingYield`. The collected fee amount is not explicitly managed in this simulation but could be sent to a treasury.
8.  **Access Control:** Uses a `vaultManager` role (set via `setVaultManager`) for sensitive configuration functions like strategy updates, fees, pause/shutdown, etc.
9.  **Safety:** Includes `ReentrancyGuard` and `paused`/`emergencyShutdownActive` states.
10. **Upgrade Signaling:** `signalUpgradeReadiness` is a simple, non-functional placeholder demonstrating the concept of signaling intent for future upgrade mechanisms (like proxy patterns), which are crucial for complex protocols.
11. **Historical Data:** A very basic simulation (`strategyAPYHistory`, `getHistoricalAPY`) of storing historical APY data. On-chain storage of extensive history is expensive; real applications use off-chain indexing.

This contract provides a rich set of interactions covering vault management, yield mechanics, user-specific boosts via NFTs, delegation, and safety features, demonstrating a creative combination of advanced concepts beyond a standard token or simple vault. Remember that the yield calculation and `totalAssets` are simulations and simplifications compared to a production-grade yield farming vault.
