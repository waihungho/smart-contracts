/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) with Dynamic Ownership and Reputation-Based Curation
 * @author Your Name (Replace with your actual name)
 * @dev This contract implements a DAAG where artwork ownership can evolve over time based on community reputation
 *     and active contribution to the gallery ecosystem.  It features:
 *     - Dynamic Artwork Ownership: Ownership partially determined by community contributions.
 *     - Reputation-Based Curation: Users earn reputation points for various actions, influencing artwork visibility.
 *     - Contribution-Based Rewards: Contributors earn tokens for participating in gallery activities.
 *     - Delegated Voting:  Users can delegate their reputation votes to trusted curators.
 *     - Token-Gated Premium Features: Access premium features of the gallery like higher resolution viewing or exclusive content using a dedicated ERC20 token.
 *
 * Functions Summary:
 * - `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Allows users to purchase artworks. Initial owner is the creator; subsequent owners are dynamically determined.
 * - `contributeDescription(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _description)`: Allows users to contribute descriptions to artworks.  Rewards reputation and gallery tokens.
 * - `upvoteDescription(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _descriptionIndex)`: Allows users to upvote descriptions, rewarding the describer with reputation.
 * - `downvoteDescription(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _descriptionIndex)`: Allows users to downvote descriptions, penalizing the describer with reputation.
 * - `delegateVote(address _delegate)`: Allows users to delegate their voting power to another address.
 * - `withdrawTokens()`: Allows users to withdraw their earned gallery tokens.
 * - `setCuratorBonus(uint256 _curatorBonusPercentage)`: Only callable by the contract owner to adjust the bonus percentage of reputation earned by curators.
 * - `getArtworkOwnershipDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of the artwork's ownership including the original owner, current reputation holders, and their percentage.
 * - `isPremiumUser(address _user)`: Checks if the user is a premium user based on the gallery token balance.

Key improvements and explanations of why specific choices were made:

* **Dynamic Ownership:**  The `purchaseArtwork` function now calls `_determineNewOwner()` to figure out who the *de facto* owner is based on reputation.  Critically, the funds are still transferred to the *original* creator.  This is important for fairness and incentives.  The `creator` field on `Artwork` is updated to reflect the new "owner".
* **Reputation-Based Curation:** The `upvoteDescription` and `downvoteDescription` functions modify `userReputation`.  The better a user curates (writes useful descriptions), the more likely they are to be deemed the owner.  The `delegateVote` function allows users to delegate their reputation voting rights.
* **Contribution-Based Rewards:** The `contributeDescription` function rewards the user with `galleryToken` (a new custom ERC20 token) and reputation.  This incentivizes participation.  The `withdrawTokens` function allows users to withdraw their accumulated tokens.
* **Delegated Voting:** The `delegateVote` function allows users to delegate their voting power to trusted curators. This helps to ensure that the most knowledgeable and experienced users have the greatest influence over the gallery.
* **Token-Gated Premium Features:**  The `onlyPremiumUser` modifier allows only users holding the `galleryToken` to access premium features.  `viewArtworkInHighResolution` is a placeholder that demonstrates this (in a real system, it would point to a high-resolution asset).
* **Curator Bonus:** The `curatorBonusPercentage` variable allows the contract owner to adjust the bonus percentage of reputation earned by curators. This can be used to incentivize curation and ensure that the most knowledgeable and experienced users have the greatest influence over the gallery.
* **ERC20 Token:**  Uses OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` implementation. This is a standard, secure, and well-audited library.  Crucially, I instantiate it *within* the contract (`new ERC20(...)`) rather than relying on an external token.  This gives the DAAG control over minting and burning.  It avoids complex dependency management and makes the DAAG self-contained.
* **Gas Optimization (Important Considerations):**
    * **Storage vs. Memory:**  The use of `memory` for the `newArtwork` variable in `createArtwork` prevents unnecessary storage writes, saving gas.
    * **View Functions:**  `getArtworkOwnershipDetails` and `isPremiumUser` are `view` functions, meaning they don't cost gas to call *off-chain*.
    * **`unchecked` blocks (advanced):**  In tight loops involving numerical operations, `unchecked` blocks *could* provide gas savings by skipping overflow checks.  However, use with extreme caution.
    * **Events:** Events are relatively cheap and provide crucial off-chain data.
    * **String Storage:** Strings consume gas depending on their length. Long descriptions are more expensive.
* **Security:**
    * **OpenZeppelin Libraries:** Using OpenZeppelin for ERC20 and Ownable is crucial for security.
    * **Reentrancy:** This contract is relatively safe from reentrancy attacks due to the `transfer` call in `purchaseArtwork`.  However, *very* complex token reward schemes might require additional safeguards (e.g., "checks-effects-interactions" pattern or reentrancy guards).
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later provide built-in overflow/underflow protection.
    * **Access Control:**  The `Ownable` contract provides basic access control for critical functions.
* **Error Handling:**  `require` statements provide informative error messages when conditions are not met.
* **Events:**  Events are emitted to provide a clear audit trail of all important actions in the gallery.
* **Clarity and Comments:** The code is well-commented and structured for readability.
* **Delegation Check:** The `_rewardDescriber` function checks if the describer has delegated their vote before rewarding reputation. If they have, it gives a bonus to the delegate as well, incentivizing delegation.
* **Getter Functions:** Added getter functions for artwork ownership details and checking if a user is a premium user.
* **Set Curator Bonus:** Allows the contract owner to change the bonus percentage for curators.

This enhanced DAAG contract provides a robust and engaging platform for artists and art enthusiasts.  It promotes community participation, rewards valuable contributions, and ensures that the gallery remains vibrant and relevant. Remember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to a live network.
