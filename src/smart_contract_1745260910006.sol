/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract representing a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery,
 * showcasing advanced concepts like dynamic NFT rental, fractional ownership,
 * community curation, algorithmic art generation incentives, and a decentralized
 * reputation system for artists and curators.

 * **Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **Core Art Management (NFTs):**
 * 1. `submitArtwork(string memory _artworkURI, uint256 _rentalPrice, uint256 _fractionalShares)`: Artists submit their artwork NFT URI, set rental price, and define fractional shares.
 * 2. `approveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators approve submitted artwork to be listed in the gallery.
 * 3. `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators reject submitted artwork.
 * 4. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _salePrice)`: Artists list their approved artwork for direct sale.
 * 5. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Users purchase artwork listed for sale.
 * 6. `rentArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _rentalPeriod)`: Users rent artwork for a specified period.
 * 7. `returnRentedArtwork(uint256 _rentalId)`: Renters return artwork after rental period.
 * 8. `createFractionalShares(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists finalize fractional share creation after artwork approval.
 * 9. `buyFractionalShare(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _sharesToBuy)`: Users buy fractional shares of an artwork.
 * 10. `redeemFractionalShareRevenue(uint256 _artworkId)`: Fractional share holders redeem accumulated revenue from rentals/sales.
 * 11. `removeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators can remove artwork from the gallery (e.g., policy violation).

 * **Community Curation & Governance:**
 * 12. `proposeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Existing curators propose a new curator.
 * 13. `voteForCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: Existing curators vote for or against a proposed curator.
 * 14. `setArtworkRentalFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: DAO (Curators/Community vote) sets a fee percentage on artwork rentals.
 * 15. `setArtworkSaleFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: DAO (Curators/Community vote) sets a fee percentage on artwork sales.

 * **Algorithmic Art Incentive & Reputation:**
 * 16. `generateAlgorithmicArt(string memory _prompt)`:  Users can trigger algorithmic art generation (hypothetical integration with an oracle/AI).
 * 17. `rewardAlgorithmicArtGenerator(uint256 _artworkId)`: Community can reward the generator of liked algorithmic art.
 * 18. `upvoteArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: Users can upvote artist reputation for quality artwork.
 * 19. `downvoteArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: Users can downvote artist reputation (with safeguards).
 * 20. `upvoteCuratorReputation(address _curatorAddress)`: Community can upvote curator reputation for good curation.
 * 21. `downvoteCuratorReputation(address _curatorAddress)`: Community can downvote curator reputation (with safeguards).
 * 22. `getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: View an artist's reputation score.
 * 23. `getCuratorReputation(address _curatorAddress)`: View a curator's reputation score.

 * **Gallery Management & Utilities:**
 * 24. `depositGalleryFunds()`: Users can deposit funds to the gallery's treasury for operational purposes or artist rewards.
 * 25. `withdrawGalleryFunds(uint256 _amount)`: Only DAO (Curators/Governance) can withdraw funds from the gallery treasury.
 * 26. `getGalleryBalance()`: View the current balance of the gallery's treasury.
 * 27. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Get detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 28. `getRentalDetails(uint256 _rentalId)`: Get details of a specific artwork rental.
 * 29. `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Trendy Functions:**

1.  **Dynamic NFT Rental:**  The `rentArtwork` and `returnRentedArtwork` functions enable users to rent NFTs for a specific period. This introduces a dynamic utility to NFTs beyond just ownership, aligning with the growing trend of NFT utility and access-based models.

2.  **Fractional Ownership:** The `createFractionalShares`, `buyFractionalShare`, and `redeemFractionalShareRevenue` functions implement a simplified version of fractional NFT ownership. This allows for collective ownership and democratization of high-value digital art, a significant trend in the NFT space. (Note: This is a simplified implementation; a real-world fractionalization would require more robust tokenization and revenue distribution mechanisms).

3.  **Community Curation (Simplified DAO):** The `proposeCurator`, `voteForCurator`, `setArtworkRentalFee`, and `setArtworkSaleFee` functions introduce elements of decentralized governance. While simplified to curator-based voting in this example, it demonstrates the concept of community control over gallery parameters, reflecting the DAO trend.

4.  **Algorithmic Art Incentive (Hypothetical):** The `generateAlgorithmicArt` and `rewardAlgorithmicArtGenerator` functions explore the integration of AI and algorithmic art within a smart contract. This is a forward-looking concept, hinting at future possibilities where smart contracts can interact with AI services and incentivize the creation of generative art. (Note: This is a conceptual function requiring off-chain oracle integration for actual AI art generation).

5.  **Decentralized Reputation System:** The `upvoteArtistReputation`, `downvoteArtistReputation`, `upvoteCuratorReputation`, `downvoteCuratorReputation`, `getArtistReputation`, and `getCuratorReputation` functions build a basic reputation system. This adds a layer of community-driven quality assessment for artists and curators, which is crucial for decentralized platforms and trust-building.

6.  **Gallery Treasury & Management:** Functions like `depositGalleryFunds`, `withdrawGalleryFunds`, and `getGalleryBalance` establish a basic gallery treasury. This allows for the accumulation and management of funds collected from fees or donations, enabling the gallery to be self-sustaining or fund community initiatives.

7.  **Function Richness (20+ Functions):** The contract intentionally includes a large number of functions to demonstrate a comprehensive set of features and meet the requirement of at least 20 functions. This showcases how a smart contract can be more than just a simple token or marketplace, encompassing a variety of functionalities.

**Important Considerations and Further Improvements (Beyond the scope of the request but important for real-world implementation):**

*   **ERC1155 for Fractional Shares:** For a real fractional ownership system, using ERC1155 tokens to represent fractional shares would be more efficient and standard.
*   **Revenue Distribution Logic:** The revenue distribution for fractional shares is simplified in this example. A more robust system would require tracking individual shareholder balances and implementing a fair distribution mechanism.
*   **Oracle Integration for Algorithmic Art:** The `generateAlgorithmicArt` function is a placeholder. Real integration with AI art generation requires using oracle services like Chainlink Functions or API3 to bridge the on-chain and off-chain worlds.
*   **Gas Optimization:** For a production-ready contract, significant gas optimization would be necessary, especially with the number of functions and state variables.
*   **Security Audits:**  Any smart contract dealing with value should undergo thorough security audits by reputable firms before deployment.
*   **Error Handling and Input Validation:** More comprehensive error handling and input validation should be implemented for robustness.
*   **Access Control:**  Fine-grained access control mechanisms can be further refined for different roles and actions within the gallery.
*   **UI/UX:**  A user-friendly front-end interface would be essential to interact with this smart contract and make the gallery accessible to users.

This contract provides a creative and advanced conceptual framework for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, showcasing a range of trendy blockchain concepts in a single smart contract. Remember that this is a conceptual example and would require further development, security audits, and potentially off-chain infrastructure for a production-ready application.
