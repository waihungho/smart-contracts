Okay, let's design a smart contract with a unique concept focusing on conditional, time-sensitive, and state-dependent actions triggered by external "observations." We'll call it the "Quantum Leap Relay," where "Leap Requests" exist in a kind of "superposition" until an "observation" event collapses them into a specific outcome. It's not a standard relay; it's about managing potential future actions based on triggers.

This design incorporates:
1.  **Superposition/Observation:** Actions have multiple potential outcomes until an external "observation signal" is provided.
2.  **Conditional Execution:** Outcomes depend on specific data within the observation *and* potentially other state/time conditions.
3.  **Time Decay:** Requests can expire and enter a "decayed" state if not observed in time.
4.  **Dynamic State:** Requests change states based on interactions.
5.  **Complex Configuration:** Requests can be configured with multiple potential actions and observation triggers.

It avoids standard patterns like ERC-20/721, simple voting, basic DeFi swaps, or standard multisigs.

---

### Outline:

1.  **Contract State:**
    *   Enums for Leap Request states (`SuperpositionState`).
    *   Structs for `OutcomeCondition`, `PotentialOutcome`, and `LeapRequest`.
    *   Mapping to store Leap Requests.
    *   Counters and ownership variables.
    *   Configuration variables (e.g., decay fee).
2.  **Access Control:**
    *   Owner for critical configuration and withdrawal.
    *   Requester for managing their own pending requests.
    *   Anyone can submit observations (if conditions met) or trigger decay.
3.  **Core Functionality:**
    *   Creating Leap Requests (`createLeapRequest`).
    *   Submitting observations to trigger state collapse (`submitObservation`).
    *   Executing the resolved action (`executeResolvedLeap`).
    *   Canceling requests (`cancelLeapRequest`).
    *   Triggering decay for expired requests (`decayStaleRequests`).
4.  **Configuration & Management:**
    *   Adding/removing/updating potential outcomes for pending requests.
    *   Updating request parameters (expiration, trigger).
    *   Setting contract-level parameters (decay fee).
    *   Withdrawing fees.
    *   Pausing (emergency).
5.  **View Functions:**
    *   Retrieving request details, state, outcomes, etc.
    *   Retrieving contract parameters.

### Function Summary:

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
2.  `createLeapRequest()`: Creates a new Leap Request in the `Pending` state with defined potential outcomes, observation trigger, and expiration.
3.  `submitObservation(uint256 leapId, bytes calldata observationData)`: Attempts to trigger the observation for a `Pending` request using provided data. If the data and conditions match a `PotentialOutcome`, the request state becomes `Observed`, and the specific outcome is recorded. Only callable if the request is `Pending` and within time.
4.  `executeResolvedLeap(uint256 leapId)`: Executes the action associated with the `ResolvedOutcome` for a request in the `Observed` state. Changes state to `Executed`.
5.  `cancelLeapRequest(uint256 leapId)`: Allows the original requester to cancel a request if it is still in the `Pending` state and not expired. Changes state to `Canceled`.
6.  `decayStaleRequests(uint256[] calldata leapIds)`: Allows anyone to mark multiple expired `Pending` requests as `Decayed`. Collects a small fee per decayed request (if configured).
7.  `addPotentialOutcome(uint256 leapId, OutcomeCondition memory condition, bytes calldata actionData, address targetAddress, uint256 value)`: Adds a new potential outcome to a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner).
8.  `removePotentialOutcome(uint256 leapId, uint256 outcomeIndex)`: Removes a potential outcome from a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner).
9.  `updateOutcomeCondition(uint256 leapId, uint256 outcomeIndex, OutcomeCondition memory newCondition)`: Updates the condition for a potential outcome in a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner).
10. `updateOutcomeAction(uint256 leapId, uint256 outcomeIndex, bytes calldata newActionData, address newTargetAddress, uint256 newValue)`: Updates the action data, target, or value for a potential outcome in a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner).
11. `updateExpiration(uint256 leapId, uint64 newExpiration)`: Updates the expiration timestamp for a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner).
12. `updateObservationTrigger(uint256 leapId, bytes32 newTriggerHash)`: Updates the expected trigger hash for a `Pending` request (only by requester or owner). (Note: `triggerHash` is a simplification; could be more complex trigger logic).
13. `transferLeapRequestOwnership(uint256 leapId, address newRequester)`: Transfers the rights to manage/cancel a `Pending` request to a new address (only by current requester or owner).
14. `setDecayFee(uint256 fee)`: Sets the fee amount collected when a request is decayed (only by owner).
15. `withdrawDecayFees(address payable recipient)`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated decay fees.
16. `pause()`: Pauses contract operations (emergency only, by owner). Prevents creation, observation, execution, decay. Cancellation might still be allowed based on logic.
17. `unpause()`: Unpauses contract operations (by owner).
18. `getLeapRequest(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get full details of a Leap Request (excluding sensitive `actionData`).
19. `getRequestState(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get the current state of a request.
20. `getPotentialOutcomes(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get the potential outcomes for a request (careful with gas if many outcomes). Excludes sensitive `actionData`.
21. `getResolvedOutcomeIndex(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get the index of the outcome that was resolved.
22. `getObservationDataHash(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get the hash of the data that triggered the observation (if in `Observed` state).
23. `getDecayFee()`: View function to get the current decay fee.
24. `getTotalLeapsCreated()`: View function for the total number of requests created.
25. `getRequester(uint256 leapId)`: View function to get the original requester of a leap.
26. `getContractBalance()`: View function to check contract's ether balance (includes decay fees and any ether sent with requests).
27. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard Ownable transfer.
28. `renounceOwnership()`: Standard Ownable renounce.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Superposition State & Observation Collapse:** The core idea is that a `LeapRequest` isn't a fixed action. It's a set of *potential* actions (`potentialOutcomes`) waiting for a specific "observation signal" (`submitObservation`). This models the quantum concept of a system existing in a superposition until observed. The `submitObservation` function acts as the "observer" that forces the state to collapse into one defined outcome based on the provided data and pre-set conditions.
2.  **Complex Conditional Logic:** The `OutcomeCondition` struct and the logic within `submitObservation` allow for flexible, on-chain *decision making* based on external data (`observationDataHash`) and internal state (`minimumTime`). This is more advanced than a simple boolean trigger. The first condition met determines the outcome, adding a layer of priority or uncertainty resolution.
3.  **Time Decay:** The `Decayed` state and `decayStaleRequests` function introduce a time-sensitive element. Requests don't last forever. If the "observation" doesn't happen by the expiration, the "quantum state" effectively decoheres or decays, making execution impossible and potentially resulting in lost value (any ETH sent with the request remains in the contract unless specifically handled for refund on decay, which isn't in this version for simplicity).
4.  **Dynamic Request Configuration:** Functions like `addPotentialOutcome`, `updateOutcomeCondition`, etc., allow the creator (or owner) to *modify* a request while it's still `Pending`. This means the set of potential futures for a "superpositioned" action can change over time, adding complexity and adaptability.
5.  **Role-Based Management:** The contract uses `Ownable` for critical admin tasks but also introduces the "requester" role for specific management of their individual pending requests, demonstrating nuanced access control beyond simple owner/public.
6.  **Generic Action Execution:** Using `address.call{value: ...}(calldata)` allows the `LeapRequest` outcomes to interact with *any* other contract or address, making it a flexible relay for conditional actions across the blockchain ecosystem.

This contract is significantly more complex than standard patterns and introduces a creative metaphor for managing conditional, time-bound, and data-triggered execution flows on the blockchain. It requires external systems (or manual calls) to provide the `observationData` and trigger execution, acting as a sophisticated orchestrator for future on-chain events.
