 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for managing a decentralized art collective.
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  **Contract Initialization & Management:**
 *     - `constructor(string _collectiveName, address _governanceTokenAddress)`: Initializes the DAAC with a name and governance token address.
 *     - `setCollectiveName(string _newName)`: Allows the contract owner to update the collective's name.
 *     - `setGovernanceTokenAddress(address _newTokenAddress)`: Allows the contract owner to update the governance token address.
 *     - `transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Allows the current owner to transfer contract ownership.
 *     - `renounceOwnership()`: Allows the current owner to renounce ownership, making the contract ownerless.
 *
 * 2.  **Membership Management:**
 *     - `applyForMembership(string memory _artistProfileURI)`: Artists can apply for membership by providing their profile URI.
 *     - `approveMembership(address _applicant)`: Only owner can approve membership applications.
 *     - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Only owner can revoke membership.
 *     - `isMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *     - `getMemberProfileURI(address _member)`: Retrieves the profile URI of a member.
 *
 * 3.  **Artwork Submission and Curation:**
 *     - `submitArtwork(string memory _artworkMetadataURI)`: Members can submit their artwork with metadata URI.
 *     - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 *     - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Gets the current curation status of an artwork (pending, approved, rejected).
 *     - `getArtworkMetadataURI(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves the metadata URI of an artwork.
 *     - `reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reportReason)`: Members can report artworks for policy violations.
 *
 * 4.  **Exhibition Management (Dynamic NFT Exhibition):**
 *     - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Creates a new exhibition with a name and time frame.
 *     - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds approved artworks to a specific exhibition.
 *     - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Starts an exhibition, making it active.
 *     - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends an exhibition, finalizing its state.
 *     - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of an exhibition.
 *
 * 5.  **Decentralized Governance & Reputation (Token-Gated Features):**
 *     - `proposeRuleChange(string memory _proposalDescription)`: Token holders can propose changes to collective rules (example: curation threshold).
 *     - `voteOnRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Token holders can vote on rule change proposals.
 *     - `executeRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a rule change proposal if it passes governance voting.
 *     - `awardReputationPoints(address _member, uint256 _points)`: Owner can award reputation points to members for contributions.
 *     - `viewMemberReputation(address _member)`: Allows viewing a member's reputation points.
 *
 * 6.  **Advanced & Creative Functionality (Dynamic NFT Traits & Collaborative Art):**
 *     - `collaborateOnArtwork(uint256 _baseArtworkId, string memory _collaborativeElementURI)`: Members can collaborate on existing approved artworks by adding elements (e.g., remixing).
 *     - `getCollaborativeVersions(uint256 _baseArtworkId)`: Retrieves a list of collaborative versions of a base artwork.
 *     - `evolveArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _evolutionMetadataURI)`:  Allows artwork evolution based on community feedback or time (dynamic NFT traits).
 *     - `triggerDynamicTraitUpdate(uint256 _artworkId)`:  (Internal/Owner controlled) Triggers an update to dynamic NFT traits for an artwork based on predefined logic (external data source integration possible).
 *
 * 7.  **Utility & Information Functions:**
 *     - `getCollectiveName()`: Returns the name of the art collective.
 *     - `getGovernanceTokenAddress()`: Returns the address of the governance token.
 *     - `getArtworkCount()`: Returns the total number of artworks submitted.
 *     - `getExhibitionCount()`: Returns the total number of exhibitions created.
