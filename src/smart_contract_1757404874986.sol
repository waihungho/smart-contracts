This smart contract, "AetherMind DAO," introduces a unique and advanced concept: a Decentralized Autonomous Organization dedicated to fostering, managing, and evolving on-chain generative intellectual property (IP). It integrates a simulated AI oracle ("AetherMind") to provide creative guidance and proposal evaluation, and utilizes a sophisticated reputation-based governance system powered by Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to determine member influence.

The DAO's core mission is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for generative art, music, or other digital assets. It allows for community-driven evolution of creative algorithms and a robust framework for licensing its generated output, positioning the AI not just as a decision-support tool, but as a co-creative agent within the DAO.

---

## OUTLINE:

1.  **Core DAO Governance:**
    *   Proposal creation, voting (weighted by AetherReputation), and execution mechanisms.
    *   Delegation and revocation of AetherReputation voting power.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of governance parameters (proposal threshold, voting period, execution delay).

2.  **AetherReputation (Soulbound Tokens - SBTs):**
    *   Custom non-transferable tokens representing reputation and achievements.
    *   SBTs directly influence voting power, proposal submission rights, and AetherMind query access.
    *   Ability for DAO to mint, burn, and dynamically update the voting weight of different badge types.

3.  **AetherMind Oracle Integration:**
    *   Interface for submitting complex, structured queries to a designated AI oracle (simulated for this contract, expected to be an off-chain service).
    *   Mechanism for the oracle to asynchronously return creative suggestions, evaluations, or data, which can then be used in proposals or IP generation.
    *   DAO governance over the trusted oracle contract address.

4.  **Generative IP Management:**
    *   A registry for different generative algorithms (identified by content hashes, potentially linking to IPFS CIDs of code or specifications).
    *   A system for members to request new generative outputs, explicitly allowing for guidance from previous AetherMind responses.
    *   On-chain metadata management for generated IP assets.
    *   A robust licensing framework for DAO-owned IP, allowing for terms and fee collection.

5.  **DAO Treasury:**
    *   A secure vault for managing funds contributed to or earned by the DAO.
    *   Governed withdrawal mechanisms for approved initiatives, IP development, or operational costs.

## FUNCTION SUMMARY:

### I. Governance & Proposals

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the DAO with its creator as the initial owner and sets up base parameters.
2.  `propose(bytes memory _callData, string memory _description)`: Allows members with sufficient AetherReputation to create a new generic governance proposal.
3.  `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote (for/against) on a specified proposal, with voting power directly derived from the member's aggregated AetherReputation score.
4.  `delegate(address _delegatee)`: Allows a member to delegate their total AetherReputation voting power to another address.
5.  `revokeDelegation()`: Revokes any active voting power delegation, returning voting power to the caller.
6.  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has passed voting and cleared its timelock period.
7.  `setProposalThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: Allows DAO governance to adjust the minimum total AetherReputation required to create new proposals.
8.  `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newPeriod)`: Allows DAO governance to adjust the duration (in blocks) for which proposals can be voted on.
9.  `setExecutionDelay(uint256 _newDelay)`: Allows DAO governance to adjust the timelock delay (in blocks) before a passed proposal can be executed.

### II. AetherReputation (SBT) Management

10. `mintReputationBadge(address _to, uint256 _badgeId, uint256 _amount)`: Mints a new quantity of a specific AetherReputation badge (SBT) to an address. Only callable by the DAO itself or approved admins.
11. `burnReputationBadge(address _from, uint256 _badgeId, uint256 _amount)`: Burns a quantity of a specific AetherReputation badge from an address, reducing their reputation. Only callable by the DAO or approved admins.
12. `getReputationWeight(address _member)`: Calculates and returns the total AetherReputation score for a member, summing up all their owned badges weighted by `badgeWeights`.
13. `updateBadgeWeight(uint256 _badgeId, uint256 _newWeight)`: Allows DAO governance to update the voting weight multiplier associated with a specific type of AetherReputation badge.

### III. AetherMind Oracle Interaction

14. `submitAetherMindQuery(string memory _queryContext, bytes memory _parameters)`: Allows members (with sufficient reputation) to submit a new, complex query to the AetherMind oracle for creative input or evaluation. Returns a unique `queryId`.
15. `receiveAetherMindResponse(uint256 _queryId, string memory _responseHash, bytes memory _data)`: Records the asynchronous response from the AetherMind oracle for a given query. This function is restricted to the designated AetherMind oracle address.
16. `getAetherMindQueryStatus(uint256 _queryId)`: Retrieves the current status, and if available, the response details for a specific AetherMind query.
17. `setAetherMindOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Allows DAO governance to update the trusted contract address for the AetherMind oracle.

### IV. Generative IP Management

18. `registerGenerativeAlgorithm(bytes32 _algoHash, string memory _name, string memory _description)`: Registers a new generative algorithm (identified by a hash, e.g., IPFS CID of its code/spec) for use and evolution by the DAO.
19. `updateGenerativeAlgorithm(bytes32 _oldAlgoHash, bytes32 _newAlgoHash, string memory _description)`: Allows DAO governance to update the details or hash of an existing generative algorithm, enabling iterative improvements or "mutations."
20. `requestGenerativeOutput(bytes32 _algoHash, uint256 _aetherMindQueryId, bytes memory _inputParams, string memory _metadataURI)`: Requests the creation of a new IP asset using a registered algorithm. This can optionally incorporate a specific AetherMind query's response as guidance, and stores the IP's metadata URI.
21. `licenseGenerativeIP(uint256 _ipId, address _licensee, uint256 _feeAmount, uint256 _termEndTimestamp, string memory _licenseURI)`: Grants a specific license for a piece of DAO-owned generative IP to a licensee, defining terms like fees and duration. Only callable by DAO governance.
22. `collectLicenseFee(uint256 _ipId, address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows an authorized party (e.g., a keeper after DAO approval) to mark a license fee as collected for a specific IP, moving funds into the DAO treasury.

### V. DAO Treasury

23. `depositFunds()`: A fallback function that allows anyone to send Ether (ETH) directly to the DAO treasury.
24. `withdrawFunds(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows DAO governance to propose and execute withdrawals of funds (ETH) from the treasury to a specified address.
