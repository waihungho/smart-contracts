Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Quantum Vault". This contract aims to be creative and advanced by introducing dynamic access control based on an internal "Quantum State", simulated external Oracle data, non-transferable NFTs as "keys", and a simple trust score mechanism. It integrates elements often found separately or in simpler forms.

It has significantly more than 20 functions and tries to combine several concepts in a unique way. It doesn't replicate a standard ERC-4626 vault, basic ERC-20/ERC-721, or typical multi-sig/timelock contracts.

Outline:
1.  Contract Description: Quantum Vault for ERC-20 tokens with dynamic access control.
2.  Core Concepts:
    -   ERC-20 Token Vault.
    -   Dynamic Access Rules: Deposit/Withdraw conditions change based on Quantum State.
    -   Quantum State: An internal state variable influencing rules, changeable by Owner or Oracle prediction.
    -   Oracle Integration (Simulated): Contract can request/receive external data influencing State.
    -   Quantum Key NFT (ERC-721): Non-transferable NFT issued on first deposit, required for certain actions.
    -   Trust Score: An internal score managed by owner, affecting access.
3.  Data Structures: Enums for State, Structs for State configuration, Mappings for user data (balances, NFT IDs, trust scores, unlock times).
4.  Events: For key actions (Deposit, Withdraw, State Change, Oracle Request/Fulfill, Trust Score Update).
5.  Functions:
    -   Core Vault Operations (Deposit, Withdraw, Balances)
    -   NFT Management (Minting, Checking Ownership/ID)
    -   Quantum State Management (Set State, Get State, Configuration)
    -   Oracle Integration (Request, Fulfill, Get Prediction)
    -   Dynamic Access Rule Checks (Can Deposit, Can Withdraw, Get Current Rules)
    -   Trust Score Management (Set, Get)
    -   Utility & Admin (Pause, Unpause, Emergency Withdraw, Version)

Function Summary:

-   Core Vault Operations:
    -   `deposit(uint256 amount)`: Deposits ERC-20 tokens into the vault, potentially minting a Quantum Key NFT.
    -   `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Withdraws ERC-20 tokens, subject to current state rules and user conditions.
    -   `getUserBalance(address user)`: View user's deposited balance.
    -   `getTotalDeposited()`: View total ERC-20 tokens held in the vault (excluding potential yield/external gains).
    -   `getVaultToken()`: View the address of the ERC-20 token managed by the vault.

-   NFT Management (Quantum Key ERC-721 - Simplified/Internal):
    -   `mintQuantumKey(address user)`: Internal function to mint a non-transferable NFT for a user.
    -   `getQuantumKeyId(address user)`: View the Quantum Key NFT ID held by a user (0 if none).
    -   `isQuantumKeyHolder(address user)`: Check if a user holds a Quantum Key NFT.
    -   `ownerOfQuantumKey(uint256 tokenId)`: View the owner of a given Quantum Key NFT ID (emulates ERC-721 ownerOf).
    -   `getTotalQuantumKeysMinted()`: View the total number of Quantum Key NFTs minted.

-   Quantum State Management:
    -   `setQuantumState(QuantumState newState)`: Owner sets the contract's operational state.
    -   `getQuantumState()`: View the current Quantum State.
    -   `configureState(QuantumState state, StateConfig memory config)`: Owner configures rules for a specific state.
    -   `getStateConfig(QuantumState state)`: View the configuration for a specific state.

-   Oracle Integration (Simulated):
    -   `requestOraclePrediction(bytes calldata data)`: Owner requests data from a simulated Oracle.
    -   `fulfillOraclePrediction(bytes32 requestId, bytes calldata data)`: Callback function (only callable by designated Oracle address) to fulfill a prediction request.
    -   `getLatestPredictionResult()`: View the latest data received from the Oracle.
    -   `updateStateBasedOnPrediction()`: Owner or designated admin triggers state change based on the latest prediction result and configured rules.

-   Dynamic Access Rule Checks:
    -   `canDeposit(address user, uint256 amount)`: View function to check if a deposit is currently allowed for a user and amount under the current state rules.
    -   `canWithdraw(address user, uint256 amount)`: View function to check if a withdrawal is currently allowed for a user and amount under the current state rules, considering time locks, trust score, and NFT.
    -   `getWithdrawalUnlockTime(address user)`: View the timestamp when a user's deposited funds become eligible for withdrawal based on initial lock.
    -   `getEffectiveWithdrawalLimit(address user)`: View the maximum amount a user can withdraw in the current state and conditions.

-   Trust Score Management:
    -   `setTrustScore(address user, uint256 score)`: Owner sets a user's trust score.
    -   `getTrustScore(address user)`: View a user's trust score.

-   Utility & Admin:
    -   `pause()`: Owner pauses contract operations.
    -   `unpause()`: Owner unpauses contract operations.
    -   `emergencyWithdrawToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Owner can withdraw stuck arbitrary tokens (not the vault token).
    -   `getVersion()`: View contract version.
    -   `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: Owner sets the address of the trusted Oracle contract.
    -   `getOracleAddress()`: View the current Oracle address.
    -   `getPausedStatus()`: View current pause status.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic Quantum State:** The contract's behavior (deposit/withdrawal rules) changes based on the `currentQuantumState`. This allows the owner or external factors (via Oracle) to dramatically alter how the vault operates. This is more complex than simple pausing or fixed time locks.
2.  **State-Specific Configuration:** Each `QuantumState` has its own detailed `StateConfig` struct. This makes the state changes powerful, as they can simultaneously affect minimums, maximums, lock durations, NFT requirements, and trust score requirements.
3.  **Simulated Oracle Influence:** The contract includes functions (`requestOraclePrediction`, `fulfillOraclePrediction`) that *simulate* interaction with an external Oracle. While the actual Oracle logic isn't in this contract (it would be a separate contract calling `fulfillOraclePrediction`), the structure is there for state transitions to be potentially triggered or influenced by external data feeds (like market conditions, real-world events, or even AI predictions delivered by the Oracle). The `oraclePredictionRule` in `StateConfig` is a placeholder for encoding how the state should react to specific predictions.
4.  **Quantum Key NFT (Internal, Non-Transferable):** Users receive a unique, non-transferable ERC-721 NFT upon their *first* deposit. This NFT acts as a dynamic "key" or "membership card". Certain `QuantumState` configurations can *require* holding this NFT to deposit or withdraw, adding a layer of access control beyond simple address checks or balances. It also marks the user's history with the vault.
5.  **Internal Trust Score:** An owner-managed `userTrustScore` mapping introduces a reputation-like system. State configurations can require a minimum trust score for participation, allowing the vault owner/community (in a DAO extension) to curate access based on predefined criteria.
6.  **Layered Access Control:** Deposit and withdrawal checks (`canDeposit`, `canWithdraw`) combine multiple conditions simultaneously: the current state's rules, the user's balance, their withdrawal unlock time (based on deposit history and state locks), their Quantum Key NFT status, and their Trust Score. This creates a highly granular and dynamic access system.
7.  **Separation of Concerns (Sort Of):** While it's a single contract, it logically separates core vault logic, state management, NFT tracking, Oracle interaction, and access rules.

This contract goes beyond typical examples by weaving together several distinct mechanisms (state machines, Oracle patterns, NFTs for access, custom scores) into a single, dynamically controlled vault.
