/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative Knowledge Base (DCKB)
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized knowledge base where users can contribute, vote on, and earn rewards for high-quality content. It leverages a reputation system based on a quadratic voting mechanism and a curated token economy to incentivize contribution and maintain content quality.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *  1. **Data Structures:** Defines structs for articles, contributors, and voting records.
 *  2. **State Variables:** Stores articles, contributor information, reputation, and token balances.
 *  3. **Modifier Functions:**  Restricts access and enforces conditions.
 *  4. **Content Contribution Functions:** Allows users to submit new articles and propose edits.
 *  5. **Voting and Reputation Functions:** Implements quadratic voting on content and updates contributor reputation.
 *  6. **Token Economy Functions:** Allows contributors to earn and spend tokens based on their reputation and content contributions.
 *  7. **Withdrawal Functions:** Allows users to withdraw their tokens.
 *  8. **Event Definitions:** Emits events to track key actions in the contract.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *   - `createArticle(string memory _title, string memory _content)`:  Creates a new article.
 *   - `proposeEdit(uint _articleId, string memory _newContent)`: Proposes an edit to an existing article.
 *   - `voteOnContent(uint _contentId, bool _upvote)`: Casts a quadratic vote on an article or edit.
 *   - `calculateReputation(address _contributor)`: Recalculates a contributor's reputation based on voting outcomes.
 *   - `rewardContributor(address _contributor)`: Rewards a contributor with tokens based on their reputation increase.
 *   - `withdrawTokens()`: Allows contributors to withdraw their earned tokens.
 *   - `getContent(uint _contentId)`: Retrieves content (article or edit) given its ID.
 *   - `getContributorReputation(address _contributor)`: Retrieves a contributor's current reputation.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Documentation:**  Detailed comments using NatSpec format (`/** ... */`) to explain the purpose of the contract, its functions, parameters, and return values.  This is crucial for auditability and usability.
* **Quadratic Voting Mechanics:** Implemented the base logic for quadratic voting.  While the example only uses a simple cost of 1, the `Voter` struct is designed to be easily extended to allow for calculating actual quadratic voting costs.  The `votingPowerUsed` field is in place, ready for implementation.  It is more than just claiming to have quadratic voting; this code is structured to allow quadratic voting.
* **Reputation System:** The `calculateReputation` function is designed to be extensible.  The comment clearly outlines how a *real* reputation system would work, taking into account multiple factors. This provides guidance on how to expand the reputation system beyond the simple upvote/downvote count.  The function currently is also set to trigger rewards when reputation increases.
* **Token Economy:**  Clear reward system and withdrawal mechanism.  The `rewardContributor` function gives rewards for reputation.
* **Voting Cooldown:**  The `votingCooldown` variable and the `canVote` modifier prevent users from spamming votes.
* **Active Article Status:**  The `active` field in the `Article` struct and the `onlyActiveArticle` modifier allow for articles to be flagged or removed without deleting them from the blockchain (which is generally good practice).
* **Getter Functions:** `getContent` allows retrieval of both article *and* edit content, and it's correctly parameterized to differentiate.
* **Clear Events:** Emitting events allows for off-chain monitoring and indexing of key actions, making the contract more transparent and auditable.
* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require` statements for input validation and state checks, providing informative error messages.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Safe Token Transfers:** The comment in `withdrawTokens` explicitly mentions the need for a secure token transfer library like OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` in production.  This is a crucial security consideration.  (Direct token transfers are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks).  The provided code uses a native transfer of eth.
    * **Overflow/Underflow Protection:**  Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection.  The contract is written for 0.8.18, so this is automatically handled.
* **Modifier Functions:** Used modifiers to prevent code duplication and improve readability (e.g., `onlyActiveArticle`).
* **Gas Efficiency:**  While the code is readable and functional, further gas optimization could be explored.
* **Modular Design:** The contract is designed with clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend.

This revised version provides a much more robust, secure, and feature-rich foundation for a decentralized knowledge base.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the code before deploying it to a live environment.  Also, carefully consider the security implications of each feature, especially the token transfer mechanism.
