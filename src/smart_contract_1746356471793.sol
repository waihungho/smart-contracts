Okay, let's design an advanced, creative, and unique smart contract. We'll build a **"ChronosDAO"**, a decentralized autonomous organization focused on **managing resources and making decisions based on predictions about future events and incorporating time-sensitive mechanisms.**

This isn't just a standard treasury DAO. It combines elements of:
1.  **Time-Locked Governance/Resources:** Certain actions or funds are only accessible after specific times or conditions.
2.  **Internal Prediction Market:** Members can stake governance tokens on the outcome of registered future events or even the outcome of proposals themselves.
3.  **Time-Weighted Reputation/Influence:** Member influence is not just based on static token balance but also on participation over time and accuracy of predictions.
4.  **Conditional Execution:** Proposals can be set up to execute only if certain conditions (including prediction outcomes) are met *at the time of execution*.

This design aims to be creative by linking governance directly to forecasting and temporal dynamics, going beyond simple token-weighted voting and treasury management.

## ChronosDAO Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Description:** A DAO focused on time-sensitive governance, future prediction, and dynamic influence based on participation and prediction accuracy.
2.  **State Variables:** Define key parameters, counters, mappings for proposals, predictions, votes, reputation, and time locks.
3.  **Structs:** Define data structures for `Proposal`, `PredictionEvent`, `VoteInfo`.
4.  **Events:** Log important actions like proposal creation, voting, prediction registration/resolution, treasury updates, reputation changes, etc.
5.  **Modifiers:** Access control (`onlyOwner`, `onlyOracle`), temporal checks (`whenTreasuryUnlocked`, `whenFutureFunctionUnlocked`).
6.  **Interfaces:** Define necessary interfaces for external contracts (e.g., ERC20, Oracle).
7.  **Constructor:** Initialize core parameters and addresses.
8.  **Core DAO Functions:** Proposing, Voting, Execution, Cancellation.
9.  **Time-Lock Functions:** Setting, checking, and triggering time locks.
10. **Prediction Market Functions:** Registering events, submitting predictions, resolving outcomes, claiming rewards.
11. **Reputation System Functions:** Querying reputation, internal updates based on actions.
12. **Treasury Management Functions:** Deposit, check balance. Withdrawal handled via proposals.
13. **Parameter Management:** Functions to update DAO parameters (governance-controlled).
14. **Query Functions:** Read-only functions to get contract state.

**Function Summary (> 20 functions):**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract with core addresses and parameters.
2.  `propose`: Allows a member to create a new governance proposal. Includes options for calldata execution and linking to a prediction outcome.
3.  `vote`: Allows a member to cast a vote (Yes, No, Abstain) on an active proposal. Voting power considers token balance and reputation.
4.  `execute`: Attempts to execute a passed proposal. Checks vote outcome, quorum, timing, and *optionally* a linked prediction outcome.
5.  `cancelProposal`: Allows the proposer or owner to cancel a proposal before the voting period ends.
6.  `getProposalState`: Returns the current state of a specific proposal (Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed, Executed, Canceled).
7.  `getProposalVoteInfo`: Returns the current vote counts for a specific proposal.
8.  `getVotingPower`: Calculates the effective voting power for an address based on token balance and reputation.
9.  `registerPredictionEvent`: Allows a designated role (e.g., Owner or via Proposal) to register a future event for prediction.
10. `submitPrediction`: Allows a member to stake governance tokens on one of the possible outcomes for a registered prediction event.
11. `resolvePredictionEvent`: Called by the trusted oracle to set the final outcome for a registered prediction event after it occurs.
12. `claimPredictionRewards`: Allows members who predicted correctly for a resolved event to claim their share of the staked pool.
13. `getPredictionState`: Returns the state of a specific prediction event (Registered, Resolved).
14. `getPredictionOutcome`: Returns the resolved outcome of a prediction event.
15. `getUserPredictionStake`: Returns the staking details (amount, chosen outcome) for a user on a specific prediction event.
16. `depositTreasury`: Allows users or other contracts to send governance tokens to the DAO treasury.
17. `getTreasuryBalance`: Returns the current balance of governance tokens held by the DAO treasury.
18. `setTimeLockDuration`: Allows governance (via proposal) to update the duration for certain contract-level time locks.
19. `triggerTreasuryTimeLock`: Applies a time lock to the treasury based on the configured duration. Can only be called after the *previous* lock expires.
20. `checkTreasuryTimeLockStatus`: Returns true if the treasury time lock has expired.
21. `triggerFutureFunctionTimeLock`: Applies a time lock to a specific, potentially powerful, future function.
22. `checkFutureFunctionTimeLockStatus`: Returns true if the future function time lock has expired.
23. `getUserReputation`: Returns the current reputation score for an address.
24. `updateOracleAddress`: Allows governance (via proposal) to update the trusted oracle address.
25. `setQuorumParameters`: Allows governance (via proposal) to update the quorum requirement for proposals.
26. `setVotingPeriod`: Allows governance (via proposal) to update the duration of the voting period.
27. `_updateReputation`: (Internal) Helper function to adjust user reputation based on actions (e.g., successful votes, correct predictions).
28. `_handlePredictionRewards`: (Internal) Helper function to calculate and transfer prediction rewards.
29. `_executeProposal`: (Internal) Helper function to safely execute proposal calldata.

**Explanation of Creative/Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Prediction-Dependent Execution:** Proposals can be linked to prediction events. A proposal might pass voting but *only* execute if a specific external event (resolved via the oracle) has a certain outcome. This allows the DAO to prepare for potential future states or make decisions contingent on verifiable external facts (e.g., "If market price drops below X by date Y, execute emergency treasury transfer Z").
2.  **Time-Weighted Reputation/Influence:** Voting power isn't just a snapshot of token balance. The `userReputation` score, increased by positive participation like voting or correct predictions, adds a layer of persistent influence. `getVotingPower` combines tokens and reputation, incentivizing long-term, accurate engagement over simple token holding.
3.  **Internal Prediction Market Integration:** The contract isn't just a user of external oracles; it *hosts* internal prediction events where members can stake governance tokens. This creates a mechanism for collective forecasting and rewards accurate predictions directly within the DAO's economic layer. Incorrect stakes contribute to the reward pool for correct predictors.
4.  **Dynamic Time-Locks:** The contract includes explicit time lock variables (`treasuryUnlockedAt`, `futureFunctionUnlockedAt`) and functions to *trigger* these locks based on a configurable `timeLockDuration`. This allows governance (or specific events) to proactively lock certain capabilities for a set period, adding a layer of temporal control over sensitive operations, independent of proposal voting periods.
5.  **Modular Parameter Updates via Governance:** Key parameters like `votingPeriod`, `quorumNumerator`, `quorumDenominator`, and even the `oracleAddress` can be updated, but only through successful governance proposals (or owner for initial setup/emergency). This makes the DAO adaptable over time.
6.  **Distinct Treasury Address:** By designating a separate `treasuryAddress`, the contract structure encourages placing funds in a dedicated, potentially multi-sig or specialized, contract, enhancing security and separation of concerns compared to holding all funds directly in the DAO logic contract.

**Limitations and Considerations (as with any complex contract):**

*   **Oracle Dependency:** The prediction system relies heavily on a trusted oracle providing timely and accurate resolutions.
*   **Complexity:** Managing proposals, votes, predictions, reputation, and time locks in one contract is complex and increases the surface area for potential bugs. Rigorous auditing is essential.
*   **Gas Costs:** Complex proposal executions or large numbers of prediction stakers could incur significant gas costs.
*   **Scalability:** Storing all vote and prediction stake details on-chain might become expensive with a large number of users or events. Off-chain voting or alternative scaling solutions might be needed for a high-throughput DAO.
*   **Reputation System:** The current reputation system is simple addition. More advanced systems might include decay, different weights for different actions, or checks against Sybil attacks.
*   **Proposal Execution Safety:** The `_executeProposal` function uses a low-level `call`. While standard in DAOs, care must be taken regarding re-entrancy if the target contract is untrusted. State changes should ideally happen *before* the call. (In this code, state updates like `proposal.executed = true` occur before the `_executeProposal` call).

This contract provides a foundation for a ChronosDAO, demonstrating how time, prediction, and reputation can be integrated into governance mechanisms in a creative and advanced way.
