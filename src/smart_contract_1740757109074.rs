/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Ownership & Governance
 * @author Your Name (Replace with your actual name or pseudonym)
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO for owning and governing an AI model. It allows members to propose and vote on model updates, usage policies, and even licensing strategies. The contract uses quadratic voting to weight votes proportionally to their conviction.  It also introduces a novel "AI Model Reputation Score" that dynamically adjusts member voting power based on their past proposal success.
 *
 * @dev This contract incorporates advanced concepts:
 *      - Quadratic Voting: Prevents wealthy members from dominating decision-making.
 *      - Dynamic Voting Power: Rewards members with successful proposals.
 *      - AI Model Version Control: Manages different versions of the underlying AI model data.
 *      - Delegated Voting: Allows members to delegate their votes to other members.
 *      - AI Model Reputation Score: Track the success of the member proposal and calculate reputation score accordingly.

**Outline:**

*   **`AIModelGovernanceDAO`**: The main contract implementing the DAO.

**Function Summary:**

*   **`constructor(string _modelName, uint256 _votingDuration, uint256 _quorumPercentage)`**:  Initializes the DAO with the AI model name, voting duration, and quorum percentage.  It also adds the contract deployer as the first member with an initial reputation score.
*   **`joinDAO()`**: Allows anyone to request membership.  (In a real application, this would likely be more permissioned.)
*   **`leaveDAO()`**: Allows members to leave the DAO, removing their voting power and reputation. Requires members to have no active votes.
*   **`createProposal(string _description, int256 _reputationImpact)`**: Creates a new proposal for changes to the AI model or governance rules. The reputation impact value is used to adjust the proposer's reputation score based on the success of the proposal.
*   **`vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _inFavor, uint256 _votePower)`**: Allows a member to cast their vote on a proposal, using a percentage of their voting power. This implements the quadratic voting mechanism.
*   **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes a proposal after the voting period, checking if the quorum has been met.  Updates the AI model version or governance rules based on the proposal's outcome. Adjusts the reputation of the proposer based on the proposal's success (approved or rejected).
*   **`deployNewModelVersion(string _modelURI, string _metadataURI)`**: Deploys a new version of the AI model, storing the URI and metadata.
*   **`getCurrentModelVersion()`**: Returns the current AI model version.
*   **`delegateVote(address _delegate)`**: Allows a member to delegate their voting power to another member (implements delegated voting). The delegate must meet a minimum reputation threshold.
*   **`revokeDelegation()`**: Allows a member to revoke their vote delegation.
*   **`updateVotingPower(address _member)`**:  Updates the voting power of a member based on their reputation and delegation status.
*   **`updateAllVotingPower()`**:  Updates the voting power for all the members.
*   **`setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`**:  (Owner-only) Sets the voting duration for proposals.
*   **`setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`**: (Owner-only) Sets the quorum percentage required for proposals to pass.
*   **`withdrawEther()`**: (Owner-only) Withdraws any accidentally sent Ether to the contract.
*   **`receive()`**: prevents accidentally sent ERC20 or Ether to the contract.
*   **`onlyMember()`**: Modifier that restricts access to functions to members only.
*   **`onlyValidProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Modifier that checks if a proposal ID is valid.
*   **`onlyDuringVoting(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Modifier that restricts access to functions to the voting period of a proposal.
*   **`onlyBeforeExecution(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Modifier that restricts access to functions to before a proposal is executed.
*   **`onlyAfterVoting(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Modifier that restricts access to functions to after a proposal voting period is over.

**Key Features and Concepts:**

*   **DAO for AI Model Governance:** This contract provides a framework for a decentralized community to govern an AI model.
*   **AI Model Version Control:** The contract includes functionality to manage different versions of the AI model data.
*   **Quadratic Voting:** Although a simplified implementation is used in the `vote` function, the intent is to use `_votePower` as a percentage of voting power *applied*, which can be adjusted based on the user's holdings/votes.
*   **Dynamic Voting Power (AI Model Reputation Score):**  The `memberReputation` and subsequent calculation of `votingPower` creates a system where members who propose successful changes gain more influence, while those who propose unsuccessful changes lose influence. This encourages high-quality proposals and active participation.
*   **Delegated Voting:** Allows members to delegate their votes to trusted members, increasing participation and potentially improving decision-making.
*   **Gas Optimization:** The implementation prioritizes clarity and demonstration of the core concepts. In a production environment, consider gas optimization strategies such as caching frequently accessed data and reducing storage writes.
*   **Reputation system**: A reputation system is introduced to reward members with successful proposals and penalize those with unsuccessful proposals, influencing their voting power.
*   **Security Considerations**: The contract currently lacks strong security measures. A production-ready contract would need thorough auditing, input validation, access control, and safeguards against common attacks like reentrancy. The handling of external URIs should be carefully reviewed.

**How to Improve (Future Enhancements):**

*   **Advanced Quadratic Voting:** Implement a more precise quadratic voting algorithm (e.g., using square root calculations).
*   **Security Audits:**  Thoroughly audit the contract for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Implement gas optimization strategies.
*   **Token-based Membership:** Integrate a token for membership and voting power.  This could be an ERC20 or ERC721 token.
*   **Decentralized Storage:** Use decentralized storage solutions like IPFS or Filecoin to store AI model data and metadata.
*   **Voting Weight Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism for voting weights to discourage long-term hoarding of voting power.
*   **More Sophisticated Reputation System:** Implement a more detailed and robust reputation system that considers factors like proposal quality, participation in discussions, and code contributions.
*    **External Oracle Integration**: Integrate external oracles to verify data or trigger actions based on real-world events, such as AI model performance metrics.
*   **Upgradeability:** Implement a proxy pattern for upgradeability, allowing for future improvements to the contract logic without breaking existing functionality.
*   **AI Model Licensing:**  Integrate features for managing AI model licensing agreements and revenue distribution.
*   **Data Privacy:** Implement mechanisms to ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.

This contract provides a solid foundation for building a truly decentralized and community-governed AI model ecosystem. Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
