This smart contract, named "EchelonReputationGovernor," aims to create a highly dynamic and adaptive decentralized reputation system. It blends several advanced and trendy concepts:

*   **Dynamic, Decayable Reputation:** User reputation scores are not static but change based on activity, staking, and naturally decay over time.
*   **Soulbound Attestations (SBT-like):** Non-transferable tokens representing verifiable credentials, achievements, or roles. These are linked to reputation.
*   **ZK-Proof Integration (Conceptual):** The contract supports the storage of commitment hashes and verification proof hashes, allowing for privacy-preserving attestations where users can prove facts without revealing underlying data, and the contract can conceptually verify the proof's validity hash.
*   **Adaptive Governance:** Voting power in proposals is directly tied to a user's effective reputation, which includes staked boosts and delegated power. Proposal thresholds can dynamically adjust.
*   **Dynamic Economic Layer:** Transaction fees and potential rewards can adapt based on a user's reputation, offering discounts to high-reputation users or increasing costs for low-reputation ones.
*   **Delegated Reputation:** Users can delegate their reputation power to others, enabling more flexible governance participation.
*   **On-chain Dispute Resolution:** A mechanism for users to challenge reputation changes, with resolution by designated arbitrators or the governance system.
*   **Gamification & Anomaly Detection:** Reputation tiers (implicit) and direct penalties for flagged malicious behavior.

This contract does not duplicate existing open-source projects but rather synthesizes and innovates upon various cutting-edge ideas in a unified system.

## Smart Contract: EchelonReputationGovernor

This contract orchestrates a dynamic, multi-faceted reputation and adaptive governance system.

### Outline

**I. Core Reputation System (Dynamic & Decayable)**
*   Manages individual user reputation scores, which naturally decay over time.
*   Allows for administrative adjustments and flagging of malicious activities.

**II. Reputation Augmentation & Delegation**
*   Enables users to stake tokens to boost their reputation.
*   Facilitates delegation of reputation power for governance participation.

**III. Soulbound Attestations (Verifiable Credentials)**
*   Provides a framework for issuing, revoking, and verifying non-transferable (soulbound) attestations or credentials.
*   Supports privacy-preserving claims using commitment hashes and conceptual ZK-proof verification.

**IV. Adaptive Governance & Access Control**
*   Implements a proposal and voting system where voting power is derived from effective reputation.
*   Features dynamically adjusting proposal thresholds and role-based access based on reputation and attestations.

**V. Dynamic Economic Layer**
*   Introduces adaptive transaction fees that provide discounts or premiums based on user reputation.
*   Allows for distribution of rewards to highly reputable users.

**VI. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration**
*   Provides a formal mechanism for users to challenge reputation changes.
*   Facilitates a process for arbitrators or governance to resolve these disputes.

**VII. Administrative & Configuration**
*   Functions for contract owner to set global parameters, manage authorized issuers, and resolve disputes.

### Function Summary

**I. Core Reputation System**
1.  `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _rateNumerator, uint256 _rateDenominator)`: Sets the global decay rate for user reputation.
2.  `getRawReputationScore(address _user)`: Retrieves a user's current raw reputation score after applying decay.
3.  `decayReputationForUser(address _user)`: Explicitly triggers reputation decay for a specific user (can be called by anyone to update state).
4.  `updateReputation(address _user, int256 _amount)`: Adjusts a user's reputation score (admin/privileged).
5.  `flagAndPenalize(address _user, int256 _penaltyAmount, bytes32 _reasonHash)`: Flags a user for malicious activity and applies a reputation penalty (admin/privileged).
6.  `getTotalUserReputation()`: Returns the sum of all raw, decayed reputations (expensive, for monitoring).

**II. Reputation Augmentation & Delegation**
7.  `stakeForReputationBoost(uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to stake a specified amount of tokens to boost their reputation.
8.  `unstakeReputationBoost(uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to unstake a specified amount of tokens, reducing their reputation boost.
9.  `delegateReputationPower(address _delegatee)`: Delegates the caller's effective reputation power to another address.
10. `undelegateReputationPower()`: Revokes any existing reputation delegation by the caller.
11. `getEffectiveReputationPower(address _user)`: Calculates the total reputation power for a user, including raw, staked, and delegated power from others.

**III. Soulbound Attestations**
12. `issueAttestation(address _recipient, bytes32 _attestationTypeHash, bytes32 _commitmentHash, uint256 _expiresAt)`: Issues a new, non-transferable attestation to a recipient, potentially with a privacy-preserving commitment.
13. `revokeAttestation(bytes32 _attestationId)`: Revokes an existing attestation, rendering it invalid (by issuer or governance).
14. `revealAttestationCommitment(bytes32 _attestationId, bytes memory _revealedData, bytes32 _proofHash)`: Allows an attestation recipient to reveal data behind a commitment and potentially verify an associated ZK-proof hash, impacting reputation.
15. `getAttestationDetails(bytes32 _attestationId)`: Retrieves the details of a specific attestation.
16. `isAttestationValid(bytes32 _attestationId)`: Checks if a given attestation is currently active and unrevoked.
17. `addAuthorizedIssuer(address _issuerAddress, bytes32[] calldata _allowedAttestationTypes)`: Grants an address permission to issue specific types of attestations.

**IV. Adaptive Governance & Access Control**
18. `submitProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _reputationThreshold)`: Allows users to submit governance proposals, specifying required reputation.
19. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a reputation-weighted vote on an active proposal.
20. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully passed proposal.
21. `getDynamicProposalThreshold()`: Calculates a dynamically adjusted minimum reputation required to submit a proposal, based on system health.
22. `checkRoleAccess(address _user, bytes32 _requiredAccessRole)`: Verifies if a user has sufficient reputation or specific attestations for a given access role.

**V. Dynamic Economic Layer**
23. `setReputationDiscountFactor(uint256 _factorNumerator, uint256 _factorDenominator)`: Sets parameters for how reputation influences transaction fees.
24. `calculateDynamicFee(address _user, uint256 _baseAmount)`: Calculates the actual fee for a user, dynamically adjusted by their reputation.
25. `distributeReputationRewards()`: Distributes a portion of accumulated fees or rewards to high-reputation users (callable by governance/admin).

**VI. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration**
26. `challengeReputation(address _targetUser, int256 _proposedAdjustment, string memory _reasonHash)`: Initiates a dispute to challenge a reputation change for a user.
27. `voteOnDispute(uint256 _disputeId, bool _approveAdjustment)`: Arbitrators (or governance) vote on the proposed adjustment in a dispute.
28. `resolveDispute(uint256 _disputeId)`: Concludes a dispute, applying the voted adjustment to the target user's reputation.
