 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery.
 * It features advanced concepts like DAO governance, dynamic artwork pricing based on popularity,
 * community curation, artist residencies, and on-chain exhibitions.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Contract: ArtGalleryGovernanceToken (ERC20 - Separate Contract, assumed deployed)**
 *   - Standard ERC20 functions (transfer, approve, balanceOf, etc.)
 *   - Used for governance voting and potentially staking within the DAAG.
 *
 * **Contract: DecentralizedArtGallery**
 *
 * **Core Functions (Artwork Management):**
 *   1. `mintArtwork(string memory _metadataURI, address _artist, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows authorized minters (initially owner, later governed) to mint new artworks as NFTs.
 *   2. `setArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows the artist or authorized roles to update artwork metadata.
 *   3. `transferArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address _to)`: Standard NFT transfer function, allows artwork owners to transfer their NFTs.
 *   4. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Allows artwork owners to list their artworks for sale in the gallery.
 *   5. `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows anyone to buy listed artworks.
 *   6. `cancelArtworkListing(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the artwork owner to cancel a listing.
 *   7. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns detailed information about a specific artwork (metadata URI, artist, owner, price, popularity score, etc.).
 *   8. `burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows authorized roles (governed) to burn an artwork NFT, potentially for curation purposes or in rare circumstances.
 *
 * **Governance and DAO Functions:**
 *   9. `setGovernanceTokenContract(address _governanceTokenContract)`:  Owner function to set the address of the governance token contract.
 *   10. `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes memory _data)`: Allows governance token holders to create proposals for gallery changes (e.g., new curators, fee changes, artwork acquisition, new features).
 *   11. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on active proposals.
 *   12. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows anyone to execute a passed proposal after the voting period.
 *   13. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details about a specific governance proposal (description, status, votes, etc.).
 *   14. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _votingPeriod)`: Owner/governance function to change the default voting period for proposals.
 *   15. `setQuorum(uint256 _quorum)`: Owner/governance function to change the quorum required for proposals to pass (percentage of total governance tokens needed to vote yes).
 *
 * **Curatorial and Community Functions:**
 *   16. `submitArtworkProposalForGallery(string memory _metadataURI, address _artist)`: Allows artists to submit their artworks for consideration to be featured in the gallery (not minting, just proposing).
 *   17. `voteOnArtworkProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on submitted artwork proposals.
 *   18. `acceptArtworkProposalIntoGallery(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Function to mint and add an accepted artwork proposal to the gallery, triggered after proposal passes.
 *   19. `donateToGallery()`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the gallery to support operations and artist residencies.
 *   20. `withdrawGalleryDonations(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`:  Governance function to withdraw donations from the gallery treasury.
 *   21. `scheduleExhibition(string memory _exhibitionTitle, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, uint256[] memory _artworkIds)`:  Governance function to schedule on-chain exhibitions, associating a set of artworks with a specific time period and title.
 *   22. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`:  Returns details of a scheduled exhibition.
 *
 * **Artist Residency Functions (Example - can be expanded):**
 *   23. `createArtistResidencyProposal(string memory _artistStatement, uint256 _durationInDays, uint256 _fundingAmount)`: Governance proposal to create an artist residency opportunity.
 *   24. `applyForArtistResidency(uint256 _residencyProposalId, string memory _portfolioLink)`: Allows artists to apply for approved residency programs.
 *   25. `selectResidentArtist(uint256 _residencyProposalId, address _artistAddress)`: Governance function to select an artist for a residency after applications are reviewed.
 *
 * **Utility/Admin Functions:**
 *   26. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Owner/governance function to set a platform fee percentage on artwork sales.
 *   27. `setPlatformFeeRecipient(address _recipient)`: Owner/governance function to set the address to receive platform fees.
 *   28. `pauseContract()`: Owner function to pause core contract functionalities in case of emergency.
 *   29. `unpauseContract()`: Owner function to unpause the contract.
 *   30. `setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI)`: Owner function to set the base URI for artwork metadata.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Trendy Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Governance:**
    *   The contract incorporates a basic DAO structure using a separate governance token (assumed to be an ERC20 token deployed elsewhere).
    *   **Governance Token Voting:**  Governance token holders can create and vote on proposals, giving them control over the gallery's parameters and operations.
    *   **Proposal Types:**  `ProposalType` enum allows for different categories of proposals (fee changes, curator appointments, new features, artwork acquisition, artist residencies), making governance more structured.
    *   **Voting Process:**  Proposals have a voting period, quorum requirement, and vote counting.
    *   **Proposal Execution:**  If a proposal passes, it can be executed, and the contract logic implements example actions for different proposal types.

2.  **Community Curation of Artworks:**
    *   `submitArtworkProposalForGallery` and `voteOnArtworkProposal` functions enable a community-driven curation process. Artists can submit their artworks, and governance token holders can vote to accept them into the gallery.
    *   This decentralizes the selection of art, moving away from a centralized authority.

3.  **Artist Residencies (Example):**
    *   Functions like `createArtistResidencyProposal`, `applyForArtistResidency`, and `selectResidentArtist` outline a basic framework for managing on-chain artist residency programs.
    *   This is a trendy concept in the NFT and art world, enabling decentralized patronage and support for artists.

4.  **On-Chain Exhibitions:**
    *   `scheduleExhibition` and `getExhibitionDetails` allow for the creation and management of on-chain exhibitions within the smart contract.
    *   While the actual visual display of the exhibition would likely be off-chain (e.g., on a website that reads the contract data), the scheduling and artwork association happen on-chain, making it transparent and verifiable.

5.  **Dynamic Pricing (Popularity Score - Placeholder):**
    *   The `Artwork` struct includes a `popularityScore` field.  While the actual logic for updating this score is not implemented (it would require external data or on-chain activity tracking), it's a placeholder for a trendy concept.
    *   In a real application, you could design mechanisms to increase/decrease artwork prices based on community engagement, views, secondary market activity, etc., making pricing more dynamic and potentially fairer.

6.  **Donations and Gallery Treasury:**
    *   `donateToGallery` and `withdrawGalleryDonations` functions create a basic gallery treasury funded by community donations.
    *   This allows for decentralized funding of the gallery's operations and artist support.

7.  **Platform Fees and Revenue Sharing:**
    *   The contract implements a platform fee on artwork sales, which can be set and adjusted via governance.
    *   This fee can be used to sustain the gallery, reward curators (if implemented), or fund other community initiatives.

8.  **Pause/Unpause Functionality:**
    *   `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` provide an emergency mechanism to pause core contract functionalities in case of security vulnerabilities or critical issues.

**Key Improvements and Further Development:**

*   **Governance Token Contract Implementation:** You would need to deploy a separate ERC20 governance token contract and set its address in the `DecentralizedArtGallery` contract.
*   **Curator Roles and Permissions:** Implement roles for curators and governance mechanisms for appointing/removing them. Curators could have specific permissions (e.g., artwork approval, exhibition management).
*   **Advanced Royalty Mechanisms:**  Implement more sophisticated royalty splits for artists on primary and secondary sales.
*   **Popularity Score Logic:** Develop and implement the logic for dynamically updating the `popularityScore` of artworks based on on-chain or off-chain data.
*   **Artist Residency Management:** Expand the artist residency functions to include application review, selection processes (potentially using voting), funding disbursement, and residency tracking.
*   **Off-Chain Integration:** Design the contract to be easily integrated with off-chain platforms (websites, metaverse spaces) to display artworks, exhibitions, and governance information.
*   **Security Audits:**  Before deploying to a production environment, thoroughly audit the contract for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Review and optimize the contract for gas efficiency to reduce transaction costs for users.

This smart contract provides a solid foundation for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery with many trendy and advanced features. You can build upon this and customize it further to create a unique and innovative platform.
