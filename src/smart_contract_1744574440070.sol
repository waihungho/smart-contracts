/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) that allows artists to collaborate, create, curate, and monetize digital art.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `applyForMembership()`: Artists can apply to become members of the DAAC.
 *    - `voteOnMembershipApplication(address _applicant, bool _approve)`: Existing members vote to approve or reject membership applications.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Curator can revoke membership for violating rules (governance vote in future iterations).
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the total number of members in the DAAC.
 *    - `isMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAAC.
 *
 * **2. Art Proposal & Creation:**
 *    - `proposeArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Members can propose new digital artworks for the collective, specifying collaborators and IPFS hash.
 *    - `voteOnArtworkProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on artwork proposals.
 *    - `finalizeArtworkCreation(uint256 _proposalId)`: If a proposal passes, curator (or automatic timer) finalizes the artwork creation, minting an NFT representing collective ownership.
 *    - `getArtworkProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork proposal.
 *    - `getArtworkCount()`: Returns the total number of artworks created by the DAAC.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork.
 *
 * **3. Curation & Exhibition:**
 *    - `nominateArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _artworkId)`: Members can nominate artworks from the DAAC collection for exhibition.
 *    - `voteOnExhibitionNomination(uint256 _nominationId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on which nominated artworks should be exhibited.
 *    - `setExhibitionSchedule(uint256[] memory _artworkIds, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Curator sets up an exhibition schedule with selected artworks and time frame.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitionArtworks()`: Returns a list of artworks currently in exhibition.
 *    - `getCurrentExhibitionDetails()`: Retrieves details of the current active exhibition (if any).
 *
 * **4. Revenue & Treasury Management:**
 *    - `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal function called after artwork finalization) Mints an NFT representing the artwork and sends it to the DAAC treasury.
 *    - `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Curator can list DAAC-owned artworks for sale in a primary or secondary marketplace (external integration needed).
 *    - `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`:  (Simulated purchase within the contract - in real-world, this would be triggered by marketplace events or oracles).
 *    - `depositToTreasury() payable`: Members or external parties can deposit funds (ETH/tokens) into the DAAC treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Curator can withdraw funds from the treasury for DAAC operational costs or artist payouts (governance vote in future iterations).
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the DAAC treasury.
 *
 * **5. Governance & Parameters:**
 *    - `setCurator(address _newCurator)`:  Allows the current curator to transfer curatorship to a new address (governance vote in future iterations).
 *    - `getCurator()`: Returns the address of the current curator.
 *    - `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Curator can set the voting period for proposals (governance vote in future iterations).
 *    - `getVotingPeriod()`: Returns the current voting period.
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Curator can pause the contract in case of emergency or critical updates.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Curator can unpause the contract.
 *    - `isContractPaused()`: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
