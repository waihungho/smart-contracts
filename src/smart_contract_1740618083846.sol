/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative Storytelling (StoryChain)
 * @dev This contract allows users to collaboratively create a story, one sentence at a time.
 *      It incorporates several advanced concepts:
 *      - **NFT as Story Fragment:** Each submitted sentence is represented as an NFT.
 *      - **Dynamic NFT Metadata:** The NFT's metadata (title, description, image) evolves as the story grows.
 *      - **DAO-Governed Content Moderation:** Proposals are created to moderate potentially offensive or off-topic sentences.
 *      - **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC):**  Contributors are rewarded with reputation points based on approval scores.
 *      - **Linear Bounties for specific contributions:**  Bounties can be placed on certain missing aspects of the story
 *
 * @author Gemini

 *  - `getStoryNFTMetadata(uint256 _storyId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the NFT metadata for a sentence in a story.
 *  - `reputation(address _contributor)`: Returns the reputation score of a contributor.
 *  - `placeBounty(uint256 _storyId, string memory _description, uint256 _reward)`:  Places a bounty on a specific missing part of the story.

Key improvements and explanations of the code:

* **Detailed Outline and Function Summary:** The top of the code now has a comprehensive summary of the contract's functionality. This is best practice for complex contracts.

* **NFT as Story Fragment:** Each sentence is conceptually an NFT. The `getStoryNFTMetadata` function simulates the retrieval of metadata for these NFTs.  Crucially, it constructs a JSON representation that includes not just the sentence itself, but also *context* from the overall story description. This makes the "NFT" more valuable.  A real implementation would store the JSON off-chain (e.g., IPFS) and return a URI.  The function now properly formats the JSON, including author and timestamp, and adds a placeholder image.

* **Dynamic NFT Metadata:** The story's `description` field is dynamically updated as new sentences are added.  `contributeToStory` now updates this description to contain the last few sentences of the story, giving context to the sentence NFTs.  This makes the NFT metadata *evolve* over time.

* **DAO-Governed Content Moderation:** The `submitModerationProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, and `executeProposal` functions enable community-based moderation.  A `MODERATION_THRESHOLD` controls the voting percentage needed for a proposal to pass.  Authors of moderated sentences have their reputation penalized.

* **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC):** The `reputation` mapping tracks the reputation of contributors.  Reputation is awarded for creating stories, adding sentences, and voting on proposals. It's penalized for submitting bad proposals and for having sentences moderated.  The system encourages high-quality contributions.

* **Linear Bounties:**  The `placeBounty` and `claimBounty` functions allow users to place bounties for specific missing parts of the story or desired contributions.  Bounties are paid out in Ether when a suitable sentence is submitted.  Extra ether that's passed into the `placeBounty` function is correctly refunded.  Story creators cannot create linear bounties until the story has exceeded the `MINIMUM_STORY_LENGTH`

* **Error Handling:**  The code now includes more `require` statements to validate inputs and prevent errors.  Modifiers are used to simplify checks.

* **Events:** Events are emitted to track key actions in the contract, allowing external applications to monitor the story's progress.

* **Gas Optimization:**  The string concatenation in `contributeToStory` is done using `abi.encodePacked` which is generally more gas-efficient than repeated string appending.

* **Security:** The code includes basic checks to prevent reentrancy vulnerabilities (although more complex logic might require more sophisticated protection).

* **Helper Library:** The `Strings` library is included for converting `uint256` and `address` values to strings, which are needed for the NFT metadata.

* **Contract Balance and Ether Handling:**
    * `contractBalance()` function added to check the contract's current Ether balance.
    * `receive()` function added to allow the contract to receive Ether, which is necessary for the bounty system.

* **Thorough Comments:** The code is heavily commented to explain each step and the reasoning behind it.

How to deploy and test (basic outline):

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Use Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy the `StoryChain` contract to a test network (e.g., Ganache, Goerli).
2.  **Create a Story:** Call `createNewStory` to start a new story.
3.  **Contribute:** Call `contributeToStory` multiple times to add sentences to the story.
4.  **Moderate:** Call `submitModerationProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, and `executeProposal` to test the moderation system.
5.  **Check Reputation:** Call `reputation` to see how reputation scores change.
6.  **Place and Claim Bounties:** Call `placeBounty` (sending Ether along with it) and then `claimBounty` to test the bounty system.
7.  **Inspect NFT Metadata:**  Call `getStoryNFTMetadata` and examine the returned JSON.

This improved version provides a more complete and functional implementation of the decentralized collaborative storytelling concept. It's designed to be more robust, secure, and user-friendly.  Remember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
