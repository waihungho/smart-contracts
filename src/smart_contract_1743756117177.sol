 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A Smart Contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * This contract allows artists to submit their artwork proposals, community members to vote on them,
 * and approved artworks to be minted as unique Art Tokens. It incorporates advanced concepts
 * like dynamic royalties, collaborative art creation, decentralized exhibitions, and reputation-based governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 *   1. `joinCollective(string _artistName)`: Allows users to become members of the collective by paying a membership fee.
 *   2. `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective, potentially with partial membership fee refund.
 *   3. `setMembershipFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Allows the governor to set a new membership fee. (Governor controlled)
 *   4. `proposeNewGovernor(address _newGovernor)`: Allows the current governor to propose a new governor, subject to community vote. (Governor controlled proposal)
 *   5. `voteOnGovernorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on governor proposals.
 *   6. `executeGovernorProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governor proposal (e.g., changing governor). (Governor controlled execution after vote)
 *   7. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 *   8. `getMembershipStatus(address _member)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *
 * **Art Submission & Approval:**
 *   9. `submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to submit art proposals with title, description, and IPFS hash.
 *   10. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on art proposals.
 *   11. `mintArtToken(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints an Art Token for an approved art proposal, only executable after proposal passes. (Governor or designated minter)
 *   12. `rejectArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Rejects an art proposal, only executable after proposal fails. (Governor or designated rejector)
 *   13. `getArtProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of an art proposal.
 *   14. `getApprovedArtTokenCount()`: Returns the total number of approved Art Tokens minted.
 *
 * **Art Token & Royalties:**
 *   15. `transferArtToken(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`: Transfers ownership of an Art Token.
 *   16. `setArtTokenMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string _newMetadata)`: Allows the original artist to update the metadata of their Art Token. (Artist controlled metadata update)
 *   17. `getArtTokenMetadata(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the metadata of an Art Token.
 *   18. `setDynamicRoyaltyRate(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newRate)`: Allows the original artist to set a dynamic royalty rate for their Art Token (percentage of secondary sales).
 *   19. `getDynamicRoyaltyRate(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the dynamic royalty rate for an Art Token.
 *
 * **Collective Treasury & Exhibitions:**
 *   20. `depositToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective's treasury.
 *   21. `withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: Allows the governor to withdraw ETH from the treasury for collective purposes (subject to governance in future iterations). (Governor controlled withdrawal)
 *   22. `createDecentralizedExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256[] _tokenIds)`: Allows the governor to create a decentralized exhibition featuring selected Art Tokens. (Governor controlled exhibition creation)
 *   23. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a decentralized exhibition.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 *   - **Dynamic Royalties:** Artists can set and adjust royalty rates for their Art Tokens, encouraging secondary market activity while rewarding creators.
 *   - **Reputation-Based Governance (Implicit):** Membership itself acts as a basic reputation system, as members are entrusted with voting power. Future iterations could expand this with on-chain reputation scores.
 *   - **Decentralized Exhibitions:** Concept of creating curated digital exhibitions directly within the smart contract, showcasing the collective's artwork.
 *   - **Governor Election/Change Proposal:** Decentralized mechanism to change the governor through community vote, enhancing DAO aspects.
 *
 * **Note:** This is a conceptual smart contract and might require further development, security audits, and gas optimization for production use.
