Okay, let's design and implement a smart contract with advanced concepts, focusing on a "Decentralized Adaptive Strategy Vault" (DASV). This contract will allow users to deposit funds, have those funds notionally allocated across different "strategy slots" with dynamically changing weights, and participate in a governance process to influence these weights and other parameters. It incorporates elements of dynamic state, community influence, and simulated performance tracking for reward distribution.

This contract design aims to be creative and avoids direct duplication of common open-source protocols like standard ERC-20/721, basic vaults, simple voting, or AMMs.

**Outline and Function Summary: Decentralized Adaptive Strategy Vault (DASV)**

**Concept:**
The DASV is a community-driven fund where users deposit ERC-20 tokens. The deposited funds are not directly invested by the contract but are conceptually allocated across various "Strategy Slots." Each slot has a dynamically adjusted weight (percentage of total allocation) and a simulated performance factor. Users earn rewards based on their deposit amount, the total value locked (TVL), the current dynamic strategy allocations, and the simulated performance of those strategies. A built-in governance system allows token holders (or staked participants) to propose and vote on changes to strategy allocations and key contract parameters.

**Core Features:**
1.  **Dynamic Allocation:** Strategy slot weights change over time or via governance.
2.  **Simulated Performance:** Strategy slot performance is simulated and updated (e.g., by an admin or oracle feed in a real system).
3.  **Reward Distribution:** Rewards accrue based on user deposits and the weighted simulated performance of strategies.
4.  **Governance:** Users can propose and vote on allocation changes and parameter updates.
5.  **Influence Staking:** Users stake tokens to gain voting power and potentially earn governance rewards.
6.  **Adaptive Parameters:** Key contract parameters can be adjusted via governance.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Contract owner (for initial setup and emergencies).
*   `depositToken`: Address of the ERC-20 token users deposit.
*   `tvl`: Total Value Locked in the vault.
*   `strategySlotCounter`: Counter for unique strategy slot IDs.
*   `strategySlots`: Mapping of slot ID to StrategySlot struct.
*   `strategySlotIds`: Array of active strategy slot IDs.
*   `totalAllocationWeight`: Sum of current weights for all strategy slots (should ideally sum to a fixed base, e.g., 10000).
*   `userDeposits`: Mapping of user address to their deposit amount.
*   `userAccruedRewards`: Mapping of user address to pending rewards.
*   `userLastRewardCalculationTime`: Mapping of user address to timestamp of last reward calculation.

    *   `isActive`: Flag indicating if the slot is active.

*   `Proposal`: Represents a governance proposal.
    *   `id`: Unique ID.
    *   `proposer`: Address who created the proposal.
    *   `proposalType`: Type of proposal (e.g., 1=AllocationChange, 2=ParameterChange).
    *   `targetStrategyId`: Relevant for AllocationChange proposals.
    *   `newAllocationWeight`: Relevant for AllocationChange proposals.
    *   `parameterName`: Relevant for ParameterChange proposals (e.g., "minDepositAmount").
    *   `newParameterValue`: Relevant for ParameterChange proposals.
    *   `description`: Short description of the proposal.
    *   `voteStartTime`: Timestamp when voting begins.
    *   `voteEndTime`: Timestamp when voting ends.
    *   `votesFor`: Total influence stake voted "Yes".

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic State & Adaptive Behavior:** The allocation weights (`currentAllocationWeight`) and performance factors (`simulatedPerformanceFactor`) are not fixed but change over time, either through admin updates (simulating oracle/strategy performance feeds) or via governance. This makes the contract's behavior dynamic based on external factors or community input.
2.  **Simulated Performance & Accrual:** Instead of directly managing investments (which is complex and high-gas), the contract *simulates* strategy performance. Rewards are calculated based on this *simulated* performance applied proportionally across user deposits and allocated strategies. The reward calculation accrues over time based on deposit amount and the *current* weighted performance. This pattern is used in some DeFi yield protocols but simplified here.
3.  **In-Contract Governance:** The contract includes a built-in governance system to propose and execute changes to core parameters (allocations, thresholds, durations, rates). This is more complex than simple multi-sig or token-weighted polling, incorporating proposal lifecycle, voting periods, quorum, and execution logic directly on-chain.
4.  **Influence Staking:** The voting power isn't just based on a token balance snapshot but requires users to actively `stakeInfluence` tokens. This locks up assets, signaling commitment and preventing drive-by voting from temporary token holders.
5.  **Parameter Governance:** Not only strategy allocations but also core operational parameters (`minDepositAmount`, `voteQuorumPercent`, `votingPeriodDuration`, `rewardRateBasisPoints`) can be adjusted via the governance process. This makes the contract highly configurable and adaptable over time based on community consensus, without needing redeployment (for these specific parameters).

**Limitations and Potential Improvements (for a production system):**

*   **Simulated Performance:** A real system would integrate with oracles or external adapters to get actual performance data from yield farms, lending protocols, etc.
*   **Reward Calculation Precision:** The simple time-based accrual based on *current* state can have minor precision issues or be gas-intensive if called frequently. A more advanced system might use checkpoints, snapshots, or a more complex continuous accrual mechanism (like Compound's JumpRateModel or similar).
*   **Total Allocation Weight:** The current design for `addStrategySlot` and `proposeAllocationChange` doesn't automatically ensure `totalAllocationWeight` for *active* slots sums exactly to 10000. Governance proposals for allocation changes would ideally propose a full set of weights that sum correctly, or there would be a separate normalization mechanism.
*   **Gas Efficiency:** The `_calculatePendingRewards` loop over `strategySlotIds` can become gas-expensive if there are many strategy slots.
*   **Security:** This is a complex contract with many state interactions. It would require extensive testing and auditing (reentrancy, unexpected state changes, access control bugs, integer overflows/underflows though mitigated by Solidity 0.8+).
*   **Reward Token:** Rewards are currently simulated as deposit tokens. A real system might issue a separate reward token or use actual yield generated elsewhere. The current `claimRewards` function doesn't actually transfer tokens due to the simulation aspect, it only emits an event.
*   **Governance Complexity:** The current governance is basic (single vote per address with staked weight, simple quorum/majority). Real DAOs use quadratic voting, delegation, representative systems, etc.
*   **Parameter Change Validation:** Parameter changes (`proposeParameterChange`) have basic name validation but no validation on the *values* (e.g., preventing setting quorum to 200%).

This contract provides a solid framework demonstrating the requested advanced concepts and features, meeting the function count requirement without directly copying existing major protocols.
