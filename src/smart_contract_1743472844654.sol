/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative AI Model Training DAO
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant - based on user request)
 * @dev A Smart Contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on
 *      collaborative AI model training. This contract allows members to contribute data,
 *      train models collaboratively, propose improvements, vote on proposals, and get rewarded
 *      for their contributions. It aims to incentivize and manage a decentralized AI training
 *      ecosystem.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **DAO Management & Membership:**
 * 1. initializeDAO(string _daoName, uint256 _minStake): Initializes the DAO with name and minimum stake.
 * 2. joinDAO(): Allows users to join the DAO by staking tokens.
 * 3. leaveDAO(): Allows members to leave the DAO and unstake tokens.
 * 4. getDAOMembers(): Returns a list of current DAO members.
 * 5. getMemberStake(address _member): Returns the stake amount of a member.
 * 6. setMinimumStake(uint256 _newStake): Allows DAO owner to change the minimum stake requirement.
 * 7. pauseDAO(): Allows DAO owner to pause certain functionalities for emergency.
 * 8. unpauseDAO(): Allows DAO owner to resume paused functionalities.
 *
 * **Data Contribution & Management:**
 * 9. contributeData(string _dataHash, string _dataDescription): Allows members to contribute data with hash and description.
 * 10. getDataContributionDetails(uint256 _contributionId): Retrieves details of a specific data contribution.
 * 11. getAllDataContributions(): Returns a list of all data contribution IDs.
 * 12. proposeDataDeletion(uint256 _contributionId, string _reason): Allows members to propose deletion of a data contribution.
 *
 * **Model Training & Evaluation:**
 * 13. startTrainingRound(string _roundDescription, uint256 _deadline): Starts a new model training round with description and deadline.
 * 14. submitModel(uint256 _roundId, string _modelHash, string _modelDescription): Allows members to submit trained models for a round.
 * 15. evaluateModel(uint256 _roundId, uint256 _modelSubmissionId, uint256 _evaluationScore): Allows DAO owner (or designated evaluator) to evaluate submitted models.
 * 16. selectWinningModel(uint256 _roundId, uint256 _winningModelId): Allows DAO owner to select the winning model for a round.
 * 17. getTrainingRoundDetails(uint256 _roundId): Retrieves details of a specific training round.
 * 18. getModelSubmissionDetails(uint256 _roundId, uint256 _modelSubmissionId): Retrieves details of a specific model submission.
 *
 * **Proposal & Voting System:**
 * 19. createProposal(string _proposalDescription, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes _proposalData): Allows members to create proposals.
 * 20. voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support): Allows members to vote on proposals.
 * 21. executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a passed proposal.
 * 22. getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific proposal.
 * 23. getActiveProposals(): Returns a list of active proposal IDs.
 *
 * **Rewards & Incentives (Conceptual - Token integration needed for real rewards):**
 * 24. distributeRoundRewards(uint256 _roundId): (Conceptual) Distributes rewards to contributors and winning model submitter.
 * 25. claimRewards(): (Conceptual) Allows members to claim their earned rewards.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Collaborative AI Model Training DAO:** The core concept itself is advanced and trendy. It combines the power of DAOs with the growing field of AI, addressing the need for decentralized and collaborative AI model development.

2.  **Data Contribution and Management:**
    *   **`contributeData()` and `getDataContributionDetails()`:** Allows members to contribute data with a hash (representing off-chain data storage like IPFS) and description. This is a crucial function for building a dataset collaboratively.
    *   **`proposeDataDeletion()`:** Introduces a governance aspect to data management. If data is found to be problematic (e.g., low quality, biased, or violating privacy), members can propose its deletion through a voting process. This addresses data quality control in a decentralized setting.

3.  **Model Training Rounds:**
    *   **`startTrainingRound()`:**  Organizes the model training process into rounds, each with a description and deadline. This structures the collaborative effort.
    *   **`submitModel()`:** Members can submit their trained models for a specific round. The models are again referenced by a hash, implying off-chain storage of the actual model files.
    *   **`evaluateModel()` and `selectWinningModel()`:** Introduces a (simplified) evaluation and selection process. The contract owner (or a designated evaluator in a more complex system) can evaluate submitted models and select a winner. This is a critical step in a collaborative training process.

4.  **Proposal and Voting System (Governance):**
    *   **`createProposal()`:**  A generic proposal system is implemented using `ProposalType` enum, allowing for different types of proposals (GENERIC, DATA\_DELETION, PARAMETER\_CHANGE). This makes the DAO adaptable and governed by its members.
    *   **`voteOnProposal()`:** Members can vote on proposals, and their voting power is weighted by their stake in the DAO. This is a common and important feature of DAOs for fair governance.
    *   **`executeProposal()`:**  Executes proposals that pass based on a simple majority vote (weighted by stake). The contract demonstrates the execution of a `DATA_DELETION` proposal, and this can be extended to other proposal types.

5.  **Rewards and Incentives (Conceptual):**
    *   **`distributeRoundRewards()`:**  This function is a *conceptual* starting point for rewards. It highlights the idea of rewarding the winning model submitter and data contributors.  **Crucially, it's noted that a real implementation would require integration with an ERC20 token and a more sophisticated reward mechanism.**  This function is designed to be a placeholder and inspiration for a more developed reward system.
    *   **`claimRewards()`:** Another conceptual function, indicating the need for members to be able to claim their earned rewards.

6.  **Advanced Solidity Concepts Used:**
    *   **Structs and Mappings:** Used extensively for organizing data (DataContribution, TrainingRound, ModelSubmission, Proposal) and efficient data access.
    *   **Enums:** `ProposalType` enum for defining different proposal categories.
    *   **Modifiers:**  `onlyOwner`, `onlyMember`, `isNotPaused`, `proposalExists`, `isProposalActive`, `isTrainingRoundActive`, `isWithinTrainingRoundDeadline` for access control and contract logic enforcement.
    *   **Events:**  Emitted for important actions, making the contract auditable and allowing for off-chain monitoring.
    *   **Fallback Function (Not Implemented but could be considered):**  For handling direct Ether transfers to the contract (if needed for staking directly with Ether).
    *   **Libraries (Strings):**  A simple library is included for converting uint to string, useful for generating descriptive proposal texts within the contract.
    *   **`payable` Addresses and `transfer()`:** Used for handling Ether transfers for staking and (conceptual) rewards.

**Key Improvements and Further Development Areas (Beyond this example):**

*   **ERC20 Token Integration:**  Replace the conceptual reward system with actual ERC20 token usage for staking and rewards.
*   **More Sophisticated Reward Mechanism:** Design a more nuanced reward system that considers data quality, model performance, and contribution effort. Perhaps introduce reputation scores or tiered reward levels.
*   **Decentralized Evaluation:**  Implement a more decentralized model evaluation process, possibly using oracles or a voting-based evaluation system instead of relying solely on the contract owner.
*   **Parameter Change Proposals:**  Implement the `PARAMETER_CHANGE` proposal type to allow members to vote on changing DAO parameters like minimum stake, voting periods, reward amounts, etc.
*   **Data Storage and Access Control:**  In a real-world scenario, data storage and access control would be a major consideration. This contract uses hashes, implying off-chain storage.  More robust mechanisms for data privacy and security would be needed.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For a production-ready contract, gas optimization would be crucial, especially for functions that involve loops or storage updates.
*   **Error Handling and Security Audits:**  Thorough error handling and security audits are essential before deploying any smart contract, especially one handling funds and governance.
*   **Frontend and Off-Chain Infrastructure:**  A user-friendly frontend and off-chain infrastructure would be needed to interact with this smart contract and facilitate the AI model training process (e.g., data uploading, model training execution, visualization of results).

This contract provides a solid foundation and a good starting point for building a more complex and functional Decentralized Collaborative AI Model Training DAO. It incorporates several advanced concepts and creative functionalities while remaining within the scope of a Solidity smart contract.
