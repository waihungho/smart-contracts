Okay, here's a Solidity smart contract implementing a decentralized, token-gated social club that uses a novel reputation system based on on-chain activity and a curated membership mechanism.  This includes an outline and function summary.

**Outline:**

*   **Contract Name:** `TokenGatedSocialClub`
*   **Core Idea:**  A social club where membership is determined by holding a specific ERC-20 token *and* accumulating reputation within the club through activities like proposing events, voting, and contributing content.  Membership can be revoked by a council of elected members. This system allows for a more dynamic and merit-based membership beyond simply holding tokens.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Token-Gated Entry:** Requires holding a minimum amount of an existing ERC-20 token.
    *   **Reputation System:**  Tracks on-chain activity (proposals, votes, contributions) to award reputation points.
    *   **Member Council:**  A group of elected members who can vote to admit new members or remove existing members.
    *   **Event Proposals:** Members can propose events, and token holders can vote on them.
    *   **Content Contributions:** Members can submit content, which is reviewed and rated by other members (reputation earned based on rating).
    *   **Dynamic Membership:** Reputation can decay over time to incentivize ongoing participation.
    *   **Anti-Sybil Protection:** Reputation decay and council governance help prevent Sybil attacks.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _minTokenBalance, uint256 _councilSize, uint256 _reputationDecayRate)`: Initializes the contract, setting the required token, minimum balance, council size, and reputation decay rate.
*   `joinClub()`: Allows users holding the required tokens to become members (initially with zero reputation).
*   `leaveClub()`: Allows members to leave the club and withdraw their reputation points (converted to a small amount of token).
*   `proposeNewMember(address _newMember)`: Allows existing members to propose new members.
*   `voteOnMember(address _member, bool _approve)`: Allows council members to vote on new member proposals or expulsion of existing members.
*   `submitContent(string memory _contentURI)`: Allows members to submit content (URI to content).
*   `rateContent(uint256 _contentId, uint8 _rating)`: Allows members to rate content submitted by other members, affecting both users' reputation.
*   `proposeEvent(string memory _eventDetailsURI)`: Allows members to propose an event (URI to event details).
*   `voteOnEvent(uint256 _eventId, bool _approve)`: Allows token holders to vote on proposed events.
*   `decayReputation(address _member)`: Manually trigger the reputation decay of specific member.
*   `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _newRate)`: Update the decay rate, only callable by the owner.
*   `getMemberInfo(address _member)`: Returns member-specific information (reputation, isCouncil).
*   `getContentInfo(uint256 _contentId)`: Returns content-specific information (submitter, rating).

```

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Reputation System:**  Members gain reputation for submitting content (with diminishing returns), voting on proposals, and participating in other club activities.  Reputation can decay over time if a member is inactive.  This encourages ongoing engagement.
*   **Member Council:**  A group of elected members who have additional privileges, like voting on new member admissions or expulsions, and changing club parameters (within certain limits, controlled by the owner).  This helps with moderation and prevents abuse.  The number of members is set in the constructor.
*   **Content Rating:**  Members can rate content submitted by other members, which affects both the content creator's and the rater's reputation.  A simple rating system allows for a basic form of content curation.
*   **Dynamic Membership:** Reputation decays over time if a member is inactive.  If reputation falls to zero, the member is effectively removed from the club.  This prevents "dead" members from cluttering the club and keeps the community active.
*   **Event Proposals and Voting:** Members can propose events, and token holders can vote on them.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Some of the array operations (e.g., removing members from `memberList` or council members) can be gas-intensive, especially as the club grows.  For a large club, consider off-chain solutions for managing membership lists and council membership.  The contract also uses OpenZeppelin's `Counters` library for efficient ID generation.
*   **Security:** The contract inherits `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin, providing basic access control.  It also includes checks to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy (although this contract doesn't have external calls that are vulnerable, it's good practice to be aware of it).  The anti-Sybil protection helps prevent malicious actors from creating multiple accounts to manipulate the club.
*   **Events:**  The contract emits events for important actions, allowing external applications to track changes in the club.

**How to Deploy and Interact:**

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the `TokenGatedSocialClub` contract to a test network (like Ropsten or Goerli) using Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.  You'll need to provide the address of an existing ERC-20 token, the minimum token balance required for entry, the council size, and the reputation decay rate (e.g., 1 point per day).
2.  **Interact with the Contract:**
    *   **Join the Club:**  Users holding the required tokens can call the `joinClub()` function.
    *   **Submit Content:**  Members can call the `submitContent()` function, providing a URI to the content.
    *   **Rate Content:**  Members can call the `rateContent()` function to rate content submitted by other members.
    *   **Propose Events:**  Members can call the `proposeEvent()` function, providing a URI to the event details.
    *   **Vote on Events:**  Token holders can call the `voteOnEvent()` function to vote on proposed events.
    *   **Elect/Remove Council Members:** The owner or existing council members can call the `electCouncilMember()` and `removeCouncilMember()` functions.
    *   **Decay Reputation:** Call `decayReputation()` to penalize inactive members.

This improved contract provides a more complete and functional implementation of a token-gated social club with a reputation system.  Remember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Also, consider adding more sophisticated access control mechanisms, input validation, and error handling for a real-world application.
