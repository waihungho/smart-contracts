The "Chronos Protocol" is an advanced, self-evolving decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) designed to manage a treasury of assets, driven by adaptive strategies and a unique skill-weighted reputation system. It aims to create a more resilient, dynamic, and meritocratic on-chain economic entity.

## Chronos Protocol: Outline and Function Summary

**I. Introduction**
*   **Purpose:** To create an adaptive, meritocratic, and self-evolving decentralized future fund. It manages a treasury of assets, adapting its investment strategies based on internal and external factors, and empowers its community through a unique reputation-driven governance model.

**II. State Variables**
*   `guardian`: Emergency pause/unpause address.
*   `paused`: Protocol pause state.
*   `MIN_REP_FOR_GOVERNANCE`: Minimum reputation score required for governance actions.
*   `PROPOSAL_VOTING_PERIOD_BLOCKS`: Duration of governance voting periods.
*   `treasuryWallet`: Address holding the protocol's assets.
*   `approvedTreasuryTokens`: Whitelist of tokens the treasury can hold.
*   `adaptiveStrategies`: Mapping of defined investment strategies.
*   `currentAdaptiveStrategyHash`: Hash of the currently active investment strategy.
*   `externalVaults`, `linkedExternalVaults`: For integrating with external DeFi protocols.
*   `skillAttestations`: Records of attested skills for users.

*   `userBonds`: Records of user-bonded capital for dynamic staking.
*   `tokenBondBaseAPR`: Base Annual Percentage Rate for bonded tokens.
*   `bondYieldClaimInterval`: Frequency for claiming yield from bonds.
*   `protocolHealthOracle`: Address of the external oracle feeding health data.
*   `protocolHealthMetrics`, `healthMetricWeights`: Raw data and weights for the Protocol Health Score.
*   `currentProtocolHealthScore`: The calculated composite health score.
*   `futureVisionProposals`, `activeProposals`: Data structures for governance proposals.
*   `delegatedVotes`: Mapping for vote delegation.

**III. Events**
*   `Paused`, `Unpaused`: Protocol pause state changes.
*   `GuardianSet`, `ProtocolParametersSet`: Configuration updates.
*   `SkillAttested`, `SkillAttestationRevoked`, `ContributionVerified`, `ReputationScoreCalculated`: Reputation system events.
*   `FutureVisionProposed`, `Voted`, `FutureVisionExecuted`, `VotingPowerDelegated`: Governance events.
*   `CapitalBonded`, `CapitalUnbonded`, `YieldClaimed`, `BondingParametersAdjusted`: Dynamic staking events.
*   `OracleDataReceived`, `ProtocolHealthScoreUpdated`, `HealthMetricWeightsSet`: Health score and oracle events.
*   `AdaptiveStrategySet`, `AdaptiveRebalanceExecuted`, `ExternalVaultLinked`, `FundsDepositedIntoExternalVault`, `FundsWithdrawnFromExternalVault`, `EmergencyWithdrawal`: Treasury management events.

**IV. Modifiers**
*   `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`: Control execution based on pause state.

/**
 * @title Chronos Protocol: An Adaptive Decentralized Future Fund
 * @author (Created for this challenge)
 * @notice The Chronos Protocol is an advanced, self-evolving decentralized autonomous organization
 *         designed to manage a treasury of assets, driven by adaptive strategies and a unique
 *         skill-weighted reputation system. It aims to create a more resilient, dynamic, and
 *         meritocratic on-chain economic entity.
 *
 * @dev The protocol incorporates:
 *      - **Adaptive Treasury Management:** Fund allocation strategies that automatically adjust
 *        based on internal 'Protocol Health Score' and external market conditions via oracles.
 *      - **Skill-Weighted & Reputation-Driven Governance:** Voting power is augmented by verifiable
 *        skills and contributions, moving beyond pure token plutocracy.
 *      - **Dynamic Staking & Bonding:** Capital and "labor" (proof-of-contribution) can be bonded
 *        to the protocol for adaptive yield, fostering long-term alignment.
 *      - **Generative "Protocol Health" Score:** A composite on-chain metric reflecting the overall
 *        state and performance of the protocol, influencing adaptive behaviors.
 *      - **"Future Vision" Proposals:** Governance proposals are framed as evolving the protocol's
 *        core logic and adaptive algorithms, not just simple fund allocation.
 *
 * This contract is designed to showcase advanced concepts and unique interactions, not
 * necessarily as a production-ready system without further extensive auditing and development.
