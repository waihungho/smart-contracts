This smart contract, "QuantumLeap DAO," is designed to explore and implement advanced, forward-looking strategic asset management within a decentralized autonomous organization. It focuses on **pre-committing to strategies based on anticipated future market conditions or external data triggers**, allowing the DAO to react dynamically and proactively to a changing environment without requiring real-time, synchronous voting for every event.

The core innovation lies in its `FutureStrategy` and `ScenarioTrigger` mechanisms, enabling the DAO to "time-travel" conceptually by approving actions today that will only execute when specific future conditions are met. This allows for complex, adaptive portfolio management or resource allocation strategies that are voted on and locked in advance.

## QuantumLeap DAO: Strategic Future-State Governance

### Outline

1.  **ForesightToken (ERC-20 with Delegation)**
    *   A governance token (`FST`) for voting power.
    *   Implements Compound-style `delegate` mechanism for flexible voting power management.
    *   Tracks historical voting power for proposal snapshots.
2.  **QuantumLeapDAO Core Contract**
    *   Manages proposals, voting, and execution.
    *   **Future Strategy Proposals**: DAO members propose strategies that include *conditional execution parameters*.
    *   **Scenario Triggers**: Link approved strategies to external data conditions.
    *   **Dynamic Recalibration**: Mechanism to amend or cancel pending future strategies based on new information or votes.
    *   **Treasury Management**: Segregated treasury for future-allocated funds.
    *   **Oracle Integration**: Abstracted interface for external data feeds crucial for scenario activation.
    *   **Expert Delegation**: Allows delegating votes to specific "experts" for particular proposal categories.
    *   **Strategic Review**: A formal process for the community to request reassessment of approved/pending strategies.

### Function Summary

**I. ForesightToken (ERC-20 with Delegation)**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the token, name, symbol, and mints initial supply to the deployer.
2.  `mintInitialSupply(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Mints the initial supply of tokens to a specified address. (Typically called once by deployer).
3.  `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Standard ERC-20 transfer.
4.  `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Standard ERC-20 approve.
5.  `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Standard ERC-20 transferFrom.
6.  `delegate(address delegatee)`: Delegates voting power of `msg.sender` to `delegatee`.
7.  `getVotes(address account)`: Returns the current voting power of an account.
8.  `getPastVotes(address account, uint256 blockNumber)`: Returns the voting power of an account at a specific past block number.
9.  `getPastTotalSupply(uint256 blockNumber)`: Returns the total supply of tokens at a specific past block number.

**II. QuantumLeapDAO**

10. `constructor(address _foresightTokenAddress, address _initialOracleAddress)`: Initializes the DAO with the ForesightToken address and an initial oracle.
11. `configureForesightToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Allows the DAO (via governance) to update the associated ForesightToken address.
12. `proposeFutureStrategy(string memory _description, bytes memory _targetCallData, uint256 _executionTimestamp, address _targetAddress, uint256 _requiredVotes)`: Submits a new future strategy proposal, requiring specific execution details and a minimum vote threshold.
13. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows `FST` holders or their delegates to vote for or against a proposal. Voting power is snapshotted at the block where `proposeFutureStrategy` was called.
14. `queueStrategyExecution(uint256 _proposalId)`: Moves an approved proposal into the executable queue after its voting period ends and it meets vote thresholds.
15. `executeQueuedStrategy(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved and queued proposal if its `_executionTimestamp` has passed and any scenario triggers (if applicable) are met.
16. `recalibrateFutureStrategy(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _newDescription, bytes memory _newTargetCallData, uint256 _newExecutionTimestamp, address _newTargetAddress)`: Allows the DAO to propose and vote on recalibrating (amending) an *already approved but not yet executed* future strategy.
17. `defineScenarioTrigger(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _scenarioType, bytes memory _scenarioData)`: Links an approved future strategy to an external data-driven scenario trigger (e.g., "activate if BTC price > X"). `_scenarioType` could map to different oracle data types.
18. `activateScenarioStrategy(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _scenarioType, bytes memory _oracleReport)`: Called by the designated oracle/keeper. If the `_oracleReport` satisfies the `_scenarioData` for the given `_scenarioType`, the associated strategy is marked as ready for execution (once `_executionTimestamp` is also met).
19. `emergencyPauseStrategy(uint256 _proposalId)`: A high-threshold, expedited vote to temporarily pause a specific future strategy from execution if critical unforeseen circumstances arise.
20. `requestForStrategicReview(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _reason)`: Allows any token holder to formally request a review/re-evaluation of an active or pending strategy due to changed circumstances.
21. `processStrategicReview(uint256 _reviewRequestId, bool _approveReview)`: DAO votes on whether to initiate a full review process (which could then lead to a `recalibrateFutureStrategy` proposal).
22. `stakeForForesight(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake `FST` tokens for a longer period, potentially unlocking enhanced voting power on future-oriented proposals or other benefits (conceptually, not fully implemented beyond basic staking for now).
23. `unstakeForesight(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to withdraw staked `FST` after a lock-up period.
24. `delegateVoteToExpert(uint256 _category, address _expertAddress)`: Allows a user to delegate their votes specifically for proposals within a certain strategic `_category` to a designated "expert" address.
25. `revokeExpertDelegation(uint256 _category)`: Revokes a previously set expert delegation for a specific category.
26. `fundFutureTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: Allows external parties or DAO-initiated transfers to fund a dedicated treasury for future, pre-approved strategies.
27. `withdrawFromFutureTreasury(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Only callable via an executed DAO proposal.
28. `setOracleAddress(address _newOracleAddress)`: Allows the DAO (via governance) to update the trusted oracle address.
29. `submitOracleReport(uint256 _scenarioType, bytes memory _data)`: A mock/abstracted function for the oracle to report data. In a real-world scenario, this would be more sophisticated (e.g., Chainlink external adapters).
30. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to check the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Canceled, Queued, Executed).
31. `getScenarioStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to check if a scenario trigger for a proposal has been met.
32. `getAvailableTreasury()`: View function to check the current balance of the future-focused treasury.
33. `getDelegatedExpert(uint256 _category, address _delegator)`: View function to see who an address has delegated votes to for a specific category.
