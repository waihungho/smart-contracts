This smart contract, named `EpochalPredictiveTreasury`, is designed to be an advanced, creative, and trendy protocol that combines a decentralized prediction market with a dynamic, DAO-governed treasury. The core idea revolves around users predicting future market events over defined "epochs," staking a native token ($PREDICT) on their predictions. Correct predictions are rewarded, and importantly, the collective intelligence of successful predictors (or an external AI oracle's signals) can influence how the protocol's treasury assets are deployed into various DeFi strategies. This simulates an "AI-driven" asset management system where the "AI" is either a trusted oracle or the emergent wisdom of the crowd.

The contract incorporates concepts like:
*   **Epoch-based Prediction Markets:** Structured, time-bound prediction rounds.
*   **Oracle Integration:** A trusted external entity for reporting true outcomes.
*   **Dynamic Treasury Management:** A multi-asset treasury managed by the DAO.
*   **Strategy Vault:** A mechanism for deploying treasury funds into external DeFi protocols based on governance decisions (potentially informed by successful prediction patterns).
*   **Native Tokenomics:** A `$PREDICT` token for staking, governance, and rewards.
*   **Simplified DAO Governance:** For critical decisions like treasury allocation, strategy changes, and contract upgrades.
*   **Upgradability:** Using the UUPS proxy pattern for future-proofing.
*   **Emergency Controls:** A pause mechanism for security.

## EpochalPredictiveTreasury Smart Contract

**Core Concept:** A decentralized protocol where users predict future outcomes (e.g., asset price movements) over defined epochs by staking a native token ($PREDICT). Correct predictors are rewarded, and the protocol's treasury is dynamically managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) based on successful prediction strategies and governance votes. This contract simulates elements of an AI-driven treasury by having an `oracleAddress` provide "signals" (actual outcomes) and a "Strategy Vault" that can deploy funds based on collective successful predictions.

**Outline:**

1.  **Libraries & Interfaces:** Imports for necessary functionalities (ERC-20, OpenZeppelin utilities).
2.  **Constants & State Variables:** Core data structures, addresses, and protocol parameters.
3.  **Events:** For tracking significant actions and state changes.
4.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state-based checks to enforce rules.
5.  **Constructor & Initialization:** Setting up the contract for proxy deployment.
6.  **Core Prediction Market Logic:**
    *   Epoch Management & Creation
    *   Prediction Submission & Staking Mechanisms
    *   Oracle Outcome Reporting
    *   Reward & Stake Claiming
7.  **Treasury & Strategy Vault Management:**
    *   Asset Deposit & Withdrawal Functions
    *   DAO-driven Strategy Proposal & Execution (allocating funds to DeFi protocols)
    *   Yield Tracking & Position Liquidation from strategies
8.  **Tokenomics & Governance Logic:**
    *   Staking `$PREDICT` for Governance Power
    *   Vote Delegation
    *   Simplified DAO Proposal & Voting System
    *   Token Minting for Rewards and Protocol Incentives
9.  **Administrative & Emergency Functions:**
    *   Oracle Address Updates & Epoch Parameter Configuration
    *   Emergency Pause/Unpause Mechanism
    *   Contract Upgradability through DAO vote

**Function Summary (23 Functions):**

**I. Initialization & Configuration:**
1.  `initialize(address _governanceToken, address _oracleAddress, uint256 _minStake, uint256 _maxStake)`: Sets initial contract parameters upon deployment (via UUPS proxy).
2.  `setOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Allows governance to update the trusted oracle's address.
3.  `updateEpochParameters(uint256 _minStake, uint256 _maxStake, uint256 _rewardFee)`: Allows governance to adjust prediction market parameters like minimum stake, maximum stake, and the protocol's reward fee.

**II. Core Prediction Market Functions:**
4.  `startNewEpoch(uint256 duration, bytes32 assetIdentifier)`: Initiates a new prediction round for a specific asset, defining its duration.
5.  `submitPrediction(bytes32 epochId, bool predictionOutcome, uint256 amount)`: Users stake `$PREDICT` tokens on their chosen outcome (e.g., `true` for 'up', `false` for 'down') for a specific epoch.
6.  `updateOracleOutcome(bytes32 epochId, bool actualOutcome)`: The approved oracle reports the final, verifiable outcome for a given epoch, resolving it.
7.  `claimPredictionRewards(bytes32 epochId)`: Correct predictors (who staked on the actual outcome) can claim their proportional share of the reward pool for that epoch.
8.  `withdrawIncorrectStakes(bytes32 epochId)`: Allows users who predicted incorrectly to withdraw their *remaining* stake after a protocol fee or slashing has been applied.

**III. Treasury & Strategy Vault Functions:**
9.  `depositToTreasury(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone to contribute any supported ERC-20 asset to the DAO-controlled treasury.
10. `withdrawFromTreasury(address token, uint256 amount, address recipient)`: A DAO-governed function to withdraw specific amounts of assets from the treasury to a designated recipient.
11. `proposeStrategyAllocation(bytes32 strategyId, address targetProtocol, address token, uint256 amount)`: Governance (users with staked `$PREDICT`) can propose allocating treasury funds to an external DeFi strategy (e.g., a lending pool, yield farm).
12. `voteOnStrategyProposal(bytes32 proposalId, bool support)`: Staked governance token holders vote on active strategy allocation proposals.
13. `executeStrategyAllocation(bytes32 proposalId)`: Executes a passed strategy allocation proposal, deploying the specified funds to the target DeFi protocol.
14. `recordStrategyVaultYield(bytes32 strategyId, address token, uint256 yieldAmount)`: Allows a trusted role (or the strategy itself, if designed) to record yield generated by an active strategy position.
15. `liquidateStrategyPosition(bytes32 strategyId)`: A DAO-governed function to close an active strategy position, withdrawing all associated funds and returning them to the treasury.

**IV. Tokenomics & Governance Functions:**
16. `stakeForGovernance(uint256 amount)`: Users lock their `$PREDICT` tokens into the contract to gain voting power in the DAO.
17. `unstakeFromGovernance(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to unlock and retrieve their staked `$PREDICT` tokens after a defined cool-down period.
18. `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Enables users to delegate their voting power to another address, without transferring their tokens.
19. `proposeUpgrade(address newImplementation)`: Governance can propose upgrading the contract's logic to a new implementation address.
20. `executeUpgrade()`: Executes a passed contract upgrade proposal, pointing the proxy to the new implementation.
21. `mintTokensForRewards(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: A DAO-governed function that allows the protocol to mint new `$PREDICT` tokens, typically for distributing rewards, grants, or bolstering the treasury. This contract must be granted the Minter role on the `$PREDICT` token contract.

**V. Emergency & Utility Functions:**
22. `emergencyPause()`: Allows the designated admin/owner to pause all critical operations of the contract in an emergency (e.g., a critical bug, security vulnerability).
23. `emergencyUnpause()`: Allows the designated admin/owner to unpause operations once an emergency has been resolved and the system is deemed safe.
