/**
 * @title Decentralized AI Art Curator and Marketplace
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @notice This contract enables artists to submit their AI-generated artwork for curation by token holders, 
 *         and facilitates the sale of curated pieces with a royalty mechanism.  It incorporates voting, 
 *         timed auctions, and a reputation system for curators.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *  1. **Data Structures:** Defines structs for Artwork, Curator, and Auction.
 *  2. **State Variables:** Manages artwork submissions, curator details, auction data, token addresses, fees, and reputation tracking.
 *  3. **Modifiers:** Enforces restrictions such as onlyArtist, onlyCurator, onlyGovernance, etc.
 *  4. **Functions:**
 *     - **submitArtwork(string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _title):** Artists submit their AI-generated artwork with an IPFS hash and title.
 *     - **requestCuration(uint256 _artworkId):**  Any address requests that an artwork be submitted for curation.  Can only be requested once per artwork.
 *     - **addCurator(address _curator, string memory _name, string memory _description):**  Governance adds approved curator addresses.
 *     - **removeCurator(address _curator):**  Governance removes curator addresses.
 *     - **voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve):** Curators vote on whether to curate an artwork.  Affects curator reputation based on outcome.
 *     - **startAuction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _duration, uint256 _startingBid):** Starts an auction for a curated artwork.  Only callable by governance.
 *     - **bid(uint256 _artworkId):** Allows users to bid on an active auction.
 *     - **endAuction(uint256 _artworkId):**  Ends the auction and transfers the artwork ownership and funds.
 *     - **buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId):** Directly buy an artwork at the reserve price.
 *     - **withdrawFunds():** Allows the contract owner (governance) to withdraw accrued fees.
 *     - **reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reportReason):** Allows users to report an artwork for violating terms of service. Requires token stake.
 *     - **resolveReport(uint256 _artworkId, bool _banArtwork):** Governance resolves reports, potentially banning artwork.
 *     - **setGovernance(address _newGovernance):** Allows the current governance address to set a new governance address.
 *
 *  **Advanced Concepts:**
 *  - **Decentralized Curation:** Token holders curate artwork, preventing a single point of failure.
 *  - **Curator Reputation:**  Track curator accuracy to encourage responsible voting.
 *  - **Timed Auctions:** Time-boxed auctions create scarcity and drive value.
 *  - **Reporting Mechanism:**  Users can flag content for review, creating a self-policing community.
 *  - **Governance Controlled:** Key functions (adding curators, setting fees) are controlled by a designated governance address.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summaries:** The code starts with a concise outline of the contract's structure and purpose, followed by detailed summaries for each function.  This drastically improves readability.
* **Advanced Concepts Implemented:** The contract incorporates the advanced concepts outlined in the prompt:
    * **Decentralized Curation:** Uses token holders (represented by `curators`) to vote on artwork curation.
    * **Curator Reputation:** Tracks curator performance by adjusting their `reputation` based on the outcome of their votes, incentivizing accurate curation.
    * **Timed Auctions:** Implements timed auctions for selling curated artwork.
    * **Reporting Mechanism:** Allows users to report artwork that violates terms of service, creating a self-policing community.
    * **Governance Control:** Restricts key administrative functions (adding/removing curators, setting fees, resolving reports) to a designated `governance` address, allowing for community-led moderation.
* **IPFS Storage:** Utilizes IPFS for storing artwork data.
* **Auction Functionality:** Implements bidding, ending auctions, and refunding previous bids.
* **Direct Purchase Option:** Allows users to directly buy an artwork at its reserve price.
* **Royalty and Platform Fees:** Manages royalty payments to the original artist and platform fees.
* **Reporting and Moderation:**  Implements a robust reporting mechanism where users can flag artwork and governance can resolve those reports (including banning the artwork).  Includes a stake requirement to prevent spam.
* **Events:** Emits events to track key actions within the contract, which is crucial for off-chain monitoring and indexing.
* **Modifiers:** Uses modifiers to enforce access control and other constraints, making the code more readable and secure.  `onlyArtist`, `onlyCurator`, `onlyGovernance`, `artworkExists`, `auctionActive`, `artworkNotBanned`.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to check for invalid conditions and prevent unexpected behavior.  Error messages are descriptive.
* **Gas Optimization:**  While not exhaustively optimized, the code is written with gas efficiency in mind. More aggressive gas optimization could involve caching values, using smaller data types where appropriate, and carefully considering loop structures.  However, readability and maintainability are prioritized over micro-optimizations.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Access Control:** Uses modifiers to restrict access to sensitive functions.
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The transfer of funds to the artist uses `transfer()`, which mitigates re-entrancy vulnerabilities (though more complex payout schemes might require more sophisticated re-entrancy guards).
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Solidity 0.8.0 and later handle integer overflow/underflow automatically, preventing these vulnerabilities.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The `curatorCount()` and `getCuratorAddresses()` function has a *major* DoS vulnerability. Iterating through *all* possible Ethereum addresses is *incredibly* expensive and would cause the contract to run out of gas. This is fixed by removing those methods, adding a `registeredCurators` mapping and adding and removing addresses when `addCurator` and `removeCurator` are called. *Important note* This change requires more storage and has a higher upfront cost.

This improved version addresses the previous feedback and provides a more complete and robust implementation of the desired functionality. It also uses best practices for smart contract development in Solidity.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment. Also, consider using OpenZeppelin contracts for common functionality like access control and ERC-721 token implementation to ensure security and compliance.
