 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling collaborative art creation,
 * ownership, and governance. This contract incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic NFT traits,
 * algorithmic art influence, decentralized curation, and tiered membership with evolving benefits.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 * 1. `joinCollective(string _artistName)`: Allows artists to join the collective by paying a membership fee and registering their artist name.
 * 2. `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective, potentially with conditions on active contributions.
 * 3. `proposeRuleChange(string _ruleDescription, bytes _ruleData)`: Members can propose changes to the collective's rules and operational parameters.
 * 4. `voteOnRuleChange(uint _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on proposed rule changes. Voting power can be tiered based on contribution.
 * 5. `executeRuleChange(uint _proposalId)`: Executes a rule change if it passes the voting threshold.
 * 6. `getMemberDetails(address _memberAddress)`: Retrieves details of a member, including artist name, membership level, and contribution score.
 * 7. `getRuleProposalDetails(uint _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific rule proposal.
 * 8. `getCollectiveRules()`: Returns a list of current collective rules (potentially stored off-chain and referenced here).
 * 9. `upgradeMembership()`: Allows members to upgrade their membership tier by meeting certain criteria or paying an upgrade fee.
 *
 * **Art Creation & NFT Management:**
 * 10. `submitArtConcept(string _conceptDescription, string _artStyle)`: Members can submit art concepts for potential collective creation.
 * 11. `voteOnArtConcept(uint _conceptId, bool _vote)`: Members vote on submitted art concepts to decide which ones to pursue.
 * 12. `createCollectiveArt(uint _conceptId)`:  Initiates the creation of a collective artwork based on a winning concept (potentially triggering off-chain processes or oracles for actual art generation).
 * 13. `mintArtNFT(uint _artId, string _nftTitle, string _nftDescription, string _nftMetadataURI)`: Mints an NFT representing a piece of collective art, with dynamic traits influenced by collective input.
 * 14. `transferArtNFT(uint _nftId, address _recipient)`: Transfers ownership of an Art NFT.
 * 15. `burnArtNFT(uint _nftId)`: Allows for burning of Art NFTs under specific governance conditions.
 * 16. `getArtNFTDetails(uint _nftId)`: Retrieves details of an Art NFT, including dynamic traits, creator credits, and provenance.
 * 17. `listArtNFTForSale(uint _nftId, uint _price)`: Allows the collective to list Art NFTs for sale in a decentralized marketplace (integration point).
 * 18. `buyArtNFT(uint _nftId)`: Allows users to purchase Art NFTs listed by the collective.
 *
 * **Financial & Incentive Mechanisms:**
 * 19. `depositFunds()`: Allows members and external parties to deposit funds into the collective's treasury.
 * 20. `withdrawFunds(uint _amount)`: Allows authorized members (governed by rules) to withdraw funds from the treasury for collective purposes.
 * 21. `distributeArtRevenue(uint _nftId)`: Distributes revenue from the sale of Art NFTs to contributors and the collective treasury based on predefined rules.
 * 22. `rewardConceptSubmitter(uint _conceptId)`: Rewards the member who submitted a winning art concept.
 * 23. `getContractBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the contract treasury.
 * 24. `setMembershipFee(uint _newFee)`: Function to change the membership fee, governed by rule proposals. (Example of rule-changeable parameter).
 * 25. `setNFTMintingCost(uint _newCost)`: Function to change the NFT minting cost, governed by rule proposals. (Another example of rule-changeable parameter).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The core concept is to create a DAO specifically for art creation, going beyond typical financial DAOs. This is trendy and creative as it taps into the growing intersection of crypto, NFTs, and art.

2.  **Tiered Membership:** The `members` struct includes `membershipTier`.  The `upgradeMembership()` function hints at a tiered system where members can gain more benefits (voting power, lower minting costs, etc.) based on contribution or other criteria. This adds a layer of progression and engagement.

3.  **Contribution Score:**  The `contributionScore` in the `Member` struct is a placeholder for a more advanced system to track member participation. This score could be increased by submitting concepts, voting actively, curating, or other contributions. Higher scores could unlock higher membership tiers or other rewards.

4.  **Dynamic NFT Traits (Conceptual):** While this contract doesn't *generate* art, the `createCollectiveArt()` function is intended to trigger an off-chain process (potentially using oracles or AI) to create art based on approved concepts. The resulting NFTs could then have dynamic traits influenced by the collective's input, making each NFT unique and tied to the community's decisions.

5.  **Algorithmic Art Influence (Conceptual):** The `artStyle` in `submitArtConcept()` and the idea of off-chain art generation suggest that the collective can influence the style and nature of the art produced.  This hints at using algorithms or AI tools to generate art based on the collective's direction.

6.  **Decentralized Curation:** The `voteOnArtConcept()` function implements a decentralized curation process. Members vote on submitted art concepts, ensuring that the collective decides which artistic directions to pursue.

7.  **Rule Proposals and On-Chain Governance:** The `proposeRuleChange()`, `voteOnRuleChange()`, and `executeRuleChange()` functions enable on-chain governance. Members can propose and vote on changes to the collective's rules, parameters (like membership fees, minting costs), and potentially even the art creation process itself.

8.  **Revenue Distribution Mechanism:** `distributeArtRevenue()` demonstrates a basic revenue-sharing model for NFT sales. Revenue can be distributed to concept submitters, the collective treasury, and potentially NFT minters, incentivizing different forms of contribution.

9.  **Concept Submission and Voting:** The `submitArtConcept()` and `voteOnArtConcept()` functions create a pipeline for collaborative art idea generation and selection.

10. **Reward System for Concept Submitters:** `rewardConceptSubmitter()` directly incentivizes creative input by rewarding members whose concepts are chosen.

11. **NFT Listing and Basic Marketplace Integration:** `listArtNFTForSale()` and `buyArtNFT()` provide basic functions for listing and buying Art NFTs within the collective, hinting at potential integration with decentralized marketplaces.

12. **NFT Burning (Governance Conditioned):** `burnArtNFT()` allows for the destruction of NFTs, which can be useful for managing supply or under specific governance-defined conditions.

13. **Configurable Parameters (via Governance):**  Membership fees (`setMembershipFee`), NFT minting costs (`setNFTMintingCost`), voting durations, quorum percentages, etc., are designed to be configurable through rule proposals, making the DAAC adaptable and community-governed.

14. **Clear Event Logging:** The contract uses numerous events to log important actions (member joins, proposals, votes, NFT minting, sales, etc.), making it easier to track activity and build off-chain interfaces or analytics.

15. **Modularity and Extensibility:** The contract is structured with clear sections (Membership, Governance, Art Creation, Finance), making it more modular and easier to extend with further features.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Off-Chain Art Generation:**  This contract focuses on the *governance* and *management* of a DAAC. The actual art generation process is assumed to be happening off-chain, triggered by the contract's functions (like `createCollectiveArt()`). In a real-world application, you would need to integrate with oracles, AI services, or other off-chain mechanisms to generate the art and obtain metadata URIs for the NFTs.
*   **Simplified NFT Management:** The NFT functionality in this contract is simplified for demonstration. For a production-ready DAAC with NFTs, you would typically integrate with ERC721 or ERC1155 standards for robust NFT ownership, metadata management, and marketplace compatibility.
*   **Security and Audits:** This is a conceptual contract example. In a real-world deployment, it's crucial to conduct thorough security audits and implement best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
*   **Rule Data Encoding:** The `ruleData` in `RuleProposal` is handled in a very basic way in the `executeRuleChange()` function (using `keccak256` and `bytes32` casting for demonstration). A more robust system would involve proper encoding and decoding of rule parameters using ABI encoding and potentially more structured data formats.
*   **Treasury Management:**  The treasury address is a simple payable address. For enhanced security and governance of treasury funds, you might consider using a multi-signature wallet or a more sophisticated DAO treasury management contract.

This smart contract provides a foundation for a creative and advanced DAAC concept, showcasing a range of interesting functionalities beyond basic token contracts or simple DAOs. You can further expand upon these ideas to build a more comprehensive and unique decentralized art ecosystem.
