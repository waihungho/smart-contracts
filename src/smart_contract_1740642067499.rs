/**
 * @title Dynamic NFT Airdrop & Staking Contract - "QuantumDrop"
 * @author Gemini AI (Example - Replace with actual author)
 * @notice This contract facilitates dynamic NFT airdrops based on on-chain staking, allowing for tiered rewards and potential upgrades based on staking duration and amount.  It leverages a simplified NFT interface for demonstration purposes.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Simplified NFT Interface:** Defines a minimal NFT interface for interaction.
 * 2. **Staking Logic:** Allows users to stake ERC20 tokens, tracking duration and amount.
 * 3. **Dynamic Airdrop Eligibility:**  Determines NFT airdrop eligibility based on staked amount and duration.  Eligibility can dynamically change.
 * 4. **Tiered Rewards:**  Airdrop different NFT types/tiers based on staking tiers.
 * 5. **NFT Upgrades (Potential Future Feature):**  Potentially allows for NFT upgrades/transformations based on continued staking.
 * 6. **Emergency Withdrawal:**  Allows contract owner to withdraw all ERC20 in case of vulnerabilities or unexpected events.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `constructor(IERC20 _stakeToken, address _nftContract, address _owner)`: Initializes the contract with the ERC20 token address, NFT contract address, and owner.
 * - `stake(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake ERC20 tokens.
 * - `unstake()`: Allows users to unstake their ERC20 tokens.
 * - `isEligibleForAirdrop(address _account)`: Checks if an account is eligible for an NFT airdrop.
 * - `claimAirdrop()`:  Allows eligible users to claim their NFT airdrop.  Only callable once.
 * - `setTierThresholds(uint256 _tier1Amount, uint256 _tier2Amount, uint256 _tier3Amount)`: Sets the staking thresholds for different NFT airdrop tiers.
 * - `emergencyWithdrawal(address _tokenAddress)`: Allows the owner to withdraw stuck tokens
 * - `getTier(address _account)`: Returns the staking tier of an account.
 * - `getStakeInfo(address _account)`:  Returns staking information (amount and start time) for an account.
 * - `updateNFTContract(address _newNFTContract)`: Allows the owner to update the NFT contract address.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Airdrop Eligibility:** The `isEligibleForAirdrop` function now explicitly checks for a minimum staking duration *and* the staked amount. This creates a more flexible and rewarding system.
* **Tiered Rewards:** The `claimAirdrop` function now uses the `getTier` function to determine the user's staking tier and can be expanded with more advanced reward generation based on tier.  The code provides a placeholder comment illustrating where you would implement tier-based NFT characteristics.
* **Simplified NFT Interface:** The code includes a simplified `INFT` interface.  **Important:**  You MUST replace this with the *actual* interface of the NFT contract you intend to use.  This interface allows the contract to mint NFTs on your external NFT contract.  It's crucial for the airdrop to function.  It also assumes that the NFT contract has a `totalSupply()` function, which is a common practice in NFT contracts. This contract now uses that total supply to increment a unique tokenId.
* **Clear Event Emissions:** The code emits events for key actions (staking, unstaking, airdrop claiming, and tier updates) which allows for off-chain monitoring and tracking.  This is important for user experience and auditing.
* **`SafeMath` Usage:** Uses `SafeMath` for safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflows/underflows.  This is considered best practice for Solidity smart contracts.  OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` is included via import.
* **`Ownable` Contract:**  The `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin is used to restrict sensitive functions (like setting tier thresholds and updating the NFT contract) to the contract owner.
* **Gas Optimization (Considerations):** While this is a functional contract, further gas optimizations could be explored.  For example: caching frequently used values, using assembly, and minimizing storage writes.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to enforce conditions and provide informative error messages.  This improves the user experience and helps debug issues.
* **Security Considerations:** The `emergencyWithdrawal` function is included as a safeguard.  However, reliance on this function indicates a potential vulnerability in the primary logic. Proper auditing and testing are critical before deployment.
* **Upgradeability (Future Considerations):**  While the `updateNFTContract` function provides a simple upgrade path, more sophisticated upgrade patterns (e.g., proxy contracts, diamond pattern) could be considered for more complex upgrades.
* **Clear Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and variable.
* **Emergency Withdrawal Function:** Added a function to handle tokens stuck in the contract.  This is an important safety feature.
* **Prevent accidental ETH transfer:** Prevents accidentally sending ETH to this contract

How to use this contract:

1.  **Deployments:**
    *   Deploy an ERC20 token contract.  Note the address.
    *   Deploy an NFT contract (using your preferred NFT standard - ERC721, ERC1155, etc.). Note the address.
    *   Deploy the `QuantumDrop` contract, providing the ERC20 token address, the NFT contract address, and the owner address as constructor arguments.
2.  **Configuration (Owner Only):**
    *   Call `setTierThresholds()` to set the staking thresholds for the different tiers.
    *  Consider setting the owner to a multisig wallet for better security
3.  **Staking (Users):**
    *   Users must first `approve` the `QuantumDrop` contract to spend their ERC20 tokens. This is done by calling `approve` on the ERC20 token contract itself.  For example: `stakeToken.approve(address(quantumDropContract), uint2**256-1);`
    *   Users then call the `stake()` function on the `QuantumDrop` contract to stake their tokens.
4.  **Claiming Airdrops (Users):**
    *   Users call `claimAirdrop()` to claim their NFT if they meet the eligibility requirements.
5.  **Potential upgrades:** Implement logic to update the NFT airdrop characteristics based on tier.

**Crucial Security Note:**  This is example code and requires thorough auditing and testing before deployment to a production environment.  Pay close attention to potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks, integer overflows/underflows, and front-running. Consider using a formal verification tool to ensure the correctness of the contract logic.

This improved version addresses the feedback and provides a more complete, secure, and functional dynamic NFT airdrop contract. Remember to adapt the code and NFT interface to your specific needs and conduct thorough testing.  Good luck!
