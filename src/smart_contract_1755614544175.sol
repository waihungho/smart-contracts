This smart contract, "QuantumLeap DAO," is designed to be a self-evolving, mission-driven decentralized autonomous organization. It introduces dynamic governance parameters that adapt based on the collective success of its past "missions" and the individual reputation of its members. Unlike typical DAOs focused solely on fund management or simple voting, QuantumLeap DAO integrates a reputation system, a sophisticated mission lifecycle, and an adaptive scoring mechanism that influences its operational parameters, fostering a truly adaptive and meritocratic environment.

## QuantumLeap DAO: Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumLeapDAO`

**Core Concept:** A dynamic, self-evolving DAO where governance parameters (quorum, voting duration) adapt based on the collective success score of "missions" undertaken by the DAO. Members have a dynamic reputation score that influences their voting power and resource allocation.

**Key Advanced Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Adaptive Governance:** Quorum and voting duration for proposals dynamically adjust based on the DAO's overall `daoSuccessScore`.
2.  **Reputation System:** Members earn reputation through successful mission contributions and positive proposal votes, which decays over time and can be penalized for failures. Reputation directly impacts voting power and resource distribution.
3.  **Mission Lifecycle:** Structured process for proposing, funding, executing, updating, evaluating, and archiving projects ("Missions"). Mission success/failure directly impacts the `daoSuccessScore`.
4.  **Epoch-based Resource Distribution:** Periodically, a portion of the DAO's treasury (`resourcePool`) is distributed to members based on their current reputation.
5.  **Commit-Reveal (Conceptual):** While not fully implemented with ZKPs for brevity, the evaluation of missions by members is a form of collective judgment that could be extended to more complex commit-reveal for fairness.
6.  **Emergency Mechanisms:** Pausability and an emergency bailout option controlled by the DAO owner (which can be transferred via governance).

### **Function Summary:**

1.  **`constructor(uint256 _minPledge, uint256 _minRepForProp, uint256 _epochDuration)`**
    *   Initializes the DAO with an owner, minimum ETH pledge to join, minimum reputation to create proposals, and the duration of an epoch.

2.  **`joinDAO() payable`**
    *   Allows any address to join the DAO by paying `minPledgeAmount`. Grants initial reputation.

3.  **`leaveDAO()`**
    *   Allows a member to leave the DAO, provided they have no active proposals or missions. Their pledge is returned, and reputation is reset.

4.  **`depositFunds() payable`**
    *   Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the DAO's treasury.

5.  **`withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`**
    *   Allows the DAO owner to withdraw funds, but **only** if approved via a `TRANSFER_OWNERSHIP` or `EMERGENCY_BAILOUT` proposal. *Note: For security, direct owner withdrawal should be restricted via governance.* This function would typically be called by `executeProposal`.

6.  **`createProposal(string memory _description, ProposalType _proposalType, address _targetAddress, uint256 _value, bytes memory _callData)`**
    *   Allows a member with sufficient reputation to create a new governance proposal. Sets a dynamic voting end time based on `daoSuccessScore`.

7.  **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**
    *   Allows a DAO member to cast a vote on an active proposal. Voting power is weighted by the member's current reputation.

8.  **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**
    *   Finalizes a proposal if the voting period has ended and it met the adaptive quorum and majority requirements. Triggers the specific action defined by the `ProposalType`.

9.  **`proposeMission(string memory _name, string memory _description, uint256 _budget, uint256 _deadline)`**
    *   Allows a member with sufficient reputation to propose a new mission, outlining its budget and deadline.

10. **`fundMissionViaProposal(uint256 _missionId)`**
    *   This function is intended to be called by `executeProposal` after a `FUND_MISSION` proposal passes. It transfers the allocated budget from the DAO treasury to the mission lead.

11. **`updateMissionProgress(uint256 _missionId, string memory _progressReport)`**
    *   Allows the designated mission lead to update the progress report of an active mission.

12. **`requestMissionEvaluation(uint256 _missionId)`**
    *   Allows the mission lead to mark their mission as ready for evaluation by the DAO members.

13. **`evaluateMission(uint256 _missionId, uint256 _successFactor)`**
    *   Allows DAO members to evaluate a mission that is `UnderEvaluation`. The `_successFactor` (e.g., 0-100) from members' collective input directly impacts the DAO's `daoSuccessScore` and the reputation of the mission lead.

14. **`archiveMission(uint256 _missionId)`**
    *   Moves a mission to the `Archived` state, typically after its evaluation is complete.

15. **`setMissionLead(uint256 _missionId, address _newLead)`**
    *   Allows changing the lead of a mission, likely triggered by a `GENERIC` proposal.

16. **`getMemberReputation(address _member)`**
    *   Returns the current reputation score of a specific member.

17. **`getAdaptiveQuorum()`**
    *   Calculates and returns the dynamically adjusted quorum percentage required for proposals, based on the `daoSuccessScore`.

18. **`getAdaptiveVotingDuration()`**
    *   Calculates and returns the dynamically adjusted voting duration in seconds for proposals, based on the `daoSuccessScore`.

19. **`setAdaptiveParameters(uint256 _quorumFactor, uint256 _durationMultiplier, uint256 _minRepForProp)`**
    *   Allows the DAO (via governance proposal) to adjust the base factors for adaptive quorum, voting duration, and minimum reputation for proposals.

20. **`kickMember(address _memberToKick)`**
    *   Removes a member from the DAO, likely called via `executeProposal` if a `KICK_MEMBER` proposal passes. Their pledge is not returned.

21. **`advanceQuantumEpoch()`**
    *   Advances the DAO to the next quantum epoch. This function triggers reputation decay for all members and distributes resources from the `resourcePool` based on current reputation. Can only be called after `epochDuration` has passed.

22. **`distributeEpochResources()`**
    *   An internal function (but conceptually external trigger via `advanceQuantumEpoch`) that distributes a portion of the `resourcePool` to members based on their reputation score during an epoch advancement.

23. **`getDaoMetrics()`**
    *   Returns key metrics of the DAO including its current `daoSuccessScore`, number of members, total treasury balance, and current epoch.

24. **`getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`**
    *   Retrieves all details of a specific proposal.

25. **`getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`**
    *   Returns the current status (Pending, Succeeded, Failed, Executed) of a specific proposal.

26. **`getMissionDetails(uint256 _missionId)`**
    *   Retrieves all details of a specific mission.

27. **`getMissionStatus(uint256 _missionId)`**
    *   Returns the current status (Proposed, Active, UnderEvaluation, Evaluated, Archived) of a specific mission.

28. **`getPledgeAmount(address _member)`**
    *   Returns the ETH pledge amount for a specific member.

29. **`claimPledge()`**
    *   Allows a member who has successfully left the DAO to claim their initial pledge.

30. **`pauseContract()`**
    *   Allows the DAO owner (or approved via governance) to pause critical functions of the contract in case of an emergency.

31. **`unpauseContract()`**
    *   Allows the DAO owner to unpause the contract after an emergency has been resolved.

32. **`emergencyBailout(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`**
    *   Allows the DAO owner to transfer funds out of the contract in extreme emergencies, bypassing normal governance. This should be used with extreme caution and ideally its activation should also be subject to a special, high-threshold governance vote.
