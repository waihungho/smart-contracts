/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for managing a decentralized art gallery.
 * It features advanced concepts like decentralized curation, dynamic exhibitions,
 * artist royalties, community governance, and innovative engagement mechanisms.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1. `submitArt(string memory _artUri)`: Artists submit their artwork to the gallery, providing a URI.
 * 2. `curateArt(uint256 _artId, bool _approve)`: Curators vote to approve or reject submitted artwork.
 * 3. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _exhibitionTheme, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Curators create new exhibitions with names, themes, and timeframes.
 * 4. `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Curators add approved artwork to specific exhibitions.
 * 5. `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Curators remove artwork from exhibitions.
 * 6. `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curators manually start an exhibition (can also be time-based).
 * 7. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curators manually end an exhibition (can also be time-based).
 * 8. `viewExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: View public details of a specific exhibition.
 * 9. `viewArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: View public details of a specific artwork.
 * 10. `supportArtist(uint256 _artId)`: Users can support artists by sending ETH as a donation for a specific artwork.
 *
 * **Governance and Community Features:**
 * 11. `proposeRuleChange(string memory _proposalDescription, string memory _newRule)`: Community members can propose changes to gallery rules.
 * 12. `voteOnRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Community members can vote on proposed rule changes.
 * 13. `executeRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Gallery owner can execute approved rule changes after voting.
 * 14. `setCuratorRole(address _curatorAddress, bool _isCurator)`: Gallery owner can assign or revoke curator roles.
 * 15. `reportArt(uint256 _artId, string memory _reportReason)`: Users can report artwork for policy violations.
 * 16. `moderateArtReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _actionTaken)`: Curators can moderate reported artwork and take action (e.g., remove from exhibition, ban artist - more advanced features can be added).
 *
 * **Artist and Profile Management:**
 * 17. `setArtistProfile(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio)`: Artists can set up or update their profile information.
 * 18. `viewArtistProfile(address _artistAddress)`: View public profile information of an artist.
 * 19. `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw accumulated donations/earnings.
 *
 * **Utility and Admin Functions:**
 * 20. `pauseContract()`: Gallery owner can pause the contract for emergency or maintenance.
 * 21. `unpauseContract()`: Gallery owner can unpause the contract.
 * 22. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Gallery owner can set a fee percentage for certain transactions (future monetization).
 * 23. `getGalleryFee()`: View the current gallery fee percentage.
