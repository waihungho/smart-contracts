Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract demonstrating a range of interesting and advanced concepts, focusing on dynamic logic, conditional execution, asset management, and novel interaction patterns. It's designed as a kind of "Nexus" or "Hub" for various on-chain operations.

It avoids being a simple ERC-20/721 clone, a standard DeFi pool, or a typical DAO/marketplace template. Instead, it combines elements of scheduled tasks, conditional logic, proof verification, specific asset rights delegation, and controlled external calls.

---

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Setup:** License, Pragma, Imports (Basic utilities like Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, Interfaces for ERC-20/721).
2.  **State Variables:** Storing core contract state, mappings for permissions, scheduled tasks, Merkle roots, interaction proofs, time locks, NFT right delegations, permissioned actions, conditional logic configurations, etc.
3.  **Events:** Signaling key contract actions, state changes, and outcomes.
4.  **Modifiers:** Custom conditions or access checks (beyond standard Ownable/Pausable).
5.  **Core Management (Admin/Security):** Pausing, upgrading (conceptual), emergency rescues, setting permissions.
6.  **Asset Management (ERC-20 & ERC-721):** Depositing, withdrawing, internal transfers, checking balances of assets held by the contract.
7.  **Scheduled & Conditional Execution:** Defining and triggering tasks based on time and custom data/logic.
8.  **Proof-Based Interactions:** Verifying Merkle proofs or custom "interaction proofs" to unlock actions.
9.  **Time-Locked Assets:** Locking assets until a specific timestamp.
10. **Specific ERC-721 Right Delegation:** Assigning and checking custom arbitrary 'rights' associated with NFTs held by the contract.
11. **Permissioned Actions:** Defining actions that require a specific signature or authorization to execute.
12. **External Logic & Calls:** Configuring and executing calls to other contracts based on internal logic or configuration.

**Function Summary (Total: 26 Functions):**

1.  `initialize()`: (Conceptual) Placeholder for upgradeable contract initialization.
2.  `setAdmin(address admin, bool status)`: Grant or revoke admin status (can manage permissions, rescue).
3.  `pauseContract()`: Pause all non-admin-specific operations.
4.  `unpauseContract()`: Unpause the contract.
5.  `rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Rescue specified ERC-20 tokens from the contract (admin only).
6.  `rescueERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Rescue specified ERC-721 token from the contract (admin only).
7.  `getERC20Balance(address tokenAddress, address account)`: Get the balance of a specific ERC-20 token *held by this contract* for a given user's internal accounting.
8.  `getERC721Owner(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Get the owner of an ERC-721 token *held by this contract* (internal accounting).
9.  `depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Deposit ERC-20 tokens into the contract's custody.

12. `withdrawERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Withdraw a previously deposited ERC-721 token.
13. `scheduleConditionalTransfer(address tokenAddress, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes conditionData, uint256 validUntil)`: Schedule an ERC-20 transfer that can only be executed before `validUntil` and potentially based on `conditionData` verification.
14. `executeScheduledTransfer(uint256 scheduleId, bytes executionData)`: Attempt to execute a scheduled transfer, potentially using `executionData` to fulfill the condition.
15. `revokeScheduledTransfer(uint256 scheduleId)`: Cancel a pending scheduled transfer (only by scheduler or admin).
16. `storeMerkleRoot(bytes32 root)`: Store a Merkle root hash on-chain for future verification (admin/permissioned).
17. `verifyMerkleProofAndClaim(bytes32 root, bytes32 leaf, bytes32[] calldata proof, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Verify a Merkle proof against a stored root and, if valid, allow claiming a specific amount of tokens.
18. `submitInteractionProof(bytes32 proofHash, address user, uint256 value)`: Submit a unique hash representing an off-chain or complex on-chain interaction proof, linking it to a user and value.
19. `claimWithInteractionProof(bytes32 proofHash, address tokenAddress)`: Claim assets based on a previously submitted and verified interaction proof hash.
20. `createTimeLock(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint256 unlockTime)`: Create a time lock for a specified amount of tokens.
21. `withdrawTimeLocked(uint256 lockId)`: Withdraw tokens from a time lock once the unlock time has passed.
22. `delegateERC721Right(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId, address delegatee, bytes32 rightKey)`: Delegate a custom arbitrary right associated with an NFT held by the contract to another address.
23. `revokeERC721Right(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId, bytes32 rightKey)`: Revoke a delegated ERC-721 right.
24. `checkERC721Right(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId, address delegatee, bytes32 rightKey)`: Check if a specific right has been delegated for an NFT.
25. `createPermissionedAction(bytes32 actionId, address designatedSigner, bytes32 actionHash)`: Define an action that requires a specific signer's authorization hash to execute.
26. `executePermissionedAction(bytes32 actionId, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)`: Execute a permissioned action by providing the signature from the designated signer.
