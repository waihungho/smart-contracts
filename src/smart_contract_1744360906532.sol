 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI (Conceptual Contract - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, featuring advanced concepts
 *       like dynamic membership, curated NFT drops, collaborative art creation, decentralized governance,
 *       and integration with metaverse exhibitions.

 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **Membership & Governance:**
 * 1. joinCollective(string _artistName, string _artistStatement, string _portfolioLink): Allows artists to apply for membership, subject to voting.
 * 2. leaveCollective(): Allows members to voluntarily leave the collective.
 * 3. proposeNewMember(address _newArtistAddress, string _artistName, string _artistStatement, string _portfolioLink): Members can propose new artists for membership.
 * 4. voteOnMembershipProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on pending membership proposals.
 * 5. proposeRuleChange(string _description, bytes _data): Allows members to propose changes to collective rules/parameters.
 * 6. voteOnRuleChangeProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on rule change proposals.
 * 7. executeRuleChangeProposal(uint _proposalId): Executes a passed rule change proposal. (Requires majority and quorum).
 * 8. getMemberCount(): Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 * 9. getMembershipProposalDetails(uint _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific membership proposal.
 * 10. getRuleChangeProposalDetails(uint _proposalId): Retrieves details of a specific rule change proposal.

 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 11. submitArt(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint _editionSize, uint _price): Members submit their artwork for potential NFT minting and collective drops.
 * 12. voteOnArtSubmission(uint _submissionId, bool _vote): Members vote on submitted artwork for curation into collective NFT drops.
 * 13. finalizeArtSubmission(uint _submissionId): Finalizes an approved art submission, minting NFTs and preparing for a collective drop.
 * 14. getRandomApprovedArtSubmission(): Returns details of a randomly selected approved art submission (for spotlight or promotion).
 * 15. getArtSubmissionDetails(uint _submissionId): Retrieves details of a specific art submission.

 * **Collaborative Art & Metaverse Integration:**
 * 16. createCollaborativeCanvas(string _canvasName, uint _width, uint _height): Allows members to propose and create a collaborative digital canvas.
 * 17. contributeToCanvas(uint _canvasId, uint _x, uint _y, uint _color): Members can contribute pixels to approved collaborative canvases.
 * 18. mintCanvasAsNFT(uint _canvasId): Allows minting a finalized collaborative canvas as an NFT, with revenue shared among contributors.
 * 19. scheduleMetaverseExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _metaverseLocation, uint _startTime, uint _endTime, uint[] _artSubmissionIds): Members can propose and schedule metaverse exhibitions featuring curated art.
 * 20. getCollectiveTreasuryBalance(): Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 * 21. withdrawFromTreasury(uint _amount, address _recipient): Allows members to propose withdrawals from the collective treasury (governance controlled).
 * 22. proposeTreasuryWithdrawal(uint _amount, address _recipient, string _reason):  Members propose treasury withdrawals, subject to voting.
 * 23. voteOnTreasuryWithdrawal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on treasury withdrawal proposals.
 * 24. executeTreasuryWithdrawal(uint _proposalId): Executes a passed treasury withdrawal proposal.

 * **Events:**
 * - MembershipRequested: Emitted when an artist requests to join.
 * - MemberJoined: Emitted when an artist becomes a member.
 * - MemberLeft: Emitted when a member leaves.
 * - MembershipProposalCreated: Emitted when a new membership proposal is created.
 * - MembershipProposalVoted: Emitted when a member votes on a membership proposal.
 * - RuleChangeProposalCreated: Emitted when a new rule change proposal is created.
 * - RuleChangeProposalVoted: Emitted when a member votes on a rule change proposal.
 * - RuleChangeExecuted: Emitted when a rule change proposal is executed.
 * - ArtSubmitted: Emitted when art is submitted for curation.
 * - ArtSubmissionVoted: Emitted when a member votes on an art submission.
 * - ArtSubmissionFinalized: Emitted when an art submission is finalized and NFTs are minted.
 * - CollaborativeCanvasCreated: Emitted when a collaborative canvas is created.
 * - CanvasContribution: Emitted when a member contributes to a collaborative canvas.
 * - CanvasMintedAsNFT: Emitted when a collaborative canvas is minted as an NFT.
 * - MetaverseExhibitionScheduled: Emitted when a metaverse exhibition is scheduled.
 * - TreasuryWithdrawalProposed: Emitted when a treasury withdrawal proposal is created.
 * - TreasuryWithdrawalVoted: Emitted when a member votes on a treasury withdrawal proposal.
 * - TreasuryWithdrawalExecuted: Emitted when a treasury withdrawal proposal is executed.
