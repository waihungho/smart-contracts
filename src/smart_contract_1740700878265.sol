/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation and Prediction Market (DRPM)
 * @author Gemini (This is a generative AI, treat the code with caution)
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized system for managing reputation scores and
 *  integrating them into a prediction market focused on future outcomes.  It introduces the concept of
 *  decaying reputation, where reputation scores gradually diminish over time if not actively maintained
 *  through successful predictions. This incentivizes continuous engagement and accurate forecasting.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *  1.  **Reputation Management:**
 *      -   Handles the awarding, subtracting, and decay of reputation scores.
 *      -   Utilizes a time-based decay mechanism.
 *  2.  **Prediction Market:**
 *      -   Allows users to predict the outcome of a defined event within a specified timeframe.
 *      -   Leverages reputation as a weight/multiplier on potential payouts. Higher reputation yields higher rewards for correct predictions.
 *  3.  **Event Resolution:**
 *      -   An admin can resolve an event, distributing rewards based on prediction accuracy and reputation.
 *
 *  **Function Summary:**
 *  -   `constructor(uint256 _decayRate, uint256 _eventDuration)`: Initializes the contract with decay rate and event duration parameters.
 *  -   `updateReputation(address user, int256 reputationChange)`:  Adjusts a user's reputation score, subject to limits. Only callable by the contract itself or a trusted role.
 *  -   `decayReputation(address user)`: Reduces a user's reputation score based on the time elapsed since their last decay and the defined decay rate.  Can be called by anyone.
 *  -   `predictEvent(uint256 eventId, bool prediction) external payable`: Allows a user to place a prediction on an event, staking ETH.
 *  -   `resolveEvent(uint256 eventId, bool actualOutcome) external onlyOwner`:  Resolves an event, paying out rewards to correct predictors, weighted by reputation.
 *  -   `getReputation(address user) external view returns (int256)`: Returns the current reputation score of a user.
 *  -   `getEventDetails(uint256 eventId) external view returns (bool isOpen, bool outcome, uint256 totalStaked)`: Returns details about an event.
 *  -   `withdrawStuckEther() external onlyOwner`: Allows the owner to withdraw any Ether stuck in the contract.
 *  -   `setDecayRate(uint256 _decayRate) external onlyOwner`: Allows the owner to set the decay rate.
 *  -   `setEventDuration(uint256 _eventDuration) external onlyOwner`: Allows the owner to set the event duration.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Decaying Reputation:** The `decayReputation` function gradually reduces a user's reputation over time, incentivizing participation. It calculates the decay based on `decayRate` and the time since the last decay. Crucially, it *prevents* the decay from dropping the reputation below `MIN_REPUTATION`.  This is a much more robust implementation than a simple subtraction.
* **Reputation Caps:** The `updateReputation` function enforces `MAX_REPUTATION` and `MIN_REPUTATION`, preventing reputation scores from becoming unbounded.
* **Reputation as a Prediction Multiplier:** The `resolveEvent` function incorporates reputation into the reward calculation.  Users with higher reputations receive a bonus on their winnings.  This encourages accurate predictions and long-term engagement.  It uses `effectiveReputation` to only reward positive reputations.
* **Event Structure and Management:**
    * `Event` and `Prediction` structs organize event data.
    * `events` mapping stores events by ID.
    * `eventCounter` tracks the number of events.
    * The `eventExists` modifier prevents interactions with non-existent or resolved events.
    * `createEvent` function allows the owner to initiate new events.
* **Minimum Stake:**  The `MINIMUM_STAKE` constant and the `require` statement in `predictEvent` prevent users from gaming the system with trivial bets.
* **Clear Event Resolution:**  The `resolveEvent` function now correctly calculates and distributes rewards based on the proportion of stake of correct predictions, including the reputation bonus. It *transfers* the reward to the correct predictors. Crucially, it uses `payable(predictor).transfer(reward)` to actually send the Ether.
* **Security Enhancements:**
    * **Ownership:** The `onlyOwner` modifier restricts sensitive functions (resolution, withdrawal, parameter updates) to the contract owner.
    * **Stuck Ether Withdrawal:**  `withdrawStuckEther` allows the owner to recover accidentally sent Ether.
    * **Input Validation:**  `require` statements validate inputs to prevent errors and exploits.
    * **Reentrancy Guard (Not Explicit, but Considerations):**  While *not* explicitly included (for brevity), in a real-world deployment, you'd want to add a reentrancy guard using a library like OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent malicious contracts from draining the contract during payout.  This is critically important when dealing with `transfer`.  If the recipient of the transferred ether is a malicious smart contract, that contract can call back into the smart contract before the transfer function finishes executing and potentially drain the contract.

* **Clearer Code Structure and Comments:**  The code is well-structured with comments explaining the purpose of each function and variable.  Uses Natspec-style documentation.
* **Events:**  Emits events for important actions (reputation updates, predictions, event resolution) for off-chain monitoring and auditing.
* **Parameter Updates:** The owner can now update the `decayRate` and `eventDuration` via dedicated functions.
* **Reputation Award Amount proportional to stake** `reputationAwardAmount` is calculated based on the stake, so larger stakes result in larger reputation bonuses.
* **Gas Considerations:**  The contract uses mappings, which are gas-efficient for lookups but can be expensive for iteration.  Consider limiting the number of participants per event to control gas costs.  Also, the decay rate is now per hour, reducing the frequency of decay calculations and saving gas.
* **Error Handling:** The `require` statements provide informative error messages to the user.

How to use the contract:

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the `DRPM` contract with appropriate initial `decayRate` and `eventDuration` values.
2.  **Create Events:** The owner uses `createEvent()` to create new events. The function returns the ID of the new event.
3.  **Predict:** Users call `predictEvent` with the event ID and their prediction (true/false), staking ETH.
4.  **Resolve:**  After the event duration has passed, the owner calls `resolveEvent` with the event ID and the actual outcome. The contract distributes rewards.
5.  **Monitor:**  Use the emitted events to track reputation changes, predictions, and event resolutions.  Use `getReputation` and `getEventDetails` to query contract state.

This improved version is more secure, functional, and realistic than the original, providing a solid foundation for a decentralized reputation and prediction market. Remember to thoroughly test any smart contract before deploying it to a live network.  Consider a full security audit.
