/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Research Organization (DARO) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for managing a decentralized research organization.
 * It incorporates advanced concepts like decentralized governance, research proposal management,
 * decentralized data storage integration (simulated), reputation system, milestone-based funding,
 * and more, aiming to be a comprehensive platform for collaborative and transparent research.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Governance & Membership:**
 *    - `initializeDARO(string _name, address[] _initialMembers)`: Initializes the DARO with a name and initial members.
 *    - `proposeGovernanceChange(string _description, bytes _data)`: Allows members to propose changes to governance parameters.
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on governance change proposals.
 *    - `executeGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId)`: Executes approved governance changes.
 *    - `addMember(address _newMember)`: Allows adding new members through governance vote.
 *    - `removeMember(address _memberToRemove)`: Allows removing members through governance vote.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a member.
 *
 * **2. Research Proposal Management:**
 *    - `submitResearchProposal(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint[] _milestoneTimestamps, uint[] _milestoneBudgets)`: Members submit research proposals with milestones and budget.
 *    - `voteOnResearchProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on research proposals.
 *    - `fundResearchProposal(uint _proposalId)`: Funds an approved research proposal if enough balance is available.
 *    - `submitResearchMilestoneUpdate(uint _proposalId, uint _milestoneIndex, string _updateDescription, string _ipfsHash)`: Researchers submit updates for milestones.
 *    - `voteOnMilestoneCompletion(uint _proposalId, uint _milestoneIndex, bool _completed)`: Members vote on milestone completion.
 *    - `releaseMilestonePayment(uint _proposalId, uint _milestoneIndex)`: Releases payment for completed and approved milestones.
 *    - `cancelResearchProposal(uint _proposalId)`: Allows cancelling a research proposal (governance vote required).
 *    - `getResearchProposalDetails(uint _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a research proposal.
 *
 * **3. Reputation & Incentive System:**
 *    - `upvoteMember(address _member)`: Members can upvote other members, increasing their reputation.
 *    - `downvoteMember(address _member)`: Members can downvote other members, decreasing their reputation.
 *    - `rewardActiveContributor(address _member, string _reason)`:  Owner/Admin can reward active contributors (e.g., with reputation points, potential future token).
 *
 * **4. Decentralized Data & Access Control (Simulated IPFS):**
 *    - `storeDataIPFS(string _data)`:  Simulates storing data on IPFS and returns a hash (for demonstration).
 *    - `retrieveDataIPFS(string _ipfsHash)`: Simulates retrieving data from IPFS using a hash (for demonstration).
 *
 * **5. Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *    - `setGovernanceThreshold(uint _newThreshold)`: Owner can change the governance voting threshold.
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Owner can pause the contract in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Owner can unpause the contract.
 *    - `withdrawFunds(address payable _recipient, uint _amount)`: Owner can withdraw excess contract funds.

**Explanation of the Smart Contract: Decentralized Autonomous Research Organization (DARO)**

This Solidity smart contract outlines a Decentralized Autonomous Research Organization (DARO). It's designed to manage the entire lifecycle of research proposals, from submission and voting to funding, milestone tracking, and reputation management, all in a decentralized and transparent manner.

**Key Features and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized Governance:**
    *   **Governance Proposals:** Members can propose changes to the DARO's rules and parameters (e.g., adding/removing members, changing voting thresholds).
    *   **Voting Mechanism:** A percentage-based voting system (governanceThreshold) determines if a proposal passes. Members can vote on governance changes and research proposals.
    *   **Execution of Changes:** Approved governance proposals can trigger on-chain actions within the contract itself, demonstrating a level of self-governance.

2.  **Research Proposal Lifecycle Management:**
    *   **Submission:** Members can submit detailed research proposals, including milestones, budgets, and links to decentralized storage (simulated with IPFS).
    *   **Voting on Proposals:** The DARO members vote on whether to fund research proposals.
    *   **Milestone-Based Funding:** Research projects are broken down into milestones with defined budgets. Funding is released incrementally upon successful completion and approval of each milestone, reducing risk and ensuring accountability.
    *   **Milestone Tracking:** The contract tracks the status of each milestone (Pending, Submitted, Under Review, Completed, Paid).
    *   **Decentralized Data Integration (Simulated):**  The contract uses IPFS hash references to simulate storing research documents and deliverables on decentralized storage. Functions `storeDataIPFS` and `retrieveDataIPFS` are mock implementations for demonstration.

3.  **Reputation System:**
    *   **Member Reputation:**  Each member has a reputation score, initially set to 0.
    *   **Upvoting and Downvoting:** Members can upvote or downvote each other, influencing reputation. This can be used to recognize valuable contributors and potentially influence governance weight in a more advanced system.
    *   **Admin Rewards:** The owner can reward active contributors with reputation bonuses.

4.  **Membership Management:**
    *   **Member Roles:** The contract differentiates between members (who can participate in governance and research) and the contract owner (who has administrative privileges like pausing and setting governance thresholds).
    *   **Adding and Removing Members:** Membership changes are governed by DAO votes, ensuring decentralized control over who participates in the organization.

5.  **Security and Utility Features:**
    *   **Pausable Contract:** An emergency stop mechanism (`pauseContract` and `unpauseContract`) controlled by the owner, allowing for halting contract operations in critical situations.
    *   **Ownable Contract:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` to manage contract ownership and owner-restricted functions.
    *   **Withdraw Funds:** The owner can withdraw excess funds from the contract, useful for managing the contract's balance.
    *   **Receive Ether Function:**  The contract can receive Ether, allowing it to be funded for research projects.

**Trendy and Advanced Concepts Incorporated:**

*   **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):**  The core concept is building a self-governing research organization.
*   **Decentralized Governance:**  Implementing voting and proposal mechanisms for community-driven decision-making.
*   **Decentralized Data Storage (IPFS Simulation):**  Integrating with decentralized storage solutions (conceptually) for research data management.
*   **Reputation Systems:**  Using reputation as a soft form of governance and incentive mechanism.
*   **Milestone-Based Funding:**  A more secure and accountable approach to project funding, common in modern project management and adaptable to blockchain for transparency.
*   **On-chain Execution of Governance Actions:** Demonstrating the ability of the contract to react to governance votes by modifying its own state and behavior.

**Non-Duplication from Open Source:**

While many open-source contracts deal with DAOs, governance, and funding, this example aims to combine these concepts in a specific context (research organization) and with a unique set of functions and features. It's not a direct clone of any particular open-source project but rather a creative application of blockchain principles.

**Further Enhancements (Beyond the scope but ideas for expansion):**

*   **Tokenization:** Introduce a DARO governance token that members could earn or stake for increased voting power or other benefits.
*   **Advanced Reputation Metrics:**  Implement more sophisticated reputation algorithms, potentially based on on-chain activity, peer reviews, or other factors.
*   **Real IPFS Integration:**  Replace the simulated IPFS functions with actual integration with an IPFS library or gateway.
*   **External Oracles:**  Use oracles for real-world data integration, potentially for research data validation or external triggers.
*   **Sub-DAOs or Working Groups:** Allow for the creation of smaller, specialized groups within the DARO for focused research areas.
*   **AI/ML Integration (Future Concept):** Explore how AI/ML could be integrated into the DARO for tasks like proposal review, data analysis, or research recommendations (a very advanced and future-oriented concept).

This contract provides a solid foundation for a decentralized research organization and demonstrates several advanced blockchain concepts in a practical and creative way. Remember that this is a conceptual example and would require thorough security audits, testing, and potentially further development for real-world deployment.
