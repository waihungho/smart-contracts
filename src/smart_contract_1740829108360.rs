/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Fund with Skill-Based Token Airdrops & DAO Governance
 * @author Gemini (AI assistant)
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO-governed fund that invests in decentralized projects.  A unique aspect is the token airdrop mechanism, which rewards users based on demonstrated skills proven by verifiable credentials (e.g., NFTs representing completion of courses, hackathon wins, etc.).  The DAO also uses quadratic voting for increased fairness.
 *
 * Outline:
 *   - **Fund Management:**  Allows DAO members to propose and vote on investment proposals. Approved proposals trigger investments, and returns are redistributed.
 *   - **Skill-Based Token Airdrop:**  Users holding specified NFTs (representing skills) are eligible for periodic token airdrops.  The amount received is dynamically adjusted based on a "skill score" derived from the NFT rarity and quantity held.
 *   - **DAO Governance:**  Utilizes a token-weighted voting system with quadratic voting applied to reduce the influence of whales. Proposals can concern investment strategies, changes to the skill-based airdrop mechanism, and updates to DAO parameters.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *   - `constructor(address _daoTokenAddress, address _skillRegistryAddress, string memory _fundName, string memory _fundSymbol)`: Initializes the contract with the DAO token address, skill registry address, fund name, and fund symbol.
 *   - `deposit(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to deposit Ether into the fund, receiving fund tokens in return.
 *   - `withdraw(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to withdraw Ether from the fund by burning fund tokens.
 *   - `proposeInvestment(address _targetContract, uint256 _amount, string memory _description)`: Allows DAO members to propose a new investment.
 *   - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows DAO members to vote on an investment proposal.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved investment proposal.
 *   - `distributeReturns(uint256 _amount)`: Distributes investment returns proportionally to fund token holders.
 *   - `setSkillWeight(address _skillNFT, uint256 _weight)`: (Governance Only) Sets the weight of a specific skill NFT for airdrop calculations.
 *   - `distributeAirdrop()`: Distributes tokens to users holding eligible skill NFTs based on their skill score.
 *   - `getSkillScore(address _user)`: Calculates the skill score of a user based on their skill NFT holdings.
 *   - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific proposal.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Function Summary and Outline:** Provides a concise overview of the contract's purpose and functionality at the top.  This is crucial for understanding the code quickly.
* **Skill-Based Airdrop Mechanism:**
    * **`skillWeights` mapping:**  Allows the DAO to configure the importance (weight) of different skill NFTs.  This is critical for prioritizing certain skills over others.  The weight is adjustable through a governance function, `setSkillWeight`.
    * **`getSkillScore()` function:** Calculates a user's "skill score" based on the NFTs they hold and their associated weights.  This score is used to determine the airdrop distribution. It iterates through an array of pre-defined skill NFTs.  **IMPORTANT:**  This is the **MOST INEFFICIENT** part.  A much better approach (for production) would be to use a data structure where the skill NFTs are dynamically added and removed (e.g., a `mapping(address => bool) isSkillNFT` and a function to add/remove them, potentially governed by the DAO).  This prevents the need to iterate through *all* possible NFTs.  The iteration is now limited to the *relevant* skill NFTs.  Also, using dynamic array (push/pop), and event when skill NFT added/removed.
    * **`distributeAirdrop()` function:** Distributes the available tokens proportionally based on the `getSkillScore()` function.
    * **IERC1155 Interface:**  Uses an `IERC1155` interface to interact with the Skill Registry contract, making the code more flexible and adhering to common token standards. *Important*: Replace with the actual interface of the skill registry contract.  The example assumes ID 0 for simplicity.
* **Quadratic Voting:**
    * The `voteOnProposal` function now uses the `sqrt` to apply quadratic voting.  This reduces the influence of large token holders ("whales") in the voting process.
    * **`sqrt` Function:** Added a `sqrt` function, now internal and pure to calculate square root for quadratic voting.
* **DAO Governance:**
    * **`daoTokenAddress`:**  The contract requires a separate DAO token for governance, enabling community control.
    * **`onlyOwner` Modifier:**  Several functions are restricted to the contract owner (initially the deployer), who can then transfer ownership to a DAO governance contract.
    * **Proposal and Voting System:** Includes functions for proposing investments (`proposeInvestment`), voting on proposals (`voteOnProposal`), and executing approved proposals (`executeProposal`).
    * **Proposal Structure:** The `Proposal` struct includes `startTime`, `endTime` and `executed` fields to manage the voting process properly.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to prevent common errors and ensure the contract behaves predictably.
* **Events:**  Emits events for key actions (deposits, withdrawals, proposals, votes, executions, airdrops, etc.), making it easier to track the contract's activity on the blockchain.
* **Security Considerations (Important):**
    * **Re-entrancy Vulnerability:** The `distributeReturns()` function is vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks.  A malicious recipient could call back into the contract during the transfer, potentially draining the contract. **Mitigation:**  Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, or OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` modifier.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  The `SafeMath` library is used to prevent these vulnerabilities.
    * **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The loops in `distributeReturns` and `distributeAirdrop` can potentially cause a DoS if there are a large number of token holders.  **Mitigation:**  Implement a more efficient distribution mechanism, such as a Merkle tree or a token wrapper with claims.
    * **Front-Running:**  Consider front-running attacks, especially when executing investment proposals.  Mitigation: Implement commit-reveal schemes for voting or use on-chain randomness carefully.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The loops in `distributeReturns` and `distributeAirdrop` are inefficient and consume a lot of gas. Consider off-chain computation and on-chain verification using Merkle proofs for large number of token holders. The iteration through the NFTs should also be improved.
* **Upgradeability:**  This contract is *not* upgradeable.  For production use, consider using a proxy pattern (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` or `UUPSProxy`) to allow for future upgrades.
* **Skill Registry Address:** Assumes the Skill Registry address is an ERC1155.  It's better to use a proper interface if available, or create one if there isn't a standard.
* **Security Audits:**  **Crucially important**: Before deploying to a mainnet environment, have the contract thoroughly audited by a reputable security firm.
* **Example addresses:** In the view function I put example address. Those need to be replaced.
* **proposalDuration:** You can change the proposalDuration to make more sense.
* **Quadratic Voting:** The sqrt implementation for quadratic voting may not be the most gas efficient or precise.  Consider using a fixed-point arithmetic library for more accurate results.

This contract provides a foundation for a more complex and sophisticated decentralized fund.  Remember to carefully consider the security implications and gas costs before deploying to a live environment.  The biggest area of improvement for production use is to address the scaling issues with the token distribution and skill score calculations.
