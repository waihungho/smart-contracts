This smart contract, `CerebralBloomProtocol`, envisions a decentralized ecosystem where user contributions (potentially real-world data, actions, or verifiable claims) are assessed by an AI oracle, leading to the issuance of "Synergy Points" (SP) tokens and the evolution of dynamic "Cognitive Bloom" NFTs. It integrates concepts of AI-driven rewards, dynamic NFTs, ZK-proof integration (as a placeholder), and a lightweight governance model, ensuring its functions are both advanced and novel.

Please note: For brevity and focus on the advanced concepts, the ERC-20 and ERC-721 implementations within this contract are simplified subsets. In a production environment, it is highly recommended to use the robust and audited implementations from OpenZeppelin Contracts. The ZK-proof verification is also a placeholder, as full on-chain ZK verification is highly complex and typically involves dedicated verifier contracts or precompiled contracts.

**Outline: CerebralBloomProtocol - An AI-Driven Eco-Synergy Framework**

This protocol aims to decentralize the assessment and reward of synergistic contributions, potentially tied to real-world data or complex on-chain interactions. It integrates AI oracle capabilities, dynamic NFTs, a unique reputation/growth system, and a lightweight governance model.

**Function Summary:**

1.  **Core Configuration & Access Control:**
    *   `constructor`: Initializes the contract owner, sets up the initial treasury address, and pre-configures milestone rewards.
    *   `setAIOracleAddress`: Configures the trusted address of the off-chain AI Oracle contract.
    *   `pauseProtocol`: Pauses core functionalities in emergencies or for upgrades.
    *   `unpauseProtocol`: Resumes core functionalities.

2.  **Synergy Point (SP) Token Management (ERC-20 Standard Subset):**
    *   `_mintSynergyPoints`: Internal function to create new SP tokens, primarily called after a successful AI assessment.
    *   `totalSupply`: Returns the total amount of SP tokens in existence.
    *   `balanceOf`: Returns the SP token balance of any account.
    *   `transfer`: Allows an account to send SP tokens to another.
    *   `approve`: Allows an account to set an allowance for a third party to spend its SP tokens.
    *   `allowance`: Returns the amount of SP tokens that a spender is allowed to withdraw from an owner.
    *   `transferFrom`: Allows a third party to transfer SP tokens from one account to another using an allowance.

3.  **Cognitive Bloom NFT Management (ERC-721 Standard Subset, Dynamic & Generative):**
    *   `mintCognitiveBloom`: Mints a new dynamic Cognitive Bloom NFT for a user, initializing its attributes.
    *   `updateBloomAttributes`: Internal function to evolve an NFT's attributes (growth score, genesis seed) based on protocol events (e.g., AI assessment).
    *   `getBloomGrowthScore`: Retrieves the accumulated "growth score" for a specific Bloom NFT, reflecting its evolution.
    *   `tokenURI`: Dynamically generates the metadata URI for a Bloom NFT, allowing its visual or data representation to change based on on-chain attributes.
    *   `balanceOf(address owner)`: Returns the number of NFTs owned by a given address.
    *   `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the owner of the given NFT.
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfers an NFT safely, checking if the recipient is an ERC721 receiver.
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data)`: Overloaded safe transfer function.
    *   `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfers an NFT without recipient checks.
    *   `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Approves an address to take ownership of a specific NFT.
    *   `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the approved address for a single NFT.
    *   `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Allows an operator to manage all NFTs owned by the caller.
    *   `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`: Checks if an operator is approved for all NFTs of an owner.

4.  **AI-Driven Data Claims & Assessment Integration:**
    *   `submitSynergyClaim`: Users submit a hashed claim (e.g., environmental data) along with a placeholder for a Zero-Knowledge Proof, triggering an AI assessment request.
    *   `_requestAIAssessment`: Internal function that dispatches the assessment request to the configured AI Oracle.
    *   `fulfillAIAssessment`: The authorized callback function for the AI Oracle to deliver the assessment score, which then triggers SP minting and NFT updates.
    *   `verifyZKProofForClaim`: A pure placeholder function that would, in a real system, verify a cryptographic zero-knowledge proof for data integrity.

5.  **Decentralized Governance & Treasury Management:**
    *   `proposeProtocolParameterChange`: Allows SP token holders to propose changes to contract parameters via a vote.
    *   `voteOnProposal`: Allows SP token holders to vote "for" or "against" active proposals, with voting power proportional to their SP balance.
    *   `executeProposal`: Executes a governance proposal that has successfully passed its voting period and met the quorum and approval thresholds.
    *   `depositFundsIntoTreasury`: Allows anyone to contribute native blockchain currency (e.g., Ether) to the protocol's treasury.
    *   `withdrawTreasuryFunds`: A governance-controlled function to withdraw funds from the treasury for protocol operations.

6.  **Gamification & Progression System:**
    *   `claimSynergyMilestone`: Allows users to claim predefined SP rewards once their cumulative synergy score (reflected in SP balance) reaches certain thresholds.
    *   `getSynergyMilestoneStatus`: Checks if a user has claimed a specific milestone reward.
    *   `resetUserSynergyMetrics`: (Governance-controlled) A sensitive function to reset a user's claimed milestones, potentially for seasonal campaigns or rectifying abuse.

7.  **Advanced Features & Maintenance:**
    *   `emergencyShutdown`: A high-privilege function for the owner to halt critical protocol operations in extreme circumstances.
    *   `setMinimumSynergyClaimValue`: A governance-controlled parameter to set the minimum AI score required for a claim to be rewarded, preventing spam.
    *   `receive()`: Fallback function to enable the contract to receive native blockchain currency.
