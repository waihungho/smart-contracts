/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - for illustrative purposes only, not production-ready)
 * @dev This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) where members can collectively curate,
 *      manage, and benefit from a collection of digital artworks (NFTs). It introduces advanced concepts like:
 *      - Dynamic Membership tiers and voting power based on contribution.
 *      - Curatorial voting and decentralized artwork acquisition.
 *      - Collaborative artwork creation and revenue sharing.
 *      - On-chain reputation system for members.
 *      - Time-locked voting and proposal execution.
 *      - Decentralized exhibition and lending features.
 *      - Advanced governance parameters and upgrades.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art NFT Management:**
 *    - `mintArtNFT(string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows authorized members to mint new Art NFTs, associating them with metadata.
 *    - `transferArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`: Allows NFT owners to transfer their Art NFTs.
 *    - `getArtNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the metadata URI associated with an Art NFT.
 *    - `getArtistOfArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the address of the artist who minted a specific Art NFT.
 *    - `burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the DAAC (through governance) to burn an Art NFT (e.g., if deemed inappropriate).
 *
 * **2. DAAC Membership & Governance:**
 *    - `requestMembership(string memory _reason)`: Allows users to request membership to the DAAC, stating their reason for joining.
 *    - `approveMembership(address _applicant)`: Allows existing members to vote to approve a membership application.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows existing members to vote to revoke a member's DAAC access.
 *    - `getMemberTier(address _member)`: Retrieves the membership tier of a DAAC member.
 *    - `getMemberVotingPower(address _member)`: Calculates the voting power of a member based on their tier and contribution.
 *    - `updateGovernanceParameters(uint256 _quorumPercentage, uint256 _votingDuration)`: Allows governance to update key parameters of the DAAC.
 *
 * **3. Curatorial & Artwork Acquisition:**
 *    - `proposeArtworkAcquisition(string memory _metadataURI, uint256 _priceInETH)`: Allows members to propose acquiring a new artwork for the DAAC collection.
 *    - `voteOnArtworkAcquisition(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows members to vote on an artwork acquisition proposal.
 *    - `executeArtworkAcquisition(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved artwork acquisition proposal, purchasing the NFT.
 *    - `viewArtworkAcquisitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of an artwork acquisition proposal.
 *
 * **4. Collaborative Art & Revenue Sharing:**
 *    - `proposeCollaborativeArtwork(string memory _metadataURI, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Allows members to propose creating a collaborative artwork.
 *    - `setCollaborativeArtworkRevenueShares(uint256 _tokenId, uint256[] memory _shares)`: Allows defining revenue shares for collaborators of a collaborative artwork.
 *    - `distributeArtworkRevenue(uint256 _tokenId)`: Distributes revenue generated from an artwork (e.g., from exhibitions or sales) to collaborators and the DAAC treasury.
 *
 * **5. Reputation & Incentive System:**
 *    - `contributeToDAAC(string memory _contributionDetails)`: Allows members to log their contributions to the DAAC, potentially influencing their reputation.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves a member's reputation score (dynamically calculated based on contributions and positive votes).
 *    - `rewardMember(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows governance to reward members for exceptional contributions from the DAAC treasury.
 *
 * **6. Decentralized Exhibition & Lending (Conceptual - requires further external integration):**
 *    - `proposeArtworkExhibition(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _exhibitionDetails)`: Allows members to propose exhibiting an artwork.
 *    - `lendArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId, address _borrower, uint256 _rentalFee, uint256 _duration)`: Allows the DAAC to lend out an Art NFT for a fee and duration (conceptual - requires external mechanism for enforcement).
 *
 * **7. Utility & Security Functions:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Allows the contract owner to pause critical functions in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Allows the contract owner to unpause the contract.
 *    - `emergencyWithdrawFunds()`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw stuck ETH in case of unforeseen issues (emergency use only).
