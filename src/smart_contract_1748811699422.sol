Okay, let's design a smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Artistic Guild (DAAG). This contract will manage membership, reputation, collaborative artistic projects, funding for those projects, and governance over the guild's rules and activities, including resource allocation and member standing.

It incorporates concepts like:
*   DAO structure with on-chain governance.
*   Reputation system influencing voting power and privileges.
*   Project lifecycle management (proposal, funding, completion).
*   Delegation of voting power.
*   Dynamic guild parameters controlled by governance.
*   Internal token-like mechanics (reputation, project shares) without being a standard ERC20/721.
*   Treasury management.

This is a complex system, and a real-world implementation would likely involve multiple contracts (e.g., separate ERC721 for project outputs, potentially a separate governance module). For this example, we'll keep the core logic within a single contract for demonstration, focusing on the interactions and state management.

**Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `DecentralizedAutonomousArtisticGuild`

**Core Concepts:**
1.  **Members:** Users can join the guild, gain reputation, and participate in activities.
2.  **Reputation:** An internal, non-transferable score reflecting a member's contribution and standing. Influences voting power and proposal ability.
3.  **Projects:** Proposals for collaborative artistic endeavors that require funding and member contributions.
4.  **Funding:** Mechanism for members (or others) to contribute Ether/tokens to specific projects or the general guild treasury.
5.  **Governance:** Proposal and voting system allowing members to make decisions on projects, rules, reputation updates, and treasury usage.
6.  **Treasury:** Holds collected funds (joining fees, project surpluses, donations) manageable via governance.
7.  **Delegation:** Members can delegate their voting power to others.

**Enums:**
*   `ProjectStatus`: Proposed, Funding, Completed, Failed
*   `ProposalType`: FundProject, MarkProjectComplete, UpdateReputation, ChangeParameter, DistributeTreasury, CustomCall
*   `ProposalState`: Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed, Executed, Cancelled

**Structs:**
*   `Member`: address, reputation, joinTimestamp, active, votingDelegate
*   `Project`: id, creator, title, description, fundingGoal, currentFunding, status, creationTimestamp
*   `Proposal`: id, proposer, description, type, targetContract, callData, value, startTimestamp, endTimestamp, yesVotes, noVotes, executed, cancelled, projectId, memberAddress (for reputation updates), reputationChange, parameterKey, parameterValue, voterHasVoted, delegationMapping

**State Variables:**
*   Counters for members, projects, proposals.
*   Mappings for members, projects, proposals.
*   Mapping for project contributors.
*   Mapping for project shares/claims.
*   Mapping for dynamic guild parameters.
*   Treasury balance (implicitly `address(this).balance`).

**Functions (Approx 30+):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the guild parameters and potentially an initial admin/governor.
2.  `joinGuild()`: Allows a user to become a member (potentially with requirements like a fee or minimum reputation outside the guild).
3.  `leaveGuild()`: Allows a member to leave the guild.
4.  `isGuildMember(address memberAddress) view`: Checks if an address is currently an active member.
5.  `getMemberInfo(address memberAddress) view`: Retrieves detailed information about a member.
6.  `getReputation(address memberAddress) view`: Gets the current reputation score for a member.
7.  `getTotalMembers() view`: Returns the total count of active members.
8.  `proposeProject(string calldata title, string calldata description, uint256 fundingGoal)`: Allows a member (with sufficient reputation) to propose a new artistic project.
9.  `fundProject(uint256 projectId) payable`: Allows anyone to contribute funds to a project in the 'Funding' status.
10. `getProjectInfo(uint256 projectId) view`: Retrieves details about a project.
11. `getProjectStatus(uint256 projectId) view`: Gets the current status of a project.
12. `getProjectFundingStatus(uint256 projectId) view`: Returns current vs. goal funding for a project.
13. `assignProjectContributor(uint256 projectId, address contributor)`: Creator or governance can assign a member as a contributor to a project (internal tracking for potential shares).
14. `getProjectContributors(uint256 projectId) view`: Lists members assigned as contributors to a project.
15. `claimProjectShare(uint256 projectId)`: Allows an assigned contributor or funder to claim their share of distributed project funds/assets after completion via governance.
16. `getClaimableProjectShares(uint256 projectId, address memberAddress) view`: Checks how much a member can claim from a completed project.
17. `proposeGovernanceAction(ProposalType proposalType, string calldata description, address targetContract, bytes calldata callData, uint256 value, uint256 projectId, address memberAddress, int256 reputationChange, bytes32 parameterKey, uint256 parameterValue)`: Allows a member (with sufficient reputation) to create a governance proposal covering various actions.
18. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool vote)`: Allows a member (or their delegate) to cast a vote on an active proposal.
19. `delegateVotingPower(address delegatee)`: Allows a member to delegate their voting power to another member.
20. `revokeVotingDelegation()`: Allows a member to revoke their voting delegation.
21. `getVotingPower(address memberAddress) view`: Calculates the effective voting power of a member (based on reputation, delegation).
22. `getProposalInfo(uint256 proposalId) view`: Retrieves details about a governance proposal.
23. `getProposalVotingStatus(uint256 proposalId) view`: Gets current vote counts (yes/no) and state.
24. `checkProposalState(uint256 proposalId) view`: Determines the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed).
25. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows anyone to execute a successful proposal after the voting period ends.
26. `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows the proposer or governance to cancel a proposal before it ends/executes.
27. `depositToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to donate funds to the general guild treasury.
28. `withdrawFromTreasury(uint256 amount)`: Internal function, only executable via governance proposal.
29. `distributeTreasuryProfits(uint256 amount, address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata shares)`: Internal function, only executable via governance proposal, distributes treasury funds.
30. `grantReputation(address memberAddress, uint256 amount)`: Internal function, only executable via governance proposal, increases member reputation.
31. `burnReputation(address memberAddress, uint256 amount)`: Internal function, only executable via governance proposal, decreases member reputation.
32. `setGuildParameter(bytes32 key, uint256 value)`: Internal function, only executable via governance proposal, changes a guild parameter.
33. `getGuildParameter(bytes32 key) view`: Retrieves the value of a dynamic guild parameter.
34. `getMinimumProposalReputation() view`: Gets the required reputation to propose.
35. `getVotingPeriodLength() view`: Gets the length of the voting period.
36. `getQuorumRequirement() view`: Gets the minimum percentage of total voting power needed for a proposal to pass.
37. `getApprovalThreshold() view`: Gets the minimum percentage of 'yes' votes among cast votes needed for a proposal to pass.
38. `getActiveProposals() view`: Returns a list of IDs for proposals currently in the 'Active' state (iterative view, potential gas consideration).
39. `getProjectsByStatus(ProjectStatus status) view`: Returns a list of IDs for projects matching a given status (iterative view, potential gas consideration).
