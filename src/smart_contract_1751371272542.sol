Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines several interesting, non-standard concepts:
1.  **Conditional Access based on Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Funds or actions require verifying a ZK proof off-chain and submitting it on-chain.
2.  **Verifiable Attestations:** A system where trusted "Attestors" can issue signed claims about entities, and these claims can be verified on-chain as part of access conditions.
3.  **Dynamic Unlock Conditions:** The specific ZK proof type and required attestations for accessing assets can be set dynamically via a controlled mechanism.
4.  **NFT-Specific Rules:** Individual NFTs held in the vault can have unique unlock conditions.
5.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Beyond just `owner`, introduce `guardians` who have specific powers (e.g., emergency actions, configuration).

Let's call it `QuantumFluxVault`.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** QuantumFluxVault

**Core Concept:** A vault that stores ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens. Access to withdraw these assets is gated by a combination of verifying a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK proof) and possessing valid Verifiable Attestations issued by designated entities. The specific ZK proof type and required attestations are dynamically configurable.

**Key Concepts Utilized:**
*   Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification (via an external verifier contract).
*   On-chain Verifiable Attestations (a custom simple system).
*   Dynamic Configuration of Access Rules.
*   Role-Based Access Control (Owner, Guardians, Attestors).
*   Handling Multiple Asset Types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721).
*   ERC721 Receiving Hook (`onERC721Received`).

**Outline:**
1.  **State Variables:** Store owner, guardians, attestors, asset balances, ZK verifier address, attestation registry, unlock condition configurations, active condition group, NFT-specific rules.
2.  **Events:** Announce significant actions (deposits, withdrawals, rule changes, role changes, attestations).
3.  **Modifiers:** Access control (`onlyOwner`, `onlyGuardian`, `onlyAttestor`).
4.  **Structures:** Define `Attestation` and `UnlockConditionGroup`.
5.  **Interfaces:** Define `IZKVerifier` and standard ERC interfaces (`IERC20`, `IERC721`).
6.  **Constructor:** Initialize owner and initial guardians/attestors.
7.  **Core Vault Functions:** Deposit/withdraw ETH, ERC20, ERC721.
8.  **Access Control & Roles:** Manage Owner, Guardians, Attestors.
9.  **ZK Verification Integration:** Set verifier, define required proof types.
10. **Attestation System:** Attest conditions, revoke attestations, check attestation validity.
11. **Dynamic Rules Configuration:** Define condition groups (ZK + Attestations), activate groups.
12. **Conditional Unlock:** The main function to attempt unlocking assets via ZK proof and attestation verification.
13. **NFT-Specific Rules:** Set and get unlock requirements for individual NFTs.
14. **Emergency/Fallback:** Emergency withdrawal functions (potentially time-locked or guardian-controlled).
15. **Helper/View Functions:** Get balances, role status, rule details, attestation details.
16. **ERC721 Receiver Hook:** Implement `onERC721Received` to accept NFTs.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

**Core Vault Operations:**
1.  `depositETH()`: Receive Ether into the vault.
2.  `depositERC20(tokenAddress, amount)`: Deposit ERC20 tokens.
3.  `onERC721Received(...)`: Standard hook to receive ERC721 tokens. Handles deposit logic.
4.  `withdrawETH(amount)`: Withdraw Ether - *Gated by unlock conditions*.
5.  `withdrawERC20(tokenAddress, amount)`: Withdraw ERC20 tokens - *Gated by unlock conditions*.
6.  `withdrawERC721(tokenAddress, tokenId)`: Withdraw ERC721 token - *Gated by unlock conditions (potentially NFT-specific)*.

**Access Control & Roles:**
7.  `addGuardian(guardian)`: Add an address to the list of guardians (Owner only).
8.  `removeGuardian(guardian)`: Remove an address from the list of guardians (Owner only).
9.  `isGuardian(account)`: Check if an address is a guardian (View).
10. `addAttestor(attestor)`: Add an address to the list of approved attestors (Owner/Guardian).
11. `removeAttestor(attestor)`: Remove an address from the list of approved attestors (Owner/Guardian).
12. `isAttestor(account)`: Check if an address is an attestor (View).
13. `transferOwnership(newOwner)`: Transfer contract ownership (Owner only).
14. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounce contract ownership (Owner only - use with caution).

**ZK Verification & Configuration:**
15. `setZKVerifier(verifierAddress)`: Set the address of the external ZK verifier contract (Owner only).
16. `getZKVerifier()`: Get the current ZK verifier address (View).

**Attestation System:**
17. `attestCondition(conditionHash, targetAddress, validityTimestamp)`: An Attestor issues an attestation for a target address regarding a specific condition (Attestor only).
18. `revokeAttestation(conditionHash, targetAddress)`: An Attestor revokes their previously issued attestation (Attestor only).
19. `getAttestation(attestor, conditionHash, targetAddress)`: Retrieve details of a specific attestation (View).
20. `isValidAttestation(attestor, conditionHash, targetAddress)`: Check if a specific attestation exists and is valid (View).

**Dynamic Rule Configuration:**
21. `defineUnlockConditionGroup(groupId, requiredZKProofHash, requiredAttestationTypes)`: Define a reusable set of unlock requirements (Owner/Guardian).
22. `activateUnlockConditionGroup(groupId)`: Make a defined group the currently active requirement for withdrawals (Owner/Guardian).
23. `getUnlockConditionGroup(groupId)`: Retrieve details of a defined condition group (View).
24. `getActiveConditionGroupId()`: Get the ID of the currently active condition group (View).

**Conditional Unlock & Verification (The core complex function):**
25. `verifyAndAttemptUnlock(proof, publicInputs)`: User submits ZK proof and public inputs. Contract verifies the proof using the external verifier and checks if the *active* condition group requirements (ZK proof type + required attestations for `msg.sender`) are met. If successful, this *enables subsequent withdrawals* for a limited time or for a specific allocation (implementation choice - let's make it enable subsequent standard withdrawals for `msg.sender`). *This function itself does not transfer assets.*

**NFT-Specific Rules:**
26. `setNFTUnlockConditionGroup(tokenAddress, tokenId, groupId)`: Set a specific unlock condition group that applies *only* to this individual NFT, overriding the active general condition group (Owner/Guardian).
27. `getNFTUnlockConditionGroup(tokenAddress, tokenId)`: Get the specific condition group ID for an NFT (View).

**Emergency Operations:**
28. `emergencyWithdrawETH(amount, recipient)`: Guardian-controlled emergency ETH withdrawal (circumvents normal unlock conditions, potentially with a delay or multi-sig requirement - keeping it simple guardian-only for count).
29. `emergencyWithdrawERC20(tokenAddress, amount, recipient)`: Guardian-controlled emergency ERC20 withdrawal.
30. `emergencyWithdrawERC721(tokenAddress, tokenId, recipient)`: Guardian-controlled emergency ERC721 withdrawal.

**Helper/View Functions:**
31. `getVaultETHBalance()`: Get the total ETH balance of the contract (View).
32. `getVaultERC20Balance(tokenAddress)`: Get the balance of a specific ERC20 token (View).
33. `isNFTInVault(tokenAddress, tokenId)`: Check if a specific NFT is held by the vault (View).
34. `getRequiredAttestationTypes(groupId)`: Get the list of attestation types required in a condition group (View).
35. `isWithdrawalEnabled(account)`: Check if withdrawals are currently enabled for an account after successful verification (View). (Requires state variable/mapping to track this).

*(Note: This list already exceeds 20 functions, providing a rich set of interactions based on the concepts.)*

This contract provides a framework where:
*   Anyone can deposit assets.
*   Withdrawals are blocked by default.
*   Guardians and Attestors are key roles.
*   Guardians define complex unlock conditions involving ZK proofs and attestations via `defineUnlockConditionGroup` and activate them via `activateUnlockConditionGroup`. They also set the `zkVerifier`.
*   Attestors issue attestations about users/conditions.
*   A user calls `verifyAndAttemptUnlock` (or `verifyAndAttemptNFTUnlock` for specific NFTs) with a valid ZK proof and its public inputs.
*   The contract verifies the proof and checks if the user has valid attestations matching the *currently active* or *NFT-specific* condition group requirements.
*   If all checks pass, the user's address is flagged in the `withdrawalEnabled` mapping, allowing them to call the standard `withdrawETH`, `withdrawERC20`, or `withdrawERC721` functions. The withdrawal function then resets the flag.
*   Guardians have emergency functions to retrieve assets bypassing conditions.

This design is significantly more complex and uses more advanced concepts than a typical vault or token contract. It is *not* a direct copy of a standard open-source pattern. Remember that deploying such a contract requires careful consideration of the specific ZK system used (impacting `IZKVerifier` and `publicInputs`), extensive testing, and professional security audits.
