/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (Inspired by user request)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery with advanced features like curated exhibitions,
 *      artist royalties, governance voting on art acquisition and gallery parameters, NFT fractionalization,
 *      dynamic pricing, and community-driven grants.

 * **Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **1. NFT Management & Core Gallery Functions:**
 *    - `mintArtNFT(address _artist, string memory _tokenURI)`: Allows verified artists to mint their artwork as NFTs.
 *    - `listNFTForSale(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: Artists can list their NFTs for sale in the gallery.
 *    - `purchaseNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Buyers can purchase NFTs listed in the gallery.
 *    - `transferNFT(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`: NFT owners can transfer their NFTs.
 *    - `setRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _percentage)`: Gallery owner sets the royalty percentage for artists on secondary sales.
 *    - `withdrawArtistEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their accumulated earnings from NFT sales and royalties.

 * **2. Exhibition & Curation Features:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Curators can create themed exhibitions with time limits.
 *    - `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Curators can add approved NFTs to active exhibitions.
 *    - `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Curators can remove art from an exhibition.
 *    - `voteForExhibitionArt(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Community members can vote on which art pieces should be featured in upcoming exhibitions.
 *    - `setCurator(address _curator, bool _isActive)`: Gallery owner can appoint or revoke curator status.

 * **3. Governance & DAO Features:**
 *    - `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _proposalDescription, bytes memory _functionCallData)`: Governance token holders can create proposals for gallery changes.
 *    - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Governance token holders can vote on active proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: If a proposal passes, it can be executed to change gallery parameters.
 *    - `setGovernanceTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress)`: Gallery owner sets the address of the governance token contract.

 * **4. Advanced & Creative Features:**
 *    - `fractionalizeNFT(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: NFT owners can fractionalize their NFTs into ERC20 tokens for shared ownership.
 *    - `buyFractionalizedNFTFractions(uint256 _fractionalizedTokenId, uint256 _amount)`: Users can buy fractions of fractionalized NFTs.
 *    - `redeemNFTFromFractions(uint256 _fractionalizedTokenId)`: If a user holds a majority of fractions, they can redeem the original NFT.
 *    - `donateToArtist(address _artist)`: Users can directly donate ETH to support their favorite artists registered in the gallery.
 *    - `requestArtistGrant(string memory _grantReason)`: Registered artists can request grants from the gallery's treasury, subject to community voting.
 *    - `voteOnArtistGrant(uint256 _grantRequestId, bool _vote)`: Governance token holders can vote on artist grant requests.
 *    - `fundGalleryTreasury()`: Allows anyone to contribute ETH to the gallery treasury for operations and grants.

 * **5. Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *    - `getNFTDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns details about a specific NFT in the gallery.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns details about a specific exhibition.
 *    - `getArtistProfile(address _artist)`: Returns profile information of a registered artist.
 *    - `registerArtist(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio)`: Artists can register their profiles with the gallery.
 *    - `verifyArtist(address _artist, bool _isVerified)`: Gallery owner can verify artists to allow NFT minting.
 *    - `pauseGallery(bool _pause)`: Gallery owner can pause core functionalities for maintenance or emergencies.
