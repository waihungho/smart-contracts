/**
 * @title Decentralized Social Impact Bonds (DSIB) Contract
 * @author Your Name
 * @dev This contract implements a novel approach to Social Impact Bonds (SIBs)
 *      using blockchain technology.  It focuses on dynamically adjusting outcome
 *      payments based on the verifiable impact, incorporating DAO-governed
 *      impact assessment, and utilizing fractional NFTs to represent and
 *      trade impact shares.  This avoids typical SIB issues like difficult
 *      measurement and lack of transparency.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **State Variables:**  Defines key parameters of the SIB, including
 *    impact metrics, outcome targets, interest rates, and stakeholders.
 * 2. **Structs:** Defines data structures for impact assessments, NFT metadata,
 *    and stakeholder information.
 * 3. **Events:** Emits events to log important contract state changes.
 * 4. **Modifiers:** Implements access control and validation checks.
 * 5. **Constructor:** Initializes the contract with the required parameters.
 * 6. **ImpactAssessment Module:**
 *    - `submitImpactAssessment(uint256 assessmentId, uint256[] memory metricValues, string memory supportingEvidence)`: Allows assessors to submit impact data.
 *    - `validateImpactAssessment(uint256 assessmentId)`: Allows DAO to validate/invalidate submitted impact assessment
 *    - `getImpactAssessment(uint256 assessmentId)`: Retrieve submitted impact assessment by id
 * 7. **Stakeholder Management Module:**
 *    - `addStakeholder(address stakeholderAddress, StakeholderRole role)`: Adds a stakeholder with a specific role.
 *    - `removeStakeholder(address stakeholderAddress)`: Removes a stakeholder.
 *    - `updateStakeholderRole(address stakeholderAddress, StakeholderRole newRole)`: Updates a stakeholder's role.
 * 8. **Outcome Payment Calculation Module:**
 *    - `calculateOutcomePayment()`: Calculates the outcome payment based on the validated impact assessment.
 *    - `distributeOutcomePayment()`: Distributes the calculated outcome payment to investors.
 * 9. **Fractional NFT (F-NFT) Module:**
 *    - `mintImpactShares(uint256 amount)`: Mints F-NFTs representing impact shares for investors.
 *    - `transferImpactShares(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers F-NFTs between addresses.
 *    - `redeemImpactShares()`: Allows investors to redeem their F-NFTs for a pro-rata share of the outcome payment.
 * 10. **DAO Integration:**
 *     -  This contract incorporates DAO-based governance for validating impact
 *        assessments.  A simplified governance mechanism is implemented using
 *        a whitelist of addresses authorized to validate.  In a production
 *        environment, this would be replaced with a more robust DAO framework
 *        like Compound Governance or Aragon.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - **constructor()**:  Initializes the DSIB contract.
 * - **submitImpactAssessment()**:  Allows approved assessors to submit impact data.
 * - **validateImpactAssessment()**:  Allows DAO members to validate or invalidate impact assessments.
 * - **calculateOutcomePayment()**:  Calculates the total outcome payment based on the validated impact assessment and defined performance metrics.
 * - **distributeOutcomePayment()**:  Distributes the outcome payment to investors proportionally based on their F-NFT holdings.
 * - **mintImpactShares()**:  Mints F-NFTs representing impact shares.
 * - **transferImpactShares()**:  Transfers F-NFTs.
 * - **redeemImpactShares()**:  Redeems F-NFTs for a share of the outcome payment.
 * - **addStakeholder()**: Adds a new stakeholder.
 * - **removeStakeholder()**: Removes an existing stakeholder.
 * - **updateStakeholderRole()**: Updates the role of a stakeholder.

Key improvements and explanations of the advanced concepts used:

* **Decentralized Social Impact Bonds (DSIB):** The core concept is a blockchain-based implementation of SIBs, addressing their traditional limitations around transparency and measurement.
* **Fractional NFTs (F-NFTs) for Impact Shares:** Investors receive F-NFTs representing their share in the *impact* achieved, not just the financial investment.  This creates a tradable representation of social good and aligns investor incentives with impact.
* **DAO-Governed Impact Assessment:** Instead of relying solely on a central authority, the contract integrates a DAO for validating impact assessments.  This makes the process more transparent and accountable.  The `isDAOValidator` mapping represents a simplified DAO membership.  In a real-world scenario, this would integrate with an existing DAO framework.
* **Dynamic Outcome Payment Calculation:**  The `calculateOutcomePayment` function allows for a *flexible* calculation of the outcome payment based on multiple impact metrics and their respective weights. This can accommodate complex social interventions with varying degrees of success across different areas. The function's implementation should be updated based on the real use case, since that is a basic version.
* **Stakeholder Management with Roles:** The `StakeholderRole` enum and associated functions provide a structured way to manage different participants in the SIB, each with specific permissions.
* **Event Emission:**  Extensive use of events allows for off-chain monitoring and auditing of the contract's activity.
* **Modifiers for Access Control:** Modifiers ensure that only authorized actors can perform sensitive operations.
* **Error Handling:**  `require` statements are used throughout the contract to enforce preconditions and prevent errors.  Clear error messages are provided to aid debugging.
* **Upgradeable Smart Contract Considerations:** While the code is not explicitly upgradeable, the modular structure (Impact Assessment Module, Stakeholder Management Module, etc.) lends itself well to future upgrades using proxy patterns. You would need to separate the logic from the storage.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The `distributeOutcomePayment` and `redeemImpactShares` functions could be vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks.  Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern or a re-entrancy guard (from OpenZeppelin) to mitigate this risk.  I tried to mitigate this in `redeemImpactShares` by setting the balance to 0 *before* the transfer.
    * **Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow:**  Using Solidity 0.8.0 or later mitigates arithmetic overflow/underflow issues as it includes checked arithmetic by default.
    * **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The `distributeOutcomePayment` function could potentially face DoS issues if there are a very large number of investors. Consider batching or using a "pull" payment model where investors claim their rewards.
* **Gas Optimization:** There are several areas where gas optimization could be applied. For example, using more efficient data structures or reducing the number of storage writes.
* **Testing:**  Thorough testing is essential to ensure the contract's functionality and security.  Write unit tests to cover all functions and edge cases.
* **DAO Integration (Extensibility):** The current DAO integration is very basic. A more robust implementation would integrate with a proper DAO framework like Compound Governance or Aragon, allowing for proposals, voting, and more complex governance mechanisms.

This contract showcases several advanced concepts and provides a solid foundation for building a real-world DSIB platform.  Remember to thoroughly review, test, and audit the code before deploying it to a production environment.
