This smart contract, `AetheriaGenesis`, orchestrates a decentralized ecosystem around "Aetherial Artifacts" â€“ dynamic NFTs that evolve based on community interaction and external AI-driven sentiment analysis (simulated via an oracle). It features a robust, reputation-based DAO governance system and gamified "Discovery Challenges" to foster community engagement and content generation.

The core idea is to create a living, evolving collection of digital assets where their characteristics are not static but are influenced by a blend of collective human insight and computational intelligence.

## Contract: `AetheriaGenesis`

### Outline:

1.  **Core Artifact Management (Aetherial Artifacts - Dynamic ERC721 NFTs)**
    *   Defines the structure and properties of Aetherial Artifacts.
    *   Functions for minting, requesting evolution (via oracle), fulfilling evolution, and tracking interactions.
    *   Inherits `ERC721` for standard NFT functionality, overriding `tokenURI` for dynamic metadata.
2.  **Insight Points (Reputation System)**
    *   A non-transferable point system representing a user's reputation and influence within the ecosystem.
    *   Supports delegation of voting power, akin to a simplified liquid democracy.
3.  **DAO Governance**
    *   Enables the community (weighted by Insight Points) to propose, vote on, and execute changes to the protocol or new initiatives.
    *   Proposals can include awarding Insight Points, setting oracle addresses, or pausing the contract.
4.  **Discovery Challenges & Curation**
    *   A gamified mechanism for users to propose new Aetherial Artifact concepts or curate existing ones.
    *   Features submission periods, voting, and rewards for winning entries, fostering creative contribution.
5.  **Oracle Interface (Simulated)**
    *   A dedicated interface for a (simulated) external AI oracle service to push sentiment analysis results back to the contract, triggering artifact evolution.
    *   Includes a development function to manually simulate oracle calls for testing purposes.
6.  **Access Control & Utility**
    *   `Ownable` (initially, with DAO expected to take over ownership for key functions).
    *   `Pausable` for emergency control.
    *   Functions for setting base URI and withdrawing funds.

2.  `requestArtifactEvolution(uint256 _artifactId)`: Initiates a request to the external AI oracle for the specified artifact's evolution. Logs an event for off-chain listeners.
3.  `fulfillArtifactEvolution(uint256 _artifactId, uint256 _newSentimentScore, string memory _newMetadataURI)`: Oracle-only callback function to update an artifact's sentiment score, metadata URI, and evolution stage.
4.  `getArtifactDetails(uint256 _artifactId)`: Returns a structured view of all current details for a given Aetherial Artifact.
5.  `signalArtifactInteraction(uint256 _artifactId)`: Allows a user to register an interaction with an artifact, incrementing its total interaction count.
6.  `tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId)`: Overrides the standard ERC721 `tokenURI` to dynamically fetch the latest metadata URI from the artifact's state.

**II. Insight Points (Reputation System)**

7.  `awardInsightPoints(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Grants a specified amount of Insight Points to an address. Only callable by the DAO/owner.

9.  `getInsightPoints(address _user)`: Returns the direct Insight Points held by a user (excluding delegated points).
10. `delegateInsightPoints(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to delegate a portion of their Insight Points to another address for governance purposes.
11. `undelegateInsightPoints(uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to recall previously delegated Insight Points.
12. `getEffectiveInsightPoints(address _user)`: Returns the total effective Insight Points for a user, comprising their own points plus any points delegated to them. This is used for voting power.

**III. DAO Governance**

13. `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata, address _target, uint256 _value, uint256 _duration)`: Creates a new governance proposal that can include execution logic for the contract. Requires sufficient Insight Points.

15. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has passed its voting period and met the necessary approval thresholds.
16. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves all pertinent information about a specific governance proposal.

**IV. Discovery Challenges & Curation**

17. `createDiscoveryChallenge(string memory _topic, uint256 _submissionPeriod, uint256 _votingPeriod, uint256 _rewardAmount, address _rewardToken)`: Initiates a new community challenge with specified periods and a reward. Callable by the DAO/owner.
18. `submitChallengeEntry(uint256 _challengeId, string memory _entryURI)`: Allows users to submit an entry (e.g., a new artifact concept's metadata URI) to an active challenge.
19. `voteOnChallengeEntry(uint256 _challengeId, uint256 _entryId)`: Enables users to vote on a submitted challenge entry using their effective Insight Points.
20. `determineChallengeWinner(uint256 _challengeId)`: Callable by the DAO/owner to finalize a challenge, identify the winning entry based on votes, and record the winner.
21. `claimChallengeReward(uint256 _challengeId)`: Allows the determined winner of a challenge to claim their reward token.

**V. Oracle Interface (Managed & Simulated)**

22. `setOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Sets the address of the trusted AI oracle contract. Only callable by the DAO/owner.
23. `simulateOracleCall(uint256 _artifactId, uint256 _simulatedSentiment, string memory _simulatedURI)`: (Development/testing function) Allows the owner to directly simulate an oracle callback, updating an artifact's state without an actual external oracle request.

**VI. Access Control & Utility**

24. `setBaseURI(string memory _newBaseURI)`: Sets a new base URI for the Aetherial Artifacts, affecting how `tokenURI` resolves metadata. Only callable by the DAO/owner.
25. `pause()`: Pauses certain contract functionalities (e.g., minting, proposal creation) in case of emergencies. Callable by the DAO/owner.
26. `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract, restoring full functionality. Callable by the DAO/owner.
27. `withdrawFunds(address _tokenAddress, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the DAO/owner to withdraw ERC20 tokens or native currency (if `_tokenAddress` is `address(0)`) accidentally sent to the contract.
