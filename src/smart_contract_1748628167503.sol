Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that incorporates elements of time-locked value, dynamic state, staking, and governance, without directly copying common protocols. We'll call it `ChronoBank`.

The core idea: Users deposit approved ERC-20 tokens and receive special `ChronoToken` (CT) which represents a claim on their future principal *plus* yield. The principal and yield vest over time, specifically across predefined "Epochs". Staking ChronoTokens *accelerates* their vesting rate and also earns yield distributed at the end of each epoch. Early withdrawal or unstaking incurs a penalty. The protocol parameters (epoch duration, yield rate formula, penalty rate, approved tokens) are controlled by staked CT holders through a basic governance mechanism.

This involves:
1.  **Time-based mechanics:** Epochs, vesting schedules tied to epochs.
2.  **Dynamic state:** Contract state changes at epoch transitions, affecting vesting and yield calculation.
3.  **Staking:** Locking CTs for benefits (accelerated vesting, yield, governance).
4.  **Penalties:** Deterring premature exit.
5.  **Governance:** Decentralized control over key parameters.
6.  **ERC-20 Interaction:** Accepting deposits and potentially distributing rewards in other tokens.

Let's structure the code with outline and function summaries.

/**
 * @title ChronoBank Protocol
 * @author YourName (or pseudonymous)
 * @notice A time-locked value protocol where users deposit ERC-20 tokens
 *         to receive ChronoTokens (CT). CTs represent future claims on principal
 *         plus yield, vesting over Epochs. Staking CTs accelerates vesting
 *         and earns yield. Early unstaking/claiming incurs penalties.
 *         Key parameters are controlled by staked CT holders via governance.
 *
 * ChronoBank Outline:
 * 1. State Variables: Core contract state, balances, vesting data, epoch info, governance data.
 * 2. Events: Significant actions logged for transparency.
 * 3. Modifiers: Access control and state checks.
 * 4. Constructor: Initialize the contract with base parameters.
 * 5. Core User Functions: Deposit, Stake, Unstake, Claim Principal & Yield.
 * 6. Epoch Management: Triggering epoch transitions, yield calculation/distribution.
 * 7. Vesting & Claim Calculation: Helper functions to determine vested amounts and claimable values.
 * 8. Penalty System: Calculating and managing early exit penalties.
 * 9. Governance System: Proposal creation, voting, execution, parameter setting.
 * 10. Admin/Emergency Functions: Owner-controlled functions (potentially transferable to governance).
 * 11. View Functions: Public functions to read contract state and user data.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - constructor(address initialOwner, uint256 _epochDuration, uint256 _vestingEpochs, uint256 _baseYieldRatePerEpoch, uint256 _earlyUnstakePenaltyBasisPoints, uint256 _minStakeForProposal): Initializes the protocol parameters and sets the owner.
 * - setEpochDuration(uint256 _epochDuration): Governance function to set the duration of each epoch.
 * - addApprovedToken(address tokenAddress): Governance function to add an ERC-20 token to the list of approved deposit tokens.
 * - removeApprovedToken(address tokenAddress): Governance function to remove an approved deposit token.
 * - deposit(address token, uint256 amount): Allows a user to deposit an approved ERC-20 token and receive ChronoTokens.
 * - stake(uint256 amount): Allows a user to stake their ChronoTokens to accelerate vesting and earn yield.
 * - unstake(uint256 amount): Allows a user to unstake their ChronoTokens, potentially incurring a penalty if not fully vested.
 * - claimDepositAndYield(): Allows a user to claim their vested principal deposit amount and accrued yield.
 * - triggerEpochTransition(): Anyone can call this function to advance the epoch if the required time has passed, triggering yield calculation and distribution for the previous epoch.
 * - calculateYieldForEpoch(uint256 epochId): Internal/Helper function to calculate the yield to be distributed for a specific epoch based on staked CTs.
 * - distributeEpochYield(uint256 epochId): Internal function to distribute the calculated yield for an epoch to eligible stakers.
 * - calculateVestedChronoAmount(address user): Helper view function to calculate the currently vested amount of a user's ChronoTokens based on time passed and staking status.
 * - calculateEarlyUnstakePenalty(address user, uint256 unstakeAmount): Helper view function to calculate the penalty for unstaking a given amount before full vesting.
 * - proposeParameterChange(bytes calldata proposalData): Allows a user with sufficient staked CTs to propose a parameter change (encoded in proposalData).
 * - voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support): Allows a staked CT holder to vote on an active proposal.
 * - executeProposal(uint256 proposalId): Allows anyone to execute an approved proposal after the voting period ends.
 * - getApprovedTokens(): View function to get the list of approved deposit tokens.
 * - getCurrentEpoch(): View function to get the current epoch number.
 * - getEpochStartTime(uint256 epochId): View function to get the start timestamp of a specific epoch.
 * - getEpochDuration(): View function to get the current epoch duration.
 * - getVestingEpochs(): View function to get the total number of epochs required for full vesting.
 * - getEarlyUnstakePenaltyRate(): View function to get the current early unstake penalty rate in basis points.
 * - getMinStakeForProposal(): View function to get the minimum staked CT required to create a governance proposal.
 * - getUserChronoBalance(address user): View function to get a user's total ChronoToken balance (staked + unstaked).
 * - getUserStakedBalance(address user): View function to get a user's staked ChronoToken balance.
 * - getUserVestedChronoAmount(address user): View function to get the user's calculated vested ChronoToken amount.

 * - getUserClaimableYield(address user): View function to get the user's total accumulated claimable yield.
 * - getProposalState(uint256 proposalId): View function to get the current state of a governance proposal.
 * - getProposalVoteCounts(uint256 proposalId): View function to get the vote counts for a governance proposal.
 * - getPenaltyPoolBalance(): View function to get the total balance of tokens accumulated from early unstake penalties.
 * - emergencyShutdown(): Allows the owner (or potentially governance) to halt protocol operations in an emergency.
 * - rescueFunds(address token, uint256 amount): Allows owner (or governance) to withdraw accidentally sent tokens (excluding approved deposit tokens and CT).
 *
 * ChronoToken (Internal ERC-20 implementation simplified):
 * - mint(address to, uint256 amount): Internal function to create new ChronoTokens.
 * - burn(address from, uint256 amount): Internal function to destroy ChronoTokens.
 * - transfer(address to, uint256 amount): Standard ERC-20 transfer (can be restricted for staked tokens).
 * - transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount): Standard ERC-20 transferFrom.
 * - approve(address spender, uint256 amount): Standard ERC-20 approve.
 * - allowance(address owner, address spender): Standard ERC-20 allowance.
 * - totalSupply(): Standard ERC-20 totalSupply.
 * - balanceOf(address account): Standard ERC-20 balanceOf.
 *
 * Note: This is a complex system. The actual implementation of yield calculation,
 * vesting acceleration based on staking, and parameter encoding/decoding for
 * governance proposals would require significant detail and potentially external libraries
 * or robust encoding standards (like ABI encoding or a custom format).
 * The yield calculation `calculateYieldForEpoch` is a placeholder for a more sophisticated
 * formula (e.g., based on total value locked, time, external factors via oracle).
 * The governance proposal data (`proposalData`) is a placeholder for specifying
 * which function to call and with what parameters.
 * Staking acceleration logic in `calculateVestedChronoAmount` is also a simplified concept.
 * Tracking individual deposit vesting vs. total CT vesting adds significant complexity.
 * This implementation focuses on tracking total CT vesting, with staking accelerating the overall rate.

     /**
      * @notice Internal function to distribute the calculated yield for an epoch.
      * This adds the yield amount proportionally to each staker's claimable yield pool.
      * Needs to iterate through stakers and add to their `userClaimableYield`.
      * This iteration can be gas-expensive if many stakers. A better pattern is lazy distribution.
      * Let's use lazy distribution: When a user claims, calculate their share of *all* past undistributed yield.
      * This requires tracking total yield per epoch and total staked supply per epoch.
      * This adds significant complexity (snapshotting staked balances per epoch).
      *
      * Let's switch back to the simpler model: `distributeEpochYield` calculates total yield,
      * and adds it to a global yield pool. Users claim their share of this global pool
      * based on their *current* stake percentage at the time of claiming.
      * No, the summary said it's added to *userClaimableYield*. This requires iteration or lazy calculation.
      *
      * Let's try a lazy approach for claimable yield calculation:
      * `userClaimableYield` tracks *accumulated* yield.
      * `calculateYieldForEpoch` *adds* to a global pool of yield to be distributed.
      * When `claimDepositAndYield` is called, the user's share is calculated from the global pool
      * based on their stake *over time*. This requires state variables to track:
      * - Total yield added to pool (`totalYieldPool`)
      * - Total staking seconds or "stake-epochs" accumulated globally (`totalStakeTime`)
      * - User's accumulated staking seconds or "stake-epochs" (`userStakeTime`)
      * - A point-in-time reference for when user last claimed yield share calculation (`userLastYieldClaimPoint`)
      * This is getting too complex for a summary.
      *
      * Let's revert to the simplest model for `distributeEpochYield` for demonstration:
      * It increases a global pool value, and `getUserClaimableYield` calculates the user's share.
      * This share could be based on their *current* stake relative to total stake, which isn't ideal.
      * It *should* be based on their stake over the epoch.
      *
      * Okay, let's redefine the simpler approach for `distributeEpochYield`:
      * It calculates the total yield. Instead of distributing it *now*, it adds it to a global
      * `undistributedYieldPool`. `userClaimableYield` becomes calculated by `getUserClaimableYield` view function,
      * which iterates through epochs since last claim point and calculates share based on stake *at that time*.
      * This still requires epoch-based stake snapshots.
      *
      * **Let's simplify significantly for this example:** Yield is added to `userClaimableYield` proportionally to their stake *at the moment of transition*.
      * This means `distributeEpochYield` needs to iterate through all stakers. This *will* be expensive.
      * This is a known challenge in DeFi protocols and often solved with lazy claiming or complex reward managers.
      * Let's implement the expensive iteration for the sake of hitting function count and concept, acknowledging its limitation.
      * It needs a list of all stakers, which is another state variable. Mapping `stakedBalances` doesn't give this.
      * Let's assume, for this example, we have a way to iterate stakers (e.g., a list populated on stake/unstake - adding more complexity).
      * **Alternative simple approach:** Distribute yield to a global pool, and users claim based on *current* stake proportion. This is simpler but less fair to past stakers. Let's do *this* for simplicity. Yield is added to a global pool, user claims a share of the *entire* pool based on their *current* stake percentage.

      * **Revised Yield Distribution Logic:**
      * `calculateYieldForEpoch` returns total yield amount (in CT equivalent).
      * `distributeEpochYield` takes this amount and adds it to a `totalYieldPool`.
      * `getUserClaimableYield` calculates user's share: `(userStakedBalance / totalStakedSupply) * totalYieldPool`.
      * `claimDepositAndYield` claims this calculated share and reduces `totalYieldPool` and `totalStakedSupply` proportionally? No, that's not right.
      * The standard lazy approach: `totalYieldPool` increases. `userClaimableYield` is a calculated value. When claimed, the user's *share* is removed from `totalYieldPool` and their `totalStakedSupplyAtLastClaim` point is updated. This requires snapshots again.

      * **Final Simplest Yield Model for Example:**
      * `totalYieldPool` state variable.
      * `distributeEpochYield` adds `calculatedYield` to `totalYieldPool`.
      * `getUserClaimableYield` calculates: `userTotalStakeTimeAccumulated * (totalYieldPool / totalStakeTimeAccumulatedGlobally)` - still requires stake time tracking.
      *
      * **Let's just make yield a value added *per epoch* to user's balance if they were staked, based on stake amount at epoch transition.** This still requires iterating *or* lazy claiming. Let's make yield claimable *separately* and use a lazy calculation for it.

      * **Revised Yield Distribution & Claim:**
      * `totalYieldPool` state variable.
      * `cumulativeStakeWeight` state variable (sum of user_stake * epochs).
      * `userLastClaimedEpoch` mapping.
      * `userCumulativeStakeWeight` mapping.
      * `distributeEpochYield` adds yield to `totalYieldPool` and updates `cumulativeStakeWeight`.
      * `getUserClaimableYield` calculates user's share based on `userCumulativeStakeWeight` since `userLastClaimedEpoch` relative to `cumulativeStakeWeight` change.
      * `claimYield` function separate from `claimPrincipal`.

      * This is getting complex again. Let's stick to the outline and provide placeholders for complex parts.
      * `distributeEpochYield` will simply be a placeholder indicating where yield distribution *logic* would go.

      * Let's make `calculateYieldForEpoch` return the amount *per staked CT*.
      * Then `distributeEpochYield` iterates through known stakers and adds `stakeAmount * yieldPerCT` to their `userClaimableYield`. Still requires list of stakers.
      * **Let's make yield lazy-claimed:** `totalYieldPoolValue` state. `totalStakedChronoSupplyAtLastYieldDistribution` state. `distributeEpochYield` adds yield, updates total staked supply snapshot. `getUserClaimableYield` calculates share based on user's *average* stake since last claim point and the yield pool increase. This requires more state.

      * **Final Plan for Example Simplicity:** `distributeEpochYield` adds the total yield amount to a global pool (`totalYieldPool`). `getUserClaimableYield` calculates the user's share based on their *current* staked balance relative to the *current* total staked balance. This is simple but potentially unfair.

    - `_totalStakedSupply()` (Internal View Helper) - Let's make this public view `getTotalStakedSupply`.

Okay, let's add `getTotalStakedSupply` as a public view.

37. `getTotalStakedSupply` (Public View) - Yes. Need to update the internal state variable `_totalStakedSupplyState` in `stake` and `unstake`.

Adding the required state variable and updating `stake` and `unstake`. Also need to update `getUserClaimableYield` to use `_totalStakedSupplyState`.

```solidity
// Add state variable:
uint256 private _totalStakedSupplyState;

// Update stake function:
function stake(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    require(amount > 0, "ChronoBank: Stake amount must be positive");
    require(chronoTokenBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, "ChronoBank: Insufficient CT balance");

    stakedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    _totalStakedSupplyState += amount; // Update total staked supply state

    emit Staked(msg.sender, amount);
}

// Update unstake function:
function unstake(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    require(amount > 0, "ChronoBank: Unstake amount must be positive");
    require(stakedBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, "ChronoBank: Insufficient staked CT balance");

    uint256 totalCT = chronoTokenBalances[msg.sender];
    uint256 vestedCT = calculateVestedChronoAmount(msg.sender);
    uint256 unvestedCT = totalCT > vestedCT ? totalCT - vestedCT : 0;

    uint256 unvestedPortionOfUnstake = totalCT > 0 ? (amount * unvestedCT) / totalCT : 0; // Handle totalCT == 0 edge case
    uint256 penaltyAmount = (unvestedPortionOfUnstake * earlyUnstakePenaltyBasisPoints) / 10000;

    // Ensure amount to unstake is positive after penalty
    require(amount > penaltyAmount, "ChronoBank: Unstake amount must be greater than penalty");

    stakedBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    _totalStakedSupplyState -= amount; // Update total staked supply state

    uint256 amountToUnstake = amount - penaltyAmount;

    // Burn the penalty amount
    if (penaltyAmount > 0) {
         _burn(msg.sender, penaltyAmount); // _burn updates _totalSupply and chronoTokenBalances
         emit ChronoTokensBurned(msg.sender, penaltyAmount);
    }

    // The remaining amount is now 'unstaked' in chronoTokenBalances (no token transfer out here)

    emit Unstaked(msg.sender, amount, penaltyAmount);
}

// Update getUserClaimableYield to use the state variable:
function getUserClaimableYield(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
    if (_totalStakedSupplyState == 0 || totalYieldPool == 0) {
         return 0;
    }
    // User's share = (userStakedBalance / totalStakedSupply) * totalYieldPool
    return (stakedBalances[user] * totalYieldPool) / _totalStakedSupplyState;
}

// Add the public view function
function getTotalStakedSupply() external view returns (uint256) {
    return _totalStakedSupplyState;
}

```
Ok, the function count is well over 20, and the concept involves multiple advanced features (time/epoch-based mechanics, accelerated vesting tied to staking, internal token, governance placeholders, dynamic yield pooling/claiming). It avoids direct copies of standard protocols like Uniswap, Compound, Aave, standard ERC721 contracts, basic staking-for-rewards, or simple vesting contracts. The outline and function summaries are provided at the top.

Final check of includes:
`IERC20`, `SafeERC20` (for deposits/claims) - Yes
`Ownable` (for initial admin/emergency) - Yes
`ReentrancyGuard` (for deposit/claim) - Yes

The `onlyOwnerOrGovernance` modifier is a placeholder and would need a more robust implementation in a real system to verify calls originate from the governance execution logic. The yield calculation and distribution models are simplified placeholders for demonstration purposes, as full implementations require significant complexity (snapshotting, lazy distribution math). But the *interface* and *concept* of distributing epoch yield and allowing claiming are there.

This contract is complex and illustrative of concepts, rather than a ready-to-deploy production system. It would require extensive testing, gas optimization, and refinement of the mathematical models (especially yield, vesting acceleration, and penalty calculation) for a real-world application.
