Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept that aims for advanced concepts, creativity, and incorporates several trendy elements like prediction markets, dynamic NFTs (outcome-based), and decentralized oracle/resolution mechanisms, while striving to be distinct from common open-source implementations.

The concept is a "Prognostic Artefact Engine". Users propose future events, others curate them, users predict outcomes by staking tokens, events are resolved via oracle or a staked-based voting mechanism, and upon resolution, unique NFTs ("Artefacts") representing the *actual outcome* are minted for participants, while winners share the prediction pool.

Outline:
1.  Data Structures: Enums for event state, Structs for Event, Prediction, OutcomeArtefact.
2.  State Variables: Mappings to store events, predictions, artefacts, balances, approvals. Counters for IDs. Addresses for treasury, staking token, oracle. Parameters for durations, fees, stake amounts.
3.  Events: To signal state changes, proposals, predictions, resolutions, artefact mints.
4.  Modifiers: For access control and state checks.
5.  Core Logic - Event Lifecycle:
    -   Proposing Events (Stake required)
    -   Curating Events (Stake to support/veto)
    -   Approving Events (Governance/Oracle based on curation)
    -   Predicting Outcomes (Stake tokens on chosen outcome)
    -   Resolving Events (Oracle decision or Stake-weighted Voting)
    -   Claiming Winnings (Share prediction pool based on correct prediction stake)
    -   Minting Outcome Artefacts (Unique NFT based on the resolved event outcome)
6.  Auxiliary Functions:
    -   Viewing state and data.
    -   Governance functions (Setting parameters, treasury withdrawal).
    -   Basic ERC721 implementation for Outcome Artefacts (balanceOf, ownerOf, transferFrom etc.).
7.  Error Handling: Using require statements.

Function Summary:

State Management & Lifecycle:
1.  proposeEvent(string calldata title, string calldata description, string[] calldata outcomes, uint256 curationEndTime, uint256 predictionEndTime, uint256 resolutionEndTime): Submit a new event proposal. Requires PROPOSAL_STAKE.
2.  stakeForCuration(uint256 eventId, bool support): Stake CURATION_STAKE on an event to support (or implicitly oppose by not staking).
3.  withdrawCurationStake(uint256 eventId): Withdraw curation stake if event is still Proposed or Cancelled.
4.  approveEvent(uint256 eventId): Owner/Oracle approves a curated event, moving it to Approved state. (Requires minimum curation stake threshold met - implicitly handled by oracle/owner check).
5.  cancelEvent(uint256 eventId): Owner/Oracle cancels an event at any stage before Resolved. Refunds stakes.
6.  stakeForPrediction(uint256 eventId, uint256 predictedOutcomeIndex): Stake PREDICTION_STAKE on a specific outcome for an Approved event.
7.  resolveEventByOracle(uint256 eventId, uint256 winningOutcomeIndex): Oracle finalizes event resolution with a specific winning outcome.
8.  triggerVoteResolution(uint256 eventId): Allows anyone to trigger stake-weighted voting resolution after oracle resolution time expires.
9.  voteForOutcome(uint256 eventId, uint256 outcomeIndex): Cast a vote for an outcome in a vote-resolving event. Requires active prediction stake.
10. finalizeVoteResolution(uint256 eventId): Finalizes vote resolution based on weighted votes.
11. claimWinnings(uint256 eventId): Claim share of prediction pool for correct predictions after resolution.
12. mintOutcomeArtefact(uint256 eventId): Mint the unique ERC721 Artefact representing the resolved outcome of an event.

Viewing Functions:
13. getEvent(uint256 eventId): Get details of an event.
14. getPrediction(uint256 predictionId): Get details of a prediction.
15. getUserPredictions(address user): Get list of prediction IDs for a user.
16. getEventPredictions(uint256 eventId): Get list of prediction IDs for an event.
17. getEventState(uint256 eventId): Get the current state of an event.
18. getWinningOutcome(uint256 eventId): Get the winning outcome index for a resolved event.
19. getArtefact(uint256 artefactTokenId): Get details of an Artefact.
20. getUserArtefacts(address user): Get list of Artefact token IDs owned by a user.
21. getTotalSupplyArtefacts(): Get the total number of Artefacts minted.

Governance/Treasury:
22. setParameters(uint256 newProposalStake, uint256 newCurationStake, uint256 newPredictionStake, uint256 newCurationDuration, uint256 newPredictionDuration, uint256 newResolutionDuration, uint256 newPlatformFeeBps): Set various contract parameters. (Owner only)
23. setOracleAddress(address newOracleAddress): Set the address of the trusted oracle. (Owner only)
24. withdrawTreasuryFunds(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount): Withdraw funds from the contract's treasury. (Owner only)

Internal ERC721 Implementation (for Artefacts):
25. balanceOf(address owner): ERC721 standard function.
26. ownerOf(uint256 tokenId): ERC721 standard function.
27. approve(address to, uint256 tokenId): ERC721 standard function.

**Explanation of Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Prediction Market Core:** Users stake tokens on discrete outcomes of future events. This is a fundamental DeFi primitive.
2.  **Event Curation:** A pre-prediction phase where users stake to signal interest or vet event proposals. This adds a layer of decentralized curation before committing large prediction stakes. (Approval by Oracle/Owner based on meeting off-chain criteria derived from curation stakes).
3.  **Dual Resolution Mechanism:**
    *   **Oracle Resolution:** A trusted address can finalize the event quickly.
    *   **Stake-Weighted Vote Resolution:** If the oracle is inactive or exceeds a time limit, anyone can trigger a voting phase. Users who predicted stake-weight their votes for the outcome they believe is correct. This adds a fallback decentralization mechanism.
4.  **Outcome Artefacts (Dynamic/Utility NFTs):** Unique ERC721 tokens are minted *after* an event is resolved. Each Artefact represents the *specific outcome* that occurred for that event.
    *   **Creativity:** The NFT isn't just a generic event ticket; its properties (like the `representingOutcomeIndex`) are determined by the real-world result of the event. This links the digital artifact directly to the historical outcome.
    *   **Potential Utility (Off-chain/Future):** These Artefacts could potentially be used for:
        *   Proof of participation/correct prediction history.
        *   Collectibles based on significant events/outcomes.
        *   Access to future events or communities related to certain outcomes.
        *   Inputs to other protocols (e.g., lending against rare outcome NFTs).
5.  **Native Fee Collection:** A platform fee is taken from the *winnings pool* during the `claimWinnings` function, directed to a designated treasury address. This is a standard DeFi pattern for sustainability.
6.  **Modular Parameters:** Key values like stake amounts, durations, and fees are stored in state variables and can be updated by the owner, allowing for flexibility and tuning.
7.  **Minimal ERC721 Implementation:** Instead of inheriting a full library like OpenZeppelin (which would be a direct duplicate of common open source), the core ERC721 functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `transferFrom`, etc.) are implemented directly within the contract. This fulfills the spirit of not duplicating *implementations* from standard libraries while still providing ERC721 compatibility for the Artefacts. (Note: A full, robust ERC721 implementation including things like `tokenURI` and ERC165 support would make the contract significantly longer, but this covers the basic transfer/ownership functions).
8.  **Structured Data:** Uses structs and mappings to organize events, predictions, and artefacts efficiently.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

*   **Oracle Reliance:** While there's a voting fallback, the primary resolution relies on a trusted oracle. Decentralizing the oracle further is a common challenge in this space.
*   **Voting Mechanism Complexity:** The stake-weighted voting requires iterating through a user's predictions to find their stake, which could be gas-intensive for users with many predictions. Storing a separate mapping of `eventUserStakes[eventId][user]` could optimize this. The current voting counts only count the *first* vote per user per event, weighted by their total stake in that event.
*   **Gas Costs:** Complex state changes and potentially iterating over arrays (like in `claimWinnings` or `transferFrom`'s `userArtefacts` update) can consume significant gas.
*   **Real-World Data:** Getting accurate, tamper-proof real-world outcomes onto the blockchain reliably is the core oracle problem, which this contract design assumes is handled (either by the trusted oracle or the voting mechanism).
*   **Security:** As with any smart contract, thorough auditing is essential, especially for handling user funds and state transitions.

This contract provides a framework for a novel prediction market integrated with outcome-based digital collectibles, incorporating several advanced concepts and meeting the function count requirement without directly copying the implementation details of standard open-source libraries like OpenZeppelin (except for importing the interface definitions).
