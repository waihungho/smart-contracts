Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract focusing on an advanced concept related to dynamic value distribution, reputation/interaction tracking, timed access, and abstract social mechanics. It's designed to be distinct from typical token, NFT, or simple staking contracts by combining several ideas:

1.  **Flux Points:** An internal, non-transferable score representing participation or reputation within the system.
2.  **Essence Pools:** Timed-release pools of value (e.g., ETH) claimable based on Flux Points.
3.  **Attunement:** Staking mechanism to boost Flux generation potential.
4.  **Resonance Frequency:** A dynamic, configurable parameter influencing Flux generation and claim rates.
5.  **Quantum Locks:** Contract-imposed time locks on user actions based on system configuration or interaction.
6.  **Entanglement Links:** An abstract mechanism allowing users to "link" with each other to potentially affect Flux generation or interaction benefits (simplified as a status for this example).
7.  **Singularity Event:** A major, owner-triggered event that can alter contract state significantly.

This contract is conceptual and designed to showcase advanced ideas rather than being production-ready without significant testing and potentially external components (like a sophisticated oracle for frequency).

 */

/*
 * Function Summary:
 * - constructor(): Deploys the contract, sets owner and initial configurations.
 * - createEssencePool(uint256 _unlockTimestamp): Owner creates a pool of ETH claimable after _unlockTimestamp.
 * - depositAdminFunds(): Owner deposits ETH into an admin reserve.
 * - withdrawAdminFunds(uint256 _amount): Owner withdraws ETH from the admin reserve.
 * - attuneStake(): User stakes ETH to boost potential Flux generation.
 * - detuneUnstake(): User unstakes ETH, potentially subject to a lock period.
 * - pulseFluxGeneration(): User triggers a periodic function to generate Flux based on stake, time, and resonance frequency. Cooldown applies.
 * - claimEssence(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _fluxToBurn): User claims ETH from an unlocked pool by burning Flux points. Claim amount is proportional to Flux burned relative to total Flux claimed from the pool, and remaining pool balance.
 * - requestEntanglementLink(address _target): User sends a link request to another address.
 * - acceptEntanglementLink(address _sender): User accepts a pending link request, establishing an active link.
 * - dissolveEntanglementLink(address _target): User dissolves an active link with a target address.
 * - setLinkableStatus(bool _status): User opts in or out of being linkable by others.
 * - updateResonanceFrequency(uint256 _newFrequency): Owner updates the global resonance frequency (simulates external oracle).
 * - configureRatesAndLocks(uint256 _baseFluxRate, uint256 _attunementMultiplier, uint256 _pulseCooldown, uint256 _defaultUnstakeLock): Owner sets core system parameters.
 * - setActionLockDuration(string memory _actionType, uint256 _duration): Owner configures the duration for specific Quantum Locks.
 * - triggerSingularityEvent(): Owner triggers a major, predefined state change or emergency action. (Placeholder logic provided).

        // Alternative: claimed_amount is proportional to flux burned relative to the *total* flux available across *all* potential claimants? Too complex.

        // If total_relevant_flux is the sum of flux burned *for this pool* (pool.totalFluxUsedForClaims + _fluxToBurn), then it's:
        // claimed_amount = (_fluxToBurn * pool.amount) / effectiveTotalFlux. This is still complex.

        // Let's use a simpler dynamic distribution logic:
        // Amount claimed = (_fluxToBurn * pool.remainingAmount) / (pool.remainingAmount is not the right base)
        // Let's go with a model where Flux has an "essence value" which is dynamic.

        // How about: claimAmount = _fluxToBurn * (pool.remainingAmount / pool.amount_at_last_claim_or_start) ???
        // This requires tracking pool amount at each claim step.

        // Let's make it truly proportional to initial pool amount based on total flux used:
        // Amount user has *proportional claim right* for = (user's total flux used on pool so far + _fluxToBurn) * pool.amount / (hypothetical total flux for pool?)

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Flux Points (Non-Transferable):** Unlike standard tokens, Flux cannot be sent between users. It's a pure internal reputation/activity score, similar in *concept* to Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) but implemented as a simple counter within this contract, tied to user actions.
2.  **Dynamic Value Distribution (Essence Pools):** The `claimEssence` function implements a form of dynamic proportional distribution. A user's claim amount isn't fixed but depends on their Flux contribution *relative to the total Flux contributed by everyone claiming from that specific pool*. This creates a mini-game around pool claims where the value of burning Flux is not constant and depends on other users' actions. This requires tracking `totalFluxUsedForClaims` and `userFluxBurnedPerPool` per pool. The `getUserClaimableAmountFromPool` view gives an *estimation* but highlights the dependency on dynamic state.
3.  **Resonance Frequency (Dynamic Parameter):** A global parameter (`resonanceFrequency`) directly influences the Flux generation rate and is intended to be updated by an external factor (simulated by `onlyOwner`). This allows the core mechanics of the contract to adapt over time based on market conditions, network activity, or oracle data, making the system's behavior dynamic.
4.  **Attunement (Staking Influence):** Simple staking (`attuneStake`) isn't new, but here it directly modifies the rate at which the non-transferable Flux is generated, tying capital commitment to interaction potential.
5.  **Quantum Locks (Contract-Imposed Time Locks):** Instead of users setting locks on *their own* assets, the *contract* imposes time locks on *actions* (`isActionLockedForUser`, `_applyQuantumLock`). These locks are configured by the owner (`setActionLockDuration`) and applied programmatically when certain actions (like unstaking or claiming) are performed. This adds a layer of system-enforced cooldowns and state transitions. Using string identifiers for action types allows for flexible configuration.
6.  **Entanglement Links (Abstract Social Graph):** The linking mechanism (`requestEntanglementLink`, `acceptEntanglementLink`, `dissolveEntanglementLink`, `setLinkableStatus`) is an abstract representation of connections between users. While simplified in this demo (unidirectional status), in a more complex version, these links could influence Flux generation (e.g., linked users boost each other), enable group claims, or affect social features. It's a step towards incorporating social graph concepts on-chain without revealing explicit relationships if designed carefully.
7.  **Singularity Event (Major State Transition):** The `triggerSingularityEvent` is a placeholder for a powerful, owner-controlled function that can cause significant, predefined changes to the system state. This could represent epoch transitions, emergency shutdowns, or major parameter resets, adding a distinct "phase" element to the contract's lifecycle.
8.  **Conceptual Naming:** The terminology ("Flux", "Essence", "Attunement", "Resonance", "Quantum", "Entanglement", "Singularity") is chosen to create a unique theme and abstract the mechanics, making it less of a direct copy of standard DeFi components.

**Limitations and Production Considerations:**

*   **Gas Efficiency:** Some view functions (like listing links) are conceptual due to limitations in iterating mappings efficiently on-chain. A production system would need alternative data structures or off-chain indexing. The proportional claim logic, while simplified, still involves multiplication and division which cost gas.
*   **Oracle Dependency:** The `updateResonanceFrequency` is owner-controlled for simplicity. A real application relying on external data would need a secure oracle integration (like Chainlink).
*   **Precision:** Handling proportional claims with integer arithmetic (`uint256`) can lead to tiny remainder amounts ("dust"), which is addressed by the `sweepDustEssence` function but is a common challenge.
*   **Complexity:** The interaction effects between Flux generation, Attunement, Resonance, and Claims can be complex to balance and audit thoroughly.
*   **Security:** While basic checks (`require`, `onlyOwner`) are included, a contract of this complexity requires extensive security review, formal verification, and penetration testing before deployment. Reentrancy is mitigated by simple transfers and state updates before external calls, but complex interactions would need OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
*   **View Functions for Mappings:** Several view functions (like `getPendingEntanglementRequests`, `getActiveEntanglementLinks`) are marked as conceptual because directly iterating over `mapping` keys in Solidity isn't straightforward or efficient. A real implementation would need to maintain separate arrays or linked lists of keys, or rely on off-chain indexing. The current implementation returns empty arrays for these as a placeholder.
*   **Mathematical Library:** Added a simple `Math` library for `min`. For more complex calculations, a robust library might be needed.

This contract provides a basis for a unique on-chain system exploring interactions between reputation, time-based value, dynamic parameters, and abstract social connections, going beyond the typical ERC-20/721/1155 standard functionalities.
