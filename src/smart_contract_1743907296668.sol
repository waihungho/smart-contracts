/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery with advanced features including dynamic NFT art,
 *      curation voting, community exhibitions, fractional ownership, artist support, and governance.
 *
 * Function Outline & Summary:
 *
 * --- Core Art NFT Functions ---
 * 1. mintArtNFT(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _initialDataURI): Allows artists to mint unique dynamic art NFTs.
 * 2. updateArtNFTDataURI(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _newDataURI): Artists can update the data URI of their NFTs, enabling dynamic art.
 * 3. transferArtNFT(address _to, uint256 _tokenId): Standard NFT transfer function.
 * 4. burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId): Allows NFT owners to burn their NFTs.
 * 5. getArtNFTMetadata(uint256 _tokenId): Retrieves metadata (title, description, data URI) of an NFT.
 *
 * --- Curation & Gallery Management ---
 * 6. submitArtForCuration(uint256 _tokenId): Artists submit their NFTs for curation in the gallery.
 * 7. voteOnArtCuration(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve): Curators vote to approve or reject submitted art.
 * 8. addCurator(address _curator): Contract owner can add new curators.
 * 9. removeCurator(address _curator): Contract owner can remove curators.
 * 10. setCurationThreshold(uint256 _threshold): Contract owner sets the required votes for art approval.
 * 11. getCurationSubmissionStatus(uint256 _submissionId): Check the status of a curation submission.
 *
 * --- Community Exhibition Functions ---
 * 12. createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime): Curators can create community exhibitions.
 * 13. addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId): Curators add approved NFTs to exhibitions.
 * 14. removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId): Curators can remove NFTs from exhibitions.
 * 15. startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Curators can manually start an exhibition before its scheduled time.
 * 16. endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Curators can manually end an exhibition before its scheduled time.
 * 17. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): View details of an exhibition, including art pieces.
 *
 * --- Fractional Ownership & Artist Support ---
 * 18. fractionalizeArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _numberOfFractions): NFT owners can fractionalize their NFTs into ERC20 tokens.
 * 19. redeemFractionalizedNFT(uint256 _tokenId): Allows holders of all fractions to redeem the original NFT.
 * 20. supportArtist(uint256 _tokenId) payable: Users can directly support the artist of an NFT by sending ETH.
 * 21. withdrawArtistSupportFunds(uint256 _tokenId): Artists can withdraw collected support funds for their NFTs.
 *
 * --- Governance & Utility Functions ---
 * 22. setGalleryName(string memory _name): Contract owner can set the gallery name.
 * 23. setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Contract owner can set a platform fee percentage for future features (e.g., sales - not implemented here, but as a placeholder for future extensions).
 * 24. withdrawPlatformFees(): Contract owner can withdraw accumulated platform fees (not applicable in this version, but for future).
 * 25. pauseContract(): Contract owner can pause core functionalities in case of emergency.
 * 26. unpauseContract(): Contract owner can unpause the contract.
