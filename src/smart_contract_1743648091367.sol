 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective,
 * enabling artists to submit, curate, and monetize digital art through NFTs and community governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Functionality:**
 * 1.  `submitArtwork(string _title, string _ipfsHash)`: Allows artists to submit artwork proposals with title and IPFS hash.
 * 2.  `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a submitted artwork.
 * 3.  `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 * 4.  `finalizeArtworkVoting(uint256 _artworkId)`: Closes voting for an artwork and processes the result.
 * 5.  `mintNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an NFT for approved artworks, transferring ownership to the artist.
 * 6.  `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Artist sets the price for their NFT artwork.
 * 7.  `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows anyone to purchase an artwork NFT.
 * 8.  `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Allows NFT owner to transfer ownership.
 * 9.  `burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows NFT owner to burn their artwork NFT.
 *
 * **Governance and Community Features:**
 * 10. `createProposal(string _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes _data)`: Members can create governance proposals.
 * 11. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members can vote on governance proposals.
 * 12. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal.
 * 13. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a governance proposal.
 * 14. `addMember(address _newMember)`: Owner/Admin function to add new members to the collective.
 * 15. `removeMember(address _member)`: Owner/Admin function to remove members from the collective.
 * 16. `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 * 17. `setVotingDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Owner/Admin function to set voting duration for proposals.
 * 18. `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _percentage)`: Owner/Admin function to set the quorum percentage for proposals.
 *
 * **Advanced and Creative Features:**
 * 19. `donateToArtist(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to donate ETH directly to the artist of a specific artwork.
 * 20. `createCollaborativeArtwork(string _title, string _ipfsHash, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Allows multiple artists to submit collaborative artwork, splitting royalties.
 * 21. `bidOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Introduces an auction system, allowing bids on artworks even before minting (concept for future development).
 * 22. `distributeRoyalties(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal function) Distributes royalties to artists and collaborators upon artwork sale.
