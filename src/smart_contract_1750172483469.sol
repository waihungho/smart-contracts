Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several concepts like layered access control, time-based locks, delegated permissions, simulated external conditions, and emergency procedures. We'll call it `QuantumVault` to represent the complex, multi-dimensional access logic.

It will store Ether and a single type of ERC20 token. Access and withdrawal will depend on a combination of:
1.  A time lock.
2.  A dynamic "access phase" value that must be matched.
3.  Potentially a simulated external condition being met.
4.  Permissions (Owner, Delegate, Guardian).

This setup is not a direct copy of standard open-source contracts (like basic time locks, simple multi-sigs, or ERC20 vaults) due to the *combination* of these specific access layers and roles.

**Smart Contract: QuantumVault**

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This contract is a multi-layered secure vault designed to hold ETH and a single designated ERC20 token. Access to withdraw assets is controlled by a combination of time locks, a dynamic "access phase" value, simulated external conditions, and distinct roles (Owner, Delegate, Guardian).

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Time Lock:** Assets are locked until a specific timestamp.
*   **Access Phase:** A dynamic value set by the owner. Withdrawals require providing the *current* correct phase value as a sort of dynamic password/key.
*   **Conditional Release:** An alternative withdrawal mechanism based on the time lock expiring *and* a simulated external value meeting a threshold set by the owner.
*   **Roles:**
    *   `Owner`: Full control, sets lock times, phase, conditions, delegates, guardians, standard withdrawals.
    *   `Delegate`: Can be assigned by the owner to trigger the *conditional release* withdrawal. Cannot manage vault settings.
    *   `Guardian`: An emergency role that can trigger a delayed emergency unlock, bypassing time lock and phase, but subject to a safety delay.
*   **Emergency Unlock:** A mechanism for the guardian (or owner) to initiate a time-delayed override of standard access controls.

**Function Categories:**

1.  **Deployment & Configuration (Owner Only):**
    *   `constructor(address _erc20Token)`: Initializes the contract, sets owner, and the target ERC20 token.
    *   `setAccessPhase(uint256 _newPhase)`: Sets the required value for phase-based access.
    *   `setConditionalReleaseThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: Sets the value required for the simulated external condition.
    *   `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard Ownable function to transfer ownership.
    *   `renounceOwnership()`: Standard Ownable function for owner to renounce ownership.

2.  **Deposits:**
    *   `depositEther()`: Deposits Ether into the vault (payable function).
    *   `depositERC20(uint256 amount)`: Deposits the designated ERC20 token (requires prior approval).

3.  **Locking & Time Control (Owner Only):**
    *   `lockVault(uint40 duration)`: Sets the lock duration from the current time.
    *   `extendLock(uint40 additionalDuration)`: Adds time to the *existing* lock end time.

4.  **Standard Withdrawals (Owner Only):**
    *   `ownerWithdrawEther(uint256 amount, uint256 currentPhase)`: Withdraws ETH, requires lock expired & correct phase.
    *   `ownerWithdrawERC20(uint256 amount, uint256 currentPhase)`: Withdraws ERC20, requires lock expired & correct phase.

5.  **Conditional Release (Owner or Delegate):**
    *   `simulateExternalValue(uint256 _simulatedValue)`: Owner updates the simulated external value.
    *   `triggerConditionalRelease(uint256 requiredPhase)`: Attempts withdrawal if lock expired, correct phase provided, *and* simulated external value meets threshold. Can be called by Owner or the assigned Delegate.

6.  **Delegation Management (Owner Only):**
    *   `delegateAccess(address _delegate)`: Sets the address allowed to trigger conditional release.
    *   `revokeDelegate()`: Removes the assigned delegate.

7.  **Guardian & Emergency Unlock (Owner & Guardian):**
    *   `setGuardian(address _guardian)`: Sets the emergency guardian address.
    *   `removeGuardian()`: Removes the guardian address.
    *   `renounceGuardian()`: Guardian self-removes.
    *   `guardianTriggerEmergencyUnlock()`: Guardian initiates the emergency unlock process, starting a delay timer. Bypasses time lock and phase checks.
    *   `claimEmergencyUnlockedEther()`: Claims ETH after the emergency unlock delay has passed. Callable by Owner or Guardian.
    *   `claimEmergencyUnlockedERC20()`: Claims ERC20 after the emergency unlock delay has passed. Callable by Owner or Guardian.

8.  **Information & Status:**
    *   `owner()`: Standard Ownable function to get owner address.
    *   `getLockEndTime()`: Gets the timestamp when the lock expires.
    *   `getVaultBalanceEther()`: Gets the current ETH balance of the contract.
    *   `getVaultBalanceERC20()`: Gets the current ERC20 balance of the contract.
    *   `getAccessPhase()`: Gets the currently required access phase value.
    *   `getConditionalReleaseThreshold()`: Gets the threshold for conditional release.
    *   `getSimulatedExternalValue()`: Gets the current simulated external value.
    *   `isDelegate(address account)`: Checks if an address is the current delegate.
    *   `isGuardian(address account)`: Checks if an address is the current guardian.
    *   `getGuardianUnlockTime()`: Gets the timestamp when emergency unlock is claimable.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Layered Access Control:** Instead of a single condition (like a time lock or password), access requires *multiple* conditions (`whenUnlocked`, `requireAccessPhaseMatch`) and specific *roles* (`onlyOwner`, `onlyDelegateOrOwner`). This multi-factor requirement is more complex than typical vaults.
2.  **Dynamic Access Phase:** Using `requiredAccessPhase` as a value that needs to be known and provided for withdrawal adds a "soft-key" or dynamic password element. The owner can change this "key" at any time using `setAccessPhase`, effectively revoking immediate access even if the time lock has expired, unless the user knows the new phase.
3.  **Simulated External Condition:** The `simulatedExternalValue` and `conditionalReleaseThreshold` mimic checking an external condition (like a price feed exceeding a threshold, a specific event occurring, etc.) before allowing a specific type of withdrawal (`triggerConditionalRelease`). In a real dApp, this would integrate with an oracle (like Chainlink). Here, it's simplified for demonstration but showcases the concept of conditional logic based on dynamic data.
4.  **Role Separation (Owner, Delegate, Guardian):** Differentiates permissions beyond just the owner. The Delegate has *one specific* withdrawal capability (`triggerConditionalRelease`), and the Guardian has an emergency override (`guardianTriggerEmergencyUnlock`, `claimEmergencyUnlocked*`) that works differently from standard withdrawals.
5.  **Emergency Unlock with Delay:** The guardian role doesn't grant immediate access. Triggering the emergency unlock starts a safety timer (`guardianUnlockTime`). This provides a window (e.g., 72 hours) where the owner can potentially react if the guardian's action was malicious or mistaken before funds can be claimed.
6.  **Explicit Withdrawal Methods:** Separate functions for owner standard withdrawal vs. conditional release vs. emergency claim clarify the different access paths and their associated conditions.
7.  **State Machine Hinting:** While not a full state machine, the `guardianUnlockTime` acts as a simple state indicator for the emergency process (0 = not initiated/claimed, > block.timestamp = pending, <= block.timestamp = claimable).

This contract goes beyond a basic time lock or simple multi-sig by combining these concepts into a more complex access management system, fitting the request for interesting, advanced, and creative features.
