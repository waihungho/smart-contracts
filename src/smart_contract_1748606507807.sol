Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept called "QuantumOracleMarket". This contract simulates a market where users can pose questions about complex, potentially non-deterministic future events (framed as "quantum" in a conceptual sense), provide probabilistic answers, and participate in a complex resolution process involving staking, evidence, and reputation, aiming to reach consensus or verify against a designated "oracle" role.

It's designed to be distinct from standard DeFi or NFT contracts by focusing on a novel, multi-stage prediction/data resolution mechanism for uncertain outcomes.

/// @title QuantumOracleMarket
/// @dev A decentralized market for posing and resolving questions about complex, uncertain future events.
/// Users stake tokens on questions and proposed answers, provide evidence, and participate in a multi-stage
/// resolution process guided by a designated 'Quantum Oracle' role and community consensus/challenges.
/// Rewards are distributed based on supporting the final, verified outcome. Reputation is tracked.
///
/// **Outline:**
/// 1.  State Variables & Data Structures: Enums for states, structs for Question, Answer, Evidence. Mappings for storage.
/// 2.  Events: Announce key state changes and actions.
/// 3.  Modifiers: Control access and function execution based on state or role.
/// 4.  Admin/Setup Functions: Owner-controlled configuration (fees, oracle address, pausing).
/// 5.  Question Management: Create, stake on, and potentially cancel questions.
/// 6.  Answer & Evidence Submission: Provide answers and supporting evidence.
/// 7.  Resolution Process: Multi-stage mechanism involving proposal, challenge, voting, and finalization.
/// 8.  Claiming: Users claim stakes and rewards.
/// 9.  Reputation System: Track and update user reputation based on successful participation.
/// 10. View Functions: Read contract state.
/// 11. Internal Helper Functions: Logic for reward calculation, slashing, state transitions.
///
/// **Function Summary:**
/// - **Admin/Setup:**
///   - `constructor`: Deploys contract, sets token, owner, initial oracle.
///   - `setFeePercentage`: Allows owner to set protocol fee.
///   - `withdrawFees`: Allows owner to withdraw collected fees.
///   - `setQuantumOracleAddress`: Allows owner to change the address designated as the 'Quantum Oracle'.
///   - `pause`: Pauses contract operations (emergency).
///   - `unpause`: Unpauses contract operations.
/// - **Question Management:**
///   - `createQuestion`: Users propose a new question, depositing required stake. Sets state to `Answering`.
///   - `stakeOnQuestion`: Users add additional stake to an existing question, increasing its pool and visibility.
///   - `cancelQuestion`: Creator can cancel an open question if no answers have been submitted.
/// - **Answer & Evidence Submission:**
///   - `submitAnswer`: Users propose an answer to an open question, depositing required stake.
///   - `submitEvidence`: Users link external evidence (e.g., IPFS hash) to an answer, potentially with a small stake.
///   - `supportAnswer`: Users stake tokens on an answer they believe is correct.
/// - **Resolution Process:**
///   - `proposeResolution`: The designated 'Quantum Oracle' proposes a final resolution (specific answer ID) for a question that is in `Answering` or `ResolutionProposed` state (allows re-proposal if challenged). Requires linked evidence/justification. Sets state to `ResolutionProposed`.
///   - `challengeResolution`: Users challenge the proposed resolution, depositing a challenge stake. Sets state to `ResolutionChallenged`.
///   - `voteOnResolutionChallenge`: Users (potentially weighted by reputation or stake) vote on the validity of a challenged resolution.
///   - `finalizeResolution`: Callable after resolution challenge period/voting ends. Determines the final outcome, distributes stakes/rewards, applies penalties/slashing, updates reputation. Sets state to `Resolved`.
///   - `submitOracleDataPoint`: Allows the 'Quantum Oracle' role to submit a specific data point or value relevant to a question's outcome before proposing a final resolution. Useful for time-based questions.
/// - **Claiming:**
///   - `claimWinnings`: Users who supported the correct answer claim their share of the reward pool.
///   - `claimStakedTokens`: Users claim back their initial stake from questions that were cancelled, or their supporting stake if their supported answer won (initial stake + share of pool).
/// - **Reputation System:**
///   - `updateReputationScore`: Internal function called during `finalizeResolution` to adjust user reputation based on outcome.
///   - `getUserReputation`: View function to check a user's current reputation score.
///   - `setBaseReputation`: Owner function to set the initial reputation for a new user or a special address.
/// - **View Functions:**
///   - `getQuestionDetails`: Retrieve details about a specific question.
///   - `getAnswersForQuestion`: Retrieve details of all answers submitted for a question.
///   - `getEvidenceForAnswer`: Retrieve linked evidence for a specific answer.
///   - `getQuestionState`: Get the current state of a question.
///   - `getResolutionDetails`: Get details about the current or proposed resolution.
///   - `getTotalStakedOnQuestion`: Get the total amount staked on a question (initial + additional).
///   - `getTotalStakedOnAnswer`: Get the total amount staked supporting a specific answer.
///   - `isQuestionResolved`: Check if a question has reached the `Resolved` state.
///   - `getFeePercentage`: Get the current protocol fee percentage.

    // Let's stick with the simpler model *without* iterating stakers on-chain for this example to keep complexity manageable within a single file response.
    // The `_distributeRewards` function as written relies on iterating through `Answer.stakers`, which isn't implemented in the simplified structs.
    // The `claimableAmounts` mapping becomes the key. We just need `_distributeRewards` to correctly calculate and populate it.

    // Simplified _distributeRewards Calculation:
    // 1. Calculate total pool: Sum of all stakes (question + answer support + challenge)
    // 2. Calculate fee. Subtract from pool.
    // 3. Calculate total winning stake (sum of support stakes on the winning answer).
    // 4. Iterate through all answers.
    // 5. For each answer, iterate through its stakers (still need a way to do this or map stakers globally per question).
    // 6. If staker supported winning answer: calculate their proportional payout from pool and add to claimableAmounts. Award reputation.
    // 7. If staker supported losing answer: lose stake (it's in the pool), penalize reputation.
    // 8. If challenger failed: lose stake (in pool), penalize reputation (needs challenger address tracking).
    // 9. Initial question stakers (who didn't stake on answers) get their stake back via `claimStakedTokens` if Q is Resolved/Cancelled.


    // Let's refine claimable amounts:
    // `claimableAmounts[user][questionId]` = Total amount user can claim for this question (initial stakes + winnings).
    // In finalizeResolution (Resolved state):
    // - Calculate total payout pool (total_stakes - fees).
    // - For each user who staked on the winning answer: `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += (userStakeOnWinningAnswer / totalWinningStake) * payoutPool`. This includes their original stake + profit. Award reputation.
    // - For each user who staked on a losing answer: `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`. Their answer stake is lost. Penalize reputation.
    // - For initial question stakers who didn't stake on any answer: `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`.
    // - If challenge failed: penalize challenger reputation. Challenge stake goes to fees.
    // In finalizeResolution (Cancelled state):
    // - For each user who staked on the question (initial + support): `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += userTotalStakeForQuestion`. Refund all. No reputation change.

    // This requires tracking ALL unique stakers per question and their breakdown of stakes (question vs. answer support).
    // This is complex state management on-chain.

    // --- Final Simplified Claiming/Distribution Model for Example ---
    // - `claimableAmounts[user][questionId]` = Total tokens user can claim for a question.
    // - In `finalizeResolution` (RESOLVED):
    //   - Calculate total pool (all stakes - fees).
    //   - For each user who staked on the winning answer: `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += (userStakeOnWinningAnswer / totalWinningStake) * Pool`. (Includes principal+profit). Award reputation.
    //   - All other stakes (losing answer stakes, failed challenge stake) are lost (implicitly go to fees/winning pool). Penalize losing stakers/challenger reputation.
    //   - Initial question stakes are also lost unless they staked on the winning answer. (Simplified: Only winning answer stakers get payout).
    // - In `finalizeResolution` (CANCELLED):
    //   - For each user who staked *at all* on this question (initial question stake OR answer support stake): `claimableAmounts[user][qId] += their total stake on this question`. Refund all.
    // - `claimTotalForQuestion(questionId)` function: allows user to claim their `claimableAmounts[user][qId]` if > 0.

    // This requires knowing ALL users who staked on a question. Still hard.

    // Let's revert to a slightly less complex model:
    // `claimableWinnings[user][questionId]`: stores just the *profit* amount for winning stakers.
    // `claimableStakes[user][questionId]`: stores the *initial* stake amounts that can be reclaimed (initial question stake + initial answer support stake if they won or Q cancelled).

    // In `_distributeRewards` (RESOLVED):
    //   - Calculate `rewardPoolFromLosing` (losing stakes + failed challenge stake - fees).
    //   - For each winning staker: `claimableWinnings[user][qId] += (userStakeOnWinningAnswer / totalWinningStake) * rewardPoolFromLosing`. Award reputation.
    //   - For each winning staker: `claimableStakes[user][qId] += userStakeOnWinningAnswer`. Return their principal.
    //   - Losing stakers: Stake is lost. Penalize reputation.
    //   - Initial question stakers: `claimableStakes[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`. Return their initial question stake regardless of answer outcome.
    //   - Failed Challenger: Stake lost. Penalize reputation.

    // In `finalizeResolution` (CANCELLED):
    //   - For each user who staked on question: `claimableStakes[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`.
    //   - For each user who staked on any answer: `claimableStakes[user][qId] += userAnswerStake`. (Need to sum for all answers).

    // This requires iterating through all stakers per question/answer again.
    // The most practical on-chain approach avoids iterating unknown mapping keys or large dynamic arrays.
    // Users just claim what the contract state *knows* they are owed based on their address and the question/answer IDs they interacted with.

    // Simplified Claim Functions:
    // `claimForQuestion(questionId)`: User calls this. Contract calculates total claimable for THIS user for THIS question based on stored stakes and question state.
    // This requires recalculating or accessing pre-calculated amounts per user/question.

    // Final attempt at simplified claim state:
    // `mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public userTotalClaimable;` // Total claimable amount for user per question

    // In `_distributeRewards` (RESOLVED):
    //   - Calculate `rewardPoolFromLosing`.
    //   - For each winning staker: `userTotalClaimable[user][qId] += userStakeOnWinningAnswer + ((userStakeOnWinningAnswer / totalWinningStake) * rewardPoolFromLosing)`. Award reputation.
    //   - For each initial question staker (who didn't stake on winning answer): `userTotalClaimable[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`.
    //   - Losing stakers/Failed challenger: Penalize reputation. Their stakes are absorbed.
    // In `finalizeResolution` (CANCELLED):
    //   - For each initial question staker: `userTotalClaimable[user][qId] += userInitialQuestionStake`.
    //   - For each answer staker: `userTotalClaimable[user][qId] += userAnswerStake`. (Need to sum across answers).

    // This requires tracking initial question stakers and answer stakers separately or iterating. Still complex.

    // Let's make claiming simple from the user's perspective, even if the state calculation is manual or assumes iteration is somehow handled off-chain or via helpers.
    // We'll use the `claimableAmounts` mapping.

    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public claimableAmounts; // Total amount (stake + winnings) user can claim per question

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **"Quantum Oracle" Concept:** While not *actually* using quantum computation on-chain (which is impossible on EVM), the contract frames the challenge of resolving questions about inherently complex, uncertain future outcomes (like scientific breakthroughs, market shifts driven by unpredictable factors, etc.) as interacting with a "Quantum Oracle". This Oracle isn't just a simple data feed; it's a designated role (`quantumOracleAddress`) that *proposes* resolutions based on potentially complex off-chain data or analysis, which then must survive a decentralized *challenge* process. This adds a layer of abstraction and novelty.
2.  **Multi-Stage Resolution:** Unlike simple prediction markets with fixed resolution sources, this contract implements a `ResolutionProposed` -> `ResolutionChallenged` -> `Finalized` flow. The Oracle proposes, users can challenge, and *potentially* community voting or lack of challenge validates the outcome. This mirrors decentralized scientific processes (peer review) or complex governance models more than simple data feeds.
3.  **Evidence Layer:** Users can submit external evidence (via IPFS hash) to support answers or challenges. This recognizes that complex questions require external data and justification, not just on-chain actions.
4.  **Reputation System:** User reputation (`userReputation`) is tracked and updated based on the success/failure of their participation (supporting winning answers, correct/incorrect challenge votes - although complex voting wasn't fully implemented due to iteration limits). This allows for potential future features like weighted voting, expert roles, or tiered rewards based on proven accuracy.
5.  **Probabilistic/Complex Questions:** The design is intended for questions where the outcome isn't a simple binary YES/NO based on a single price feed, but might be a specific value, a complex state, or the result of a long-term process requiring interpretation and evidence. While the `answerText` is a string, the *process* of validating it is built for complexity.
6.  **Staking on Multiple Levels:** Users stake not just on the outcome, but potentially on the question itself (visibility/importance), specific answers (belief in correctness), and even challenges (belief the Oracle is wrong). This creates a layered incentive/game theory model.
7.  **On-chain State Management for Complex Objects:** The contract manages multiple interconnected structs (`Question`, `Answer`, `EvidenceLink`) and tracks relationships between them, along with user stakes across these objects.

**Caveats and Potential Improvements for Production:**

*   **Iteration Limitation:** Solidity's inability to efficiently iterate mapping keys (`userQuestionStakes`, `userAnswerStakes`, `Answer.supportStakes` etc. if not manually tracked in arrays) makes calculating distributions and totals across many users/stakes difficult and expensive on-chain. The simplified model uses conceptual loops or assumes `claimableAmounts` is populated via helper functions or off-chain processes calling a distribution function. A real production version would need careful state design (e.g., linked lists or tracking stakers in arrays) or rely heavily on off-chain calculation + on-chain verification/claiming.
*   **Challenge Voting Complexity:** The simple reputation-based voting `voteOnResolutionChallenge` lacks features like vote weighting by stake on the challenge itself, vote delegation, or preventing vote changes.
*   **Detailed Slashing/Penalties:** The penalty system is simple reputation reduction. Real contracts might slash stakes of losing answer stakers or failed challengers more explicitly.
*   **Gas Costs:** Complex state updates and array manipulations (even conceptual ones) can be gas-intensive.
*   **Oracle Trust:** While challenged, the 'Quantum Oracle' role still holds significant power in *proposing* the initial resolution. The system relies on the challenge mechanism to mitigate a malicious oracle.
*   **Scalability:** Storing large numbers of questions, answers, and evidence links directly on-chain can become expensive.

This contract provides a framework for a complex prediction/resolution market on-chain, going beyond simple price feeds or binary outcomes, and incorporating elements of reputation, evidence, and multi-stakeholder resolution, while acknowledging the current limitations of EVM for complex state iteration.
