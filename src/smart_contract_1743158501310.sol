 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit proposals,
 *      community voting on artworks, fractional ownership of art NFTs, AI-assisted art curation,
 *      and dynamic royalty distribution.

 * **Contract Outline:**

 * **State Variables:**
 *   - `owner`: Contract owner address.
 *   - `artProposals`: Mapping of proposal IDs to ArtProposal structs.
 *   - `proposalCount`: Counter for art proposals.
 *   - `members`: Mapping of member addresses to boolean (isMember).
 *   - `memberCount`: Counter for members.
 *   - `votingPeriod`: Duration of voting period in blocks.
 *   - `quorumPercentage`: Percentage of members required for quorum in voting.
 *   - `aiCurationModelAddress`: Address of the AI Curation Model contract (external).
 *   - `treasuryBalance`: Contract's ETH balance.
 *   - `fractionalOwnershipRegistry`: Address of the Fractional Ownership Registry contract (external).

 *   - `royaltyRates`: Mapping of art proposal IDs to royalty percentages.
 *   - `dynamicRoyaltyCurve`: Address of the Dynamic Royalty Curve contract (external).

 * **Structs:**
 *   - `ArtProposal`: Represents an art proposal with details like artist, title, description, IPFS hash,
 *                    submission date, voting status, votes, and AI curation score.

 * **Modifiers:**
 *   - `onlyOwner`: Restricts function access to the contract owner.
 *   - `onlyMember`: Restricts function access to members of the collective.
 *   - `proposalExists`: Checks if an art proposal with a given ID exists.
 *   - `votingActive`: Checks if voting is currently active for a proposal.
 *   - `votingClosed`: Checks if voting is closed for a proposal.
 *   - `quorumReached`: Checks if quorum is reached for a proposal.

 * **Events:**
 *   - `ProposalSubmitted`: Emitted when a new art proposal is submitted.
 *   - `ProposalVoted`: Emitted when a member votes on a proposal.
 *   - `ProposalApproved`: Emitted when a proposal is approved through voting.
 *   - `ProposalRejected`: Emitted when a proposal is rejected through voting.
 *   - `MemberJoined`: Emitted when a new member joins the collective.
 *   - `MemberLeft`: Emitted when a member leaves the collective.
 *   - `RoyaltyRateUpdated`: Emitted when the royalty rate for an artwork is updated.
 *   - `FundsDonated`: Emitted when funds are donated to the collective.
 *   - `FundsWithdrawn`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn from the collective.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Concept:**  The contract embodies the idea of a community-driven art collective, moving beyond simple art marketplaces to a more democratic and collaborative approach.

2.  **Art Proposal and Voting System:**  Members can submit art proposals, and other members can vote on them. This is a core DAO concept, decentralizing curation and decision-making.

3.  **Quorum-Based Voting:**  Voting requires a quorum (minimum percentage of members participating) to ensure sufficient community engagement for decisions to be valid.

4.  **AI Curation Model Integration (External Contract):**
    *   The contract is designed to interact with an external AI Curation Model contract (`aiCurationModelAddress`).
    *   The `callAICurationModel` function (currently simplified for demonstration) is intended to trigger an AI to analyze art proposals (e.g., based on IPFS hash content) and provide a curation score.
    *   This introduces the trendy concept of using AI in decentralized systems for enhanced decision-making or analysis.

5.  **Fractional Ownership of Art NFTs (External Contract):**
    *   The contract integrates with an external Fractional Ownership Registry contract (`fractionalOwnershipRegistry`).
    *   `fractionalizeArtNFT` function (simplified) is designed to enable fractionalizing ownership of Art NFTs. This is a very trendy and advanced concept in the NFT space, allowing for shared ownership and potentially increased liquidity of valuable digital art.

6.  **Dynamic Royalty Rates (External Contract & Curve):**
    *   The contract interacts with a Dynamic Royalty Curve contract (`dynamicRoyaltyCurveAddress`).
    *   `updateRoyaltyRate` function (simplified) aims to dynamically adjust royalty rates for artworks based on factors determined by the external curve contract (e.g., market demand, popularity, etc.).
    *   This introduces a more sophisticated and potentially fairer royalty system compared to static royalty percentages, aligning with trends in dynamic pricing and revenue models.

7.  **External NFT Contract (`nftContractAddress`):**
    *   The contract is designed to work with an external NFT contract for minting Art NFTs (`mintArtNFT` function - simplified). This promotes modularity and allows for using specialized or existing NFT contracts.

8.  **Membership System:**  The contract includes a basic membership system (`joinCollective`, `leaveCollective`) to define who can participate in the collective's governance and art submission processes.

9.  **Treasury Management:**  The contract has a simple treasury (`donateToCollective`, `withdrawFunds`, `getTreasuryBalance`) allowing the collective to manage funds, potentially for supporting artists, community initiatives, or operational costs.

10. **Owner-Controlled Settings:**  The owner can configure important parameters like voting period, quorum percentage, and addresses of external contracts, providing initial control while allowing for potential future decentralization of these settings through governance proposals.

**Key Improvements and Considerations for Real-World Deployment:**

*   **External Contract Interfaces:**  For robust interaction with external contracts (AI Curation Model, NFT Contract, Fractional Ownership Registry, Dynamic Royalty Curve), you would need to define proper Solidity interfaces for these contracts and use them in the DAAC contract. This would ensure type safety and proper function calls.
*   **Error Handling and Security:**  The code includes basic `require` statements, but for production, you would need more comprehensive error handling, security audits, and considerations for vulnerabilities like reentrancy (though less likely in this specific example but always good practice to consider).
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For complex logic or interactions with external contracts, gas optimization would be crucial to reduce transaction costs.
*   **Event Handling:**  More detailed and informative events should be emitted throughout the contract's execution to improve off-chain monitoring and integration with user interfaces.
*   **Decentralized Governance Evolution:**  While the contract starts with owner control for some settings, a real DAAC would likely evolve to have more decentralized governance mechanisms where members could propose and vote on changes to voting periods, quorum, or even the external contract addresses.
*   **AI Curation Model Implementation:** The `callAICurationModel` is highly simplified. A real AI Curation Model would be a significant project in itself, possibly involving off-chain AI processing and then on-chain verification or submission of scores.
*   **Fractional Ownership Registry and NFT Contract Integration:**  The interaction with these external contracts is simplified.  Real integration would require careful design of function calls, data passing, and handling of return values and potential errors.
*   **Dynamic Royalty Curve Logic:** The `updateRoyaltyRate` function is a placeholder. A real Dynamic Royalty Curve contract would need to implement a specific algorithm to calculate royalties based on relevant factors.
*   **Off-Chain Components:**  For features like AI curation or more complex governance, you might need to consider off-chain components (e.g., oracles, decentralized storage, off-chain computation) to support the smart contract logic.

This contract provides a solid foundation and a creative starting point for building a more advanced and feature-rich Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective. Remember to thoroughly test, audit, and consider security implications before deploying any smart contract to a production environment.
