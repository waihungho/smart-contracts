Okay, let's design a smart contract that models a conceptual "Quantum Lock" which holds funds and can only be unlocked under complex, state-dependent conditions influenced by simulated quantum mechanics principles like superposition, entanglement, measurement, decoherence, and tunneling.

This contract is purely *conceptual* and uses blockchain properties (like block hash, timestamp, caller, etc.) to *simulate* probabilistic and state-dependent behavior, as true quantum phenomena cannot occur on a deterministic blockchain. It's designed to be complex and non-standard, fulfilling the request for an advanced, creative concept with many functions.

**QuantumLock Smart Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **Pragma and Imports:** Specify Solidity version and potentially external libraries (though none strictly needed for this concept).
2.  **Enums:** Define possible states of the Quantum Lock.
3.  **State Variables:** Store the contract's state, configuration parameters, linked contracts, observers, and balance.
4.  **Events:** Announce important state changes and actions.
5.  **Modifiers:** Define access control and state requirements.
6.  **Configuration Variables:** Parameters influencing state transitions (decoherence rate, tunneling chance, measurement cost).
7.  **Core Logic:**
    *   Constructor: Initialize the owner.
    *   Receive Function: Allow receiving Ether.
    *   State Management Functions: Initiate superposition, entanglement, trigger decoherence, attempt measurement, attempt collapse.
    *   Observer Management: Add/remove addresses that can participate in 'measurement'.
    *   Linked Lock Management: Set an address of another QuantumLock contract for 'entanglement'.
    *   Configuration Functions: Set parameters for the quantum simulation.
    *   Query/View Functions: Get current state, balance, parameters, check conditions, etc. (many of these to meet the 20+ function requirement).
    *   Withdrawal Functions: Allow withdrawing funds *only* when the state is 'Unlocked'.
8.  **Internal/Helper Functions:** Logic for simulating outcomes, checking state transition conditions.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
2.  `receive()`: Allows the contract to receive Ether deposits. Increments balance and emits `Deposit` event.
3.  `initiateSuperposition()`: Callable by owner or under specific initial conditions. Sets the state to `Superposition`.
4.  `setLinkedLock(address _linkedLock)`: Callable by owner. Sets the address of another `QuantumLock` contract for potential entanglement simulation.
5.  `initiateEntanglement()`: Callable by owner or under specific state conditions (e.g., from `Superposition`). Sets the state to `Entangled`. Requires a linked lock to be set.
6.  `addObserver(address _observer)`: Callable by owner. Adds an address that can participate in the 'measurement' process.
7.  `removeObserver(address _observer)`: Callable by owner. Removes an address from the observer list.
8.  `triggerDecoherence()`: Callable by anyone. Simulates environmental interaction. Checks if conditions (e.g., time elapsed in Superposition/Entangled) meet the configured `decoherenceRate`. Transitions state to `Decohered` if conditions met.
9.  `attemptMeasurement()`: Callable only by an added observer. Requires the state to be `Decohered`. Requires payment of `measurementCost`. Simulates a probabilistic outcome based on blockchain data and potentially the state of a linked lock if entangled. Transitions state based on the simulated outcome (e.g., to `Measured` or `Collapsed`). Refunds excess payment.
10. `attemptCollapse()`: Callable by anyone. Requires the state to be `Measured` or potentially other states under specific conditions. Simulates another interaction causing state to potentially collapse to `Unlocked` or `QuantumLocked`.
11. `attemptQuantumTunneling()`: Callable by anyone. Has a low, configured probability (`tunnelingChance`) of transitioning the state directly from `QuantumLocked`, `Superposition`, or `Entangled` to `Unlocked`, bypassing other steps. Uses blockchain data for probability simulation.
12. `setDecoherenceRate(uint256 _rateSeconds)`: Callable by owner. Sets the minimum time in Superposition/Entangled state required to trigger decoherence.
13. `setTunnelingChance(uint256 _chanceOneInN)`: Callable by owner. Sets the probability base for tunneling (e.g., 10000 for 1 in 10000).
14. `setMeasurementCost(uint256 _cost)`: Callable by owner. Sets the required Ether amount to attempt measurement.
15. `withdraw(uint256 _amount)`: Callable by anyone. Allows withdrawing a specified amount *only* if the current state is `Unlocked`.
16. `withdrawAll()`: Callable by anyone. Allows withdrawing the entire balance *only* if the current state is `Unlocked`.
17. `getContractBalance()`: View function. Returns the current Ether balance of the contract.
18. `getCurrentState()`: View function. Returns the current `QuantumState` enum value.
19. `getTimeInCurrentState()`: View function. Returns the duration (in seconds) the contract has been in the current state.
20. `isObserver(address _addr)`: View function. Checks if an address is currently registered as an observer.
21. `getObserverCount()`: View function. Returns the total number of registered observers.
22. `getLinkedLock()`: View function. Returns the address of the linked QuantumLock contract.
23. `getDecoherenceRate()`: View function. Returns the configured decoherence rate (in seconds).
24. `getTunnelingChance()`: View function. Returns the configured tunneling chance base (OneInN).
25. `getMeasurementCost()`: View function. Returns the configured measurement cost.
26. `canDecohereNow()`: View function. Returns true if the conditions are met to trigger decoherence based on time and state.
27. `canMeasureNow(address _addr)`: View function. Returns true if the address is an observer and the state is `Decohered`.
28. `canCollapseNow()`: View function. Returns true if the state is `Measured`.
29. `isUnlocked()`: View function. Returns true if the current state is `Unlocked`.
30. `getSimulatedOutcomeSeed()`: View function. Returns the current pseudo-random seed calculated from block data, useful for external verification/understanding of `attemptMeasurement` mechanics.
