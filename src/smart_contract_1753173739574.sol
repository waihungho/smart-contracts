This smart contract, "QuantumLeap DAO," is designed to be an advanced, adaptive, and gamified decentralized autonomous organization. It goes beyond standard DAO functionality by incorporating concepts like self-optimizing governance parameters, an epoch-based reputation system ("Karma Points"), oracle-dependent proposals, and an interface for privacy-preserving feedback via Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

# QuantumLeap DAO: Self-Optimizing Governance & Epoch-Based Reputation

## Outline

I.  **Introduction & Vision**
    *   QuantumLeap DAO aims to create a highly resilient, adaptive, and meritocratic governance system. It learns from past decisions and community engagement to dynamically adjust its own operating parameters, fostering continuous improvement and resistance to common DAO pitfalls.

II. **Core Components**
    *   **A. Governance Token (`QLEAPToken`):** An ERC-20 token serving as the primary medium for voting power and staking.
    *   **B. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Core:**
        *   Standard proposal creation, voting, and execution.
        *   Delegated voting for liquid democracy.
        *   Emergency pausing mechanism.
    *   **C. Epoch & Karma System (Reputation):**
        *   Time-bound "Epochs" during which members register participation.
        *   "Karma Points" accumulated by staking, voting, and completing on-chain/off-chain challenges.
        *   Karma influences voting power (beyond simple token weight) and future rewards.
    *   **D. Adaptive Governance Engine:**
        *   Automated or proposal-driven adjustment of core DAO parameters (e.g., voting period, quorum, proposal thresholds) based on epoch performance, voter turnout, and proposal success rates.
        *   `finalizeAndAdvanceEpoch` function acts as the "brain" for this adaptation.
    *   **E. Advanced Modules:**
        *   **Oracle-Dependent Proposals:** Proposals whose execution is contingent on a verifiable external data feed.
        *   **Anonymous Feedback/Proof Interface:** Allows users to submit verifiable (via ZK-proof hash) but anonymous data or feedback, preserving privacy while contributing to DAO intelligence.
        *   **DAO Bounties:** A structured way for the DAO to fund specific tasks or challenges.

III. **Upgradeability**
    *   Utilizes a UUPS proxy pattern for secure and flexible contract upgrades, ensuring the DAO can evolve its logic without migrating state or tokens.

IV. **Security & Considerations**
    *   Reentrancy protection, access control, and pause functionality are included.
    *   Acknowledgement that complex adaptive logic and ZK-proof verification would often rely on off-chain computation and oracle networks for full-scale implementation.

## Function Summary (20+ Functions)

1.  `initialize(address _qleapTokenAddress, uint256 _initialEpochDuration, uint256 _initialMinStake, uint256 _initialQuorumPercentage, uint256 _initialProposalThresholdPercentage)`: Initializes the DAO with essential parameters, callable only once.
2.  `createProposal(string calldata _description, address _target, bytes calldata _callData, uint256 _duration)`: Creates a new governance proposal.
3.  `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal.
4.  `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on proposal.
5.  `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Delegates voting power to another address.
6.  `undelegateVote()`: Revokes previously delegated voting power.
7.  `depositTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: Allows anyone to deposit QLEAP tokens into the DAO treasury.
8.  `withdrawTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Withdraws funds from the treasury (only via proposal execution).
9.  `stakeForKarma(uint256 _amount)`: Stakes QLEAP tokens to earn Karma points and enhance voting power.
10. `unstakeKarma(uint256 _amount)`: Unstakes QLEAP tokens, potentially reducing Karma.
11. `registerForCurrentEpoch()`: Members opt-in to participate in the current epoch's karma calculations and rewards.
12. `finalizeAndAdvanceEpoch()`: A crucial function that concludes the current epoch, calculates Karma, potentially distributes epoch rewards, and *adapts DAO parameters based on epoch performance*.
13. `proposeAdaptiveParameterChange(string calldata _description, bytes calldata _paramUpdateData)`: A special proposal type for DAO members to vote on updates to the DAO's core parameters (e.g., quorum, voting period).
14. `initiateOracleDependentProposal(string calldata _description, address _target, bytes calldata _callData, address _oracleAddress, bytes calldata _oracleQueryData, bytes calldata _expectedResult, uint256 _resolutionWindow)`: Creates a proposal whose execution is contingent on an oracle's report.
15. `resolveOracleDependentProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bytes calldata _oracleResult)`: Called by the trusted oracle or an authorized relayer to provide the result for an oracle-dependent proposal, triggering its execution if criteria are met.
16. `submitAnonymousFeedback(bytes32 _zkProofHash)`: Allows submission of a hash representing a Zero-Knowledge Proof, indicating anonymous feedback or data without revealing identity.
17. `proposeDAOBounty(string calldata _description, uint256 _rewardAmount, address _proposer, bytes32 _challengeIdentifier)`: Creates a proposal for a new DAO bounty, specifying a task and reward.
18. `fulfillDAOBounty(uint256 _proposalId, bytes32 _challengeProof)`: Allows a user to claim a bounty after completing the associated challenge, subject to verification (e.g., off-chain proof hash).
19. `emergencyPause()`: Pauses core DAO functions (e.g., proposal creation, voting, execution) in case of an emergency.
20. `unpause()`: Unpauses the DAO functions.
21. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newPeriod)`: Sets the duration for new proposals (only callable via successful governance proposal or adaptive engine).
22. `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage)`: Sets the percentage of total voting power required for a proposal to pass (callable via governance).
23. `setMinStakeForProposal(uint256 _newMinStake)`: Sets the minimum QLEAP tokens required to create a proposal.
24. `setEpochManager(address _newManager)`: Assigns an address permitted to call `finalizeAndAdvanceEpoch` (e.g., a trusted bot or multisig).
25. `_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)`: Internal function for UUPS upgradeability, controlled by DAO governance.
