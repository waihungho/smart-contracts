Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced and creative concepts: a "Decentralized Outcome Predictor & Insight Market" (DOPIM).

This contract allows users to propose and stake on the outcomes of future real-world events. It includes features like:

1.  **Event Lifecycle:** Events go through stages (proposed, approved, staking, resolving, resolved).
2.  **Staking:** Users stake an ERC20 token on specific outcomes.
3.  **Decentralized Resolution:** A system for submitting and potentially validating the actual outcome.
4.  **Insight NFTs:** Users can earn unique, dynamic NFTs that track their prediction accuracy and reputation.
5.  **Reputation System:** A score based on successful predictions.
6.  **Fee Distribution:** Fees are collected from incorrect predictions and potentially distributed.
7.  **Proposer Rewards:** Incentivizing users to propose relevant events.
8.  **Admin Controls:** Owner/resolver functions for managing events and parameters.

It aims to be distinct by combining prediction market mechanics with a reputation-linked, dynamic NFT system and a specific event resolution flow.

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This contract manages decentralized prediction events, user staking, outcome resolution, and associated reputation/NFTs.

**I. Data Structures & State**
*   `EventState`: Enum defining the lifecycle of an event.
*   `Outcome`: Struct holding details for a single outcome of an event.
*   `Event`: Struct holding all data for a prediction event.
*   `UserPrediction`: Struct tracking a user's stake and claim status for an event.
*   `InsightNFTData`: Struct holding dynamic data for an Insight NFT.
*   `events`: Mapping from event ID to Event data.
*   `userStakes`: Mapping from event ID, user address, to UserPrediction data.
*   `insightNFTs`: Mapping from NFT ID to InsightNFTData.
*   `userInsightNFT`: Mapping from user address to their NFT ID (assuming 1 NFT per user).
*   `insightNFTCounter`: Counter for issuing new NFT IDs.
*   `reputationScores`: Mapping from user address to their prediction reputation score.
*   `registeredResolvers`: Mapping allowing multiple addresses to submit outcomes.
*   `eventCounter`: Counter for new event IDs.
*   `predictionToken`: ERC20 token used for staking.
*   `insightNFTContract`: ERC721 contract address for Insight NFTs.
*   `feePercentage`: Percentage fee taken from losing stakes.
*   `proposerRewardPercentage`: Percentage of total staked rewarded to the proposer of a resolved event.
*   `stakingPeriodDuration`, `resolutionPeriodDuration`: Timestamps for event stages.
*   `minimumStakeAmount`: Minimum amount required to stake.
*   `collectedFees`: Total fees collected by the contract.

**II. Event Lifecycle Functions**
1.  `proposeEvent(string memory _title, string memory _description, string[] memory _outcomeDescriptions, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows anyone to propose a new prediction event. Requires a bond (conceptually, or handled off-chain).
2.  `approveEvent(uint256 _eventId)`: Owner/Resolver approves a proposed event, moving it to the Staking state and setting start times.
3.  `rejectEvent(uint256 _eventId)`: Owner/Resolver rejects a proposed event.
4.  `cancelEvent(uint256 _eventId)`: Owner/Resolver cancels an approved event, allowing users to claim stakes back.

**III. Staking & Prediction Functions**
5.  `stakeOnOutcome(uint256 _eventId, uint256 _outcomeIndex, uint256 _amount)`: Users stake the prediction token on a specific outcome.
6.  `unstakeFromOutcome(uint256 _eventId)`: Allows users to unstake their tokens *before* the staking period ends, potentially with a penalty.

**IV. Outcome Resolution & Claiming Functions**
7.  `submitActualOutcome(uint256 _eventId, uint256 _winningOutcomeIndex)`: Owner or a registered resolver submits the true outcome after the event ends. Finalizes the event state.
8.  `claimWinnings(uint256 _eventId)`: Users who staked on the correct outcome claim their proportional share of the losing stakes (minus fees). Updates NFT and reputation.
9.  `claimStakesBack(uint256 _eventId)`: Users who staked on incorrect outcomes, or for a cancelled event, claim their original stake back. Updates NFT and reputation.
10. `distributeEventProposerReward(uint256 _eventId)`: Allows the proposer of a resolved event to claim their reward.

**V. Insight NFT & Reputation Functions**
11. `issueInsightNFT()`: Allows an eligible user (e.g., based on participation/reputation) to mint their unique Insight NFT.
12. `updateInsightNFTData(uint256 _nftId, bool _wonPrediction)`: *Internal* helper to update an NFT's stats based on a prediction win/loss.
13. `updateReputationScore(address _user, bool _wonPrediction)`: *Internal* helper to update a user's reputation score.

**VI. Admin & Configuration Functions**
14. `setFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Owner sets the fee percentage.
15. `setProposerRewardPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage)`: Owner sets the proposer reward percentage.
16. `setStakingPeriodDuration(uint256 _duration)`: Owner sets the duration for staking.
17. `setResolutionPeriodDuration(uint256 _duration)`: Owner sets the duration for outcome resolution.
18. `setMinimumStakeAmount(uint256 _amount)`: Owner sets the minimum stake amount.
19. `withdrawFees()`: Owner withdraws accumulated fees.
20. `registerOutcomeResolver(address _resolver)`: Owner registers an address allowed to submit outcomes.
21. `removeOutcomeResolver(address _resolver)`: Owner removes a registered resolver.
22. `pauseContract()`: Owner can pause critical functions (using OpenZeppelin's Pausable - implicitly added via inheritance concept if needed, but let's list explicit functions first). *Self-correction: Need 20+ explicit functions. Pausable adds complexity not function count.* Let's add view functions instead.

**VII. View Functions (Adding more to reach 20+)**
23. `getEventDetails(uint256 _eventId)`: Returns comprehensive details of an event.
24. `getUserPrediction(uint256 _eventId, address _user)`: Returns a user's prediction data for an event.
25. `getInsightNFTData(uint256 _nftId)`: Returns the dynamic data for an Insight NFT.
26. `getUserInsightNFT(address _user)`: Returns the NFT ID owned by a user.
27. `getReputationScore(address _user)`: Returns a user's reputation score.
28. `getOutcomeStakedAmount(uint256 _eventId, uint256 _outcomeIndex)`: Returns the total amount staked on a specific outcome.
29. `getTotalStakedForEvent(uint256 _eventId)`: Returns the total amount staked across all outcomes for an event.
30. `getRegisteredResolvers()`: Returns the list of registered resolver addresses.

**Explanation of Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Outcome Predictor Core:** The fundamental idea of creating prediction markets on arbitrary events is a core DeFi primitive. The uniqueness here comes from the specific lifecycle (Proposed -> Approved -> Staking -> Resolving -> Resolved/Cancelled) and the role of "Resolvers" beyond just the owner.
2.  **Insight NFTs as Dynamic Reputation:** This is a key creative element. Instead of just a reputation score stored internally, it's tied to an actual ERC721 token. This NFT is *dynamic* because its underlying metadata (`totalPredictions`, `correctPredictions`, `reputation`) changes based on the user's activity *within this specific contract*. While the code shows an internal struct and an interface call (`updateNFTData`), a real implementation would need a more complex NFT contract that responds to these updates (e.g., changing traits, appearance, or metadata URI). The NFT serves as a tradable/showcasable badge of prediction skill and trustworthiness.
3.  **Reputation Score:** A simple internal score tracking wins/losses, linked to the NFT. This could be used in future versions for tiered access, voting power, or eligibility for different event types.
4.  **Multi-Role Resolution:** Allowing "Registered Resolvers" alongside the owner provides a path towards decentralized outcome submission without immediately needing a complex oracle network or on-chain voting. This allows for a more permissioned but still multi-party resolution.
5.  **Proposer Incentives:** Rewarding event proposers with a percentage of the staked amount encourages community members to actively find and propose relevant events, fueling the market.
6.  **Staking & Unstaking Mechanics:** Standard staking is included. Adding a penalty for early unstaking helps stabilize the staked amounts during the active prediction period.
7.  **Fee Structure:** Fees are collected from losing stakes. This fee pool can then be used for various purposes (protocol revenue, distribution to NFT holders, funding operations). The example `claimWinnings` distributes the *net* losing pool after fees.
8.  **Clear Event Lifecycle:** The `EventState` enum and corresponding time checks (staking start/end, resolution end) enforce a structured process, reducing ambiguity and potential manipulation.
9.  **Non-Duplication:** While prediction markets exist (Augur, Gnosis), the *specific combination* of a multi-stage approval/resolution process, dynamic prediction-linked NFTs, a reputation score tied to the NFT, proposer rewards, and the specific fee/claiming mechanics is not a standard open-source template. Each element might exist somewhere, but their integration into this single, coherent contract with 30+ functions creates a novel system.

This contract provides a robust framework for a prediction market centered around user engagement, incentivization, and on-chain identity/reputation via dynamic NFTs. Remember that for production use, aspects like handling edge cases in calculations, more robust randomness (if needed), potential oracle integration, and a more sophisticated NFT contract would be necessary.
