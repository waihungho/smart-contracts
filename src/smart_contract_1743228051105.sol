/**
 * @title Dynamic Governance DAO with On-Chain Reputation and Conditional Proposals
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - Inspired by User Request)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with advanced governance features,
 *      including on-chain reputation, conditional proposals, quadratic voting, delegated voting,
 *      dynamic fee structure, role-based access control, and more.
 *      It aims to be a creative and trendy example, avoiding direct duplication of common open-source contracts.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core DAO Functions:**
 * 1. `propose(string memory _title, string memory _description, address[] memory _targets, bytes[] memory _calldatas, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, ProposalCondition[] memory _conditions)`: Allows members to create a new proposal with conditional execution.
 * 2. `vote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _vote)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal. Implements quadratic voting.
 * 3. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal if conditions are met and voting is concluded.
 * 4. `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer or admins to cancel a proposal before voting ends.
 * 5. `delegateVote(uint256 _proposalId, address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power for a specific proposal.
 * 6. `updateQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Allows admins to update the quorum required for proposal approval.
 * 7. `updateVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Allows admins to update the default voting period.
 * 8. `setReputationThreshold(uint256 _threshold)`: Allows admins to set the minimum reputation required to create proposals.
 * 9. `setFeeOracle(address _oracle)`: Allows admins to set the address of the fee oracle contract.
 * 10. `adjustBaseFee(uint256 _newBaseFee)`: Allows admins to manually adjust the base transaction fee.
 *
 * **Reputation System Functions:**
 * 11. `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows admins to increase a member's reputation.
 * 12. `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows admins to decrease a member's reputation.
 * 13. `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Returns the reputation of a member.
 *
 * **Conditional Proposal Functions:**
 * 14. `addConditionToProposal(uint256 _proposalId, ProposalCondition _condition)`: Allows proposers to add conditions to their proposals before voting starts.
 * 15. `evaluateCondition(ProposalCondition memory _condition)` internal view returns (bool)`: Internal function to evaluate a single proposal condition.
 * 16. `areConditionsMet(uint256 _proposalId)` internal view returns (bool)`: Internal function to check if all conditions of a proposal are met.
 *
 * **Fee Management Functions:**
 * 17. `calculateTransactionFee()` public view returns (uint256)`: Calculates the dynamic transaction fee based on the fee oracle and base fee.
 * 18. `setFeeMultiplier(uint256 _multiplier)`: Allows admins to set a multiplier for the dynamic fee calculation.
 * 19. `getFeeOracle()` public view returns (address)`: Returns the address of the fee oracle contract.
 * 20. `getBaseFee()` public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the current base transaction fee.
 *
 * **Admin & Utility Functions:**
 * 21. `isAdmin(address _account)` public view returns (bool)`: Checks if an account is an admin.
 * 22. `addAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Allows admins to add new admins.
 * 23. `removeAdmin(address _adminToRemove)`: Allows admins to remove admins (excluding the contract deployer).
 * 24. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)` public view returns (ProposalState)`: Returns the current state of a proposal.
 * 25. `getProposalVoteCounts(uint256 _proposalId)` public view returns (uint256 yesVotes, uint256 noVotes, uint256 abstainVotes)`: Returns the vote counts for a proposal.
 * 26. `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool)`: Standard ERC165 interface support.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Dynamic Governance DAO with On-Chain Reputation and Conditional Proposals:** The core concept is to move beyond simple voting DAOs and introduce more sophisticated governance mechanisms.

2.  **On-Chain Reputation System:**
    *   Members have a reputation score that is tracked on-chain.
    *   Reputation can influence voting power (though simplified in this example), proposal creation rights, access to certain DAO features, etc.
    *   Admins can increase or decrease reputation, allowing for a degree of subjective quality control and rewarding positive contributions.

3.  **Conditional Proposals:**
    *   Proposals can have conditions that must be met *before* they can be executed, even if voting passes.
    *   **Condition Types:**
        *   `TIME_LOCK`: Proposal execution is delayed until a specific timestamp. This can be used for staged rollouts or to allow time for review.
        *   `EXTERNAL_CONTRACT_STATE`: Execution depends on the state of another smart contract. This allows for complex inter-contract dependencies and governance based on external events or data.  For example, a proposal might only execute if a specific price oracle reports a certain value or if another DAO has reached a certain milestone.
        *   `REPUTATION_THRESHOLD`: Execution depends on the DAO as a whole reaching a certain total reputation level. This could incentivize community building and collective contribution before major decisions are implemented.
    *   Conditions are flexible and can be extended to include more complex checks.

4.  **Quadratic Voting (Simplified):**
    *   The `vote()` function implements a simplified version of quadratic voting.
    *   Instead of linear voting power (1 token = 1 vote), voting power is scaled down (using square root in this example).
    *   This aims to mitigate the influence of whales (users with very large voting power) and give more weight to the collective votes of smaller stakeholders.  The square root is a simplification for demonstration; more sophisticated quadratic voting implementations exist.

5.  **Delegated Voting:**
    *   Members can delegate their voting power for a specific proposal to another member they trust.
    *   This allows for more efficient governance participation and expert delegation within the DAO.

6.  **Dynamic Fee Structure:**
    *   The contract integrates with a `feeOracle` contract (which is assumed to exist - you'd need to deploy one separately or use a public oracle).
    *   The `calculateTransactionFee()` function calculates a dynamic transaction fee based on:
        *   A `baseTransactionFee` (set by admins).
        *   A fee retrieved from the `feeOracle` (representing external factors like network congestion or market conditions).
        *   A `feeMultiplier` (set by admins to adjust the overall fee level).
    *   This allows the DAO to adapt transaction fees in response to changing network conditions or DAO-determined policies, potentially making the DAO more sustainable or responsive to economic factors.

7.  **Role-Based Access Control (Admin):**
    *   Uses `isAdmin` mapping and `onlyAdmin` modifier to control access to sensitive functions like updating quorum, voting periods, reputation management, and fee settings.
    *   The owner (deployer) and optionally an initial admin can be set, and admins can add/remove other admins (except the owner).

8.  **Clear Proposal Lifecycle and States:**
    *   Proposals go through states: `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `CANCELLED`, `EXECUTED`, `FAILED`.
    *   This provides a clear audit trail and management framework for proposals.

9.  **Event Emission:**
    *   Events are emitted for all important actions (proposal creation, voting, execution, cancellation, reputation changes, fee adjustments, etc.). This is crucial for off-chain monitoring and integration with user interfaces or other systems.

10. **ERC165 Interface Support:**
    *   Includes `supportsInterface()` for standard interface detection, making the contract potentially more interoperable with other protocols or tools that rely on interface identification.

**Important Notes and Potential Improvements:**

*   **Simplified Examples:**  Some parts are simplified for clarity and demonstration purposes (e.g., quadratic voting implementation, reputation-based voting power, condition evaluation, fee oracle integration). A production-ready DAO would require more robust and potentially more complex implementations of these features.
*   **Security Audits:** This is example code and has not been audited for security vulnerabilities. A real-world DAO smart contract *must* undergo thorough security audits before deployment.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Gas optimization is considered but not heavily emphasized in this example for readability. In a real-world deployment, gas optimization would be a crucial factor.
*   **Member Management:** The member concept is simplified (any address with reputation > 0 is a member). A real DAO would likely have a more explicit member registration or token-based membership system.
*   **Fee Oracle Implementation:** The `feeOracle` is assumed. You would need to deploy or integrate with an actual fee oracle contract.
*   **Condition Data Encoding:** The `ProposalCondition.data` field uses `bytes` for flexibility, but you need to carefully encode and decode data based on the `ConditionType`.  More robust data handling and validation might be needed.
*   **Upgradeability:**  For a real DAO, consider using proxy patterns for contract upgradeability to allow for future improvements and bug fixes without redeploying the entire DAO.
*   **Token Integration:**  This example doesn't explicitly use a governance token. A typical DAO would be governed by a token, and voting power would often be tied to token holdings. You could easily integrate a standard ERC20 token into this contract to make it a token-governed DAO.

This smart contract aims to showcase a range of advanced and creative features that can be incorporated into a DAO. You can adapt and expand upon these concepts to build even more sophisticated and customized decentralized governance systems.
