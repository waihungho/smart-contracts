/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Art Gallery - Smart Contract Outline and Function Summary
 * @author Gemini (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a dynamic art gallery where artworks can evolve, be curated into exhibitions,
 *      and governed by a community. This contract explores advanced concepts like dynamic NFTs,
 *      community governance, and on-chain evolution logic.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Data Structures:** Define structs for Artworks, Exhibitions, Proposals, and potentially User profiles.
 * 2. **Events:**  Emit events for all significant actions (minting, evolution, voting, curation, etc.) for off-chain monitoring.
 * 3. **Modifiers:** Implement modifiers for access control (onlyArtist, onlyCurator, onlyGalleryOwner, etc.).
 * 4. **Artist Functions:** Functions related to artwork creation and management.
 * 5. **Curator Functions:** Functions for managing exhibitions and artwork curation.
 * 6. **Community Governance Functions:** Functions for proposals, voting, and community-driven changes.
 * 7. **Dynamic Evolution Functions:** Functions that implement the logic for artwork evolution based on various factors.
 * 8. **Gallery Management Functions (Admin/Owner):** Functions for contract administration and settings.
 * 9. **View/Utility Functions:** Functions to query and retrieve information from the contract.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Artist Functions:**
 *  1. `mintArtwork(string _metadataURI, bytes _initialState)`: Allows artists to mint new artworks with metadata and initial state.
 *  2. `updateArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string _newMetadataURI)`: Artists can update the metadata URI of their artworks.
 *  3. `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Artists can transfer ownership of their artworks.
 *  4. `burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artists to burn their artworks, removing them from circulation.
 *
 * **Curator Functions:**
 *  5. `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _exhibitionDescription)`: Allows curators to create new exhibitions.
 *  6. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators can add artworks to specific exhibitions.
 *  7. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Curators can remove artworks from exhibitions.
 *  8. `setExhibitionTheme(uint256 _exhibitionId, string _newTheme)`: Curators can set or update the theme of an exhibition.
 *  9. `closeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Curators can close an exhibition, potentially triggering actions like rewards or archiving.
 *
 * **Community Governance Functions:**
 * 10. `proposeEvolution(uint256 _artworkId, bytes _evolutionData)`: Community members can propose evolutions for artworks.
 * 11. `voteOnEvolutionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Community members can vote on active evolution proposals.
 * 12. `executeEvolution(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful evolution proposal, changing the artwork's state.
 * 13. `proposeCurator(address _newCurator)`: Community members can propose new curators.
 * 14. `voteOnCuratorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Community members can vote on curator proposals.
 * 15. `revokeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`:  (Governance/Admin function) Revoke curator status.
 *
 * **Dynamic Evolution Functions:**
 * 16. `triggerAutomatedEvolution(uint256 _artworkId)`:  (Internal/Automated) Triggers an automated evolution based on predefined rules (e.g., time-based, market conditions).
 * 17. `applyEvolutionLogic(uint256 _artworkId, bytes _evolutionData)`: (Internal)  Applies the evolution logic to an artwork based on provided data. This could be complex and customizable.
 * 18. `setEvolutionAlgorithm(uint256 _artworkId, bytes _algorithmCode)`: (Governance/Artist controlled)  Potentially allows setting a custom evolution algorithm for artworks (advanced & risky).
 *
 * **Gallery Management Functions:**
 * 19. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`:  Admin function to set the gallery's commission fee on artwork sales (if implemented).
 * 20. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Admin function to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 * 21. `pauseContract()`:  Admin function to pause certain functionalities of the contract in case of emergency.
 * 22. `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to resume contract functionalities.
 * 23. `setBaseURI(string _newBaseURI)`: Admin function to set the base URI for metadata retrieval.
 *
 * **View/Utility Functions:**
 * 24. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 25. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details about a specific exhibition.
 * 26. `getArtworkExhibitions(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns a list of exhibitions an artwork is part of.
 * 27. `getCuratorExhibitions(address _curatorAddress)`: Returns a list of exhibitions managed by a curator.
 * 28. `getEvolutionProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Returns the status of an evolution proposal.
 * 29. `getGalleryFee()`: Returns the current gallery fee percentage.
 * 30. `isCurator(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a curator.
