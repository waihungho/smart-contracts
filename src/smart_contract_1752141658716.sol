Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract named `QuantumVault` that explores several advanced and creative concepts, including state management based on time, conditions, delegation, probabilistic simulation, and simulated "quantum" effects like decay and entanglement.

This contract is designed for demonstration and exploring complex ideas. It's *not* audited and might not be suitable for production environments without significant review and testing.

### **Smart Contract: QuantumVault**

**Outline & Function Summary:**

*   **Contract Name:** `QuantumVault`
*   **Purpose:** A complex vault designed to hold Ether and manage user-specific "quantum states" based on various conditions, time locks, delegation, and simulated probabilistic/entanglement principles. It allows for advanced conditional execution and future action scheduling.
*   **Key Concepts Explored:**
    *   Simulated "Quantum State" per user (`bytes32`).
    *   Time-based state locking and validation.
    *   Conditional state transitions based on current state.
    *   Delegated control over other users' states.
    *   Storing conditions for future execution (`FutureAction`).
    *   Simulated probabilistic outcomes (using block data - *note: not cryptographically secure VRF*).
    *   Simulated "Entanglement" between user states.
    *   Simulated "Quantum State Decay" over time.
    *   Basic Pausability and Ownership.

*   **Functions:**

    1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
    2.  `receive()`: Allows receiving Ether deposits into the vault.
    3.  `deposit()`: Explicit function to receive Ether (alternative to `receive`).
    4.  `withdrawOwner(uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw Ether from the vault (standard).
    5.  `setQuantumState(address user, bytes32 newState)`: Allows owner or delegatee to set a specific quantum state for a user (requires state not being locked).
    6.  `getQuantumState(address user)`: Retrieves the current quantum state of a user.
    7.  `lockStateForTime(address user, uint256 duration)`: Locks a user's state from being changed until `block.timestamp + duration`.
    8.  `checkStateLock(address user)`: Returns the timestamp when a user's state lock expires (0 if not locked).
    9.  `setTimeSensitiveState(address user, bytes32 state, uint256 validUntil)`: Sets a state for a user that is only considered "valid" until a specific timestamp.
    10. `isTimeSensitiveStateValid(address user)`: Checks if the user's currently set time-sensitive state is still valid based on its expiry time.
    11. `conditionalStateTransition(address user, bytes32 requiredState, bytes32 newState)`: Changes a user's state to `newState` ONLY if their current state is `requiredState` (and state is not locked).
    12. `multiStateCheck(address[] users, bytes32[] requiredStates)`: Checks if all specified users are simultaneously in their corresponding required states.
    13. `delegateStateControl(address delegatee, address user)`: Allows owner to delegate the right to set/manage a specific user's state to another address.
    14. `revokeStateControl(address delegatee, address user)`: Allows owner to revoke previously delegated state control.
    15. `canControlState(address delegatee, address user)`: Checks if an address has been delegated control over a user's state.
    16. `futureConditionalAction(uint256 timestamp, address targetUser, bytes32 requiredState, bytes data)`: Stores a future action (arbitrary `bytes data`) to be potentially executed by anyone, provided the target user is in `requiredState` at the specified `timestamp` or later.
    17. `triggerFutureAction(uint256 actionId)`: Attempts to trigger a stored future action. Checks time and state condition before executing the stored `bytes data` using a low-level `call`.
    18. `cancelFutureAction(uint256 actionId)`: Allows the owner or original action scheduler to cancel a pending future action.
    19. `getFutureActionDetails(uint256 actionId)`: Retrieves the details of a stored future action.
    20. `probabilisticUnlockAttempt(address user, uint256 entropyHint)`: Simulates a probabilistic attempt to "unlock" something (represented here by changing a state). The success probability is influenced by contract state, block data, user, and the provided `entropyHint`. Returns success status. (*Crucially, this is a simulation and not a secure VRF.*)
    21. `setEntanglementState(address userA, address userB, bytes32 linkedState)`: Records a conceptual "entanglement" between two users, linked by a shared state. Does not enforce actual state synchronization, merely records the link.
    22. `checkEntanglement(address userA, address userB)`: Returns the linked state if two users are recorded as entangled, and whether they are entangled.
    23. `executeIfEntangled(address userA, address userB, bytes data)`: Executes arbitrary `bytes data` using `call` ONLY IF the two users are currently recorded as entangled.
    24. `decayQuantumState(address user, bytes32 initialState, uint256 initialTimestamp, uint256 decayRate)`: Records initial parameters for a user's state that is subject to conceptual decay.
    25. `getDecayedState(address user)`: *Calculates* a conceptual decayed state based on the recorded initial state, timestamp, and decay rate and the current time. The state itself isn't changed, this is a calculation/query function.
    26. `getContractBalance()`: Returns the current Ether balance of the contract.
    27. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership (standard).
    28. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces ownership (standard).
    29. `pause()`: Pauses the contract, preventing sensitive state-changing actions (standard).
    30. `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract (standard).

        // E.g., a 'strength' or 'probability factor' associated with using that state.
        // Since we can't return that easily here as bytes32, let's return a hash that
        // incorporates the initial state and the decay amount. This gives a unique bytes32
        // that represents the state *at this moment in time* due to decay.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Simulated Quantum State (`bytes32 quantumStates`):**
    *   Instead of just owning tokens or having a boolean flag, each user has a `bytes32` value representing their unique "quantum state". This state can be set, queried, and acts as a precondition for many operations. `bytes32` is flexible; it could represent a hash, an ID, or packed parameters depending on how the contract is used.
2.  **Time-Sensitive States and State Locks:**
    *   `lockStateForTime`: Prevents the `quantumState` from being changed until a future timestamp. This is a form of state control based on time.
    *   `setTimeSensitiveState`: Sets a *secondary* state that is only considered valid within a specific time window. This adds another layer of time-based conditionality beyond simple locks. `isTimeSensitiveStateValid` allows checking this condition.
3.  **Conditional State Transitions (`conditionalStateTransition`):**
    *   Implements a basic state machine pattern. A state can only be changed to `newState` if it is currently `requiredState`. This enforces specific paths or prerequisites for state changes.
4.  **Delegated State Control (`delegateStateControl`, `revokeStateControl`):**
    *   Allows the owner to grant specific addresses the power to manage the state of *other* users. This is more granular than simply transferring ownership and introduces a form of permission delegation.
5.  **Future Conditional Actions (`futureConditionalAction`, `triggerFutureAction`, `cancelFutureAction`):**
    *   This is a powerful pattern. The contract stores a set of instructions (`bytes data`) and conditions (timestamp, required state). *Anyone* can call `triggerFutureAction`, but it will only execute the stored data via a low-level `call` *if* the time has passed AND the target user's state meets the requirement. This offloads the triggering mechanism but keeps the conditionality on-chain. It requires careful handling of the `bytes data` to avoid security vulnerabilities depending on what it calls. Here, it's primarily designed to call back into `address(this)`.
6.  **Simulated Probabilistic Outcome (`probabilisticUnlockAttempt`):**
    *   Demonstrates how to *simulate* a probabilistic event on-chain using pseudo-randomness sources (block data, timestamp, user address, entropy hint). It's crucial to understand (and the code comments note) that this is NOT a secure Verifiable Random Function (VRF) suitable for high-value applications where outcomes must be unbiasable. It shows a *conceptual* probabilistic element tied to state change.
7.  **Simulated Entanglement (`setEntanglementState`, `checkEntanglement`, `executeIfEntangled`):**
    *   Introduces a concept where two users' states can be linked. While the contract doesn't automatically synchronize their states, it records this link (`entanglements` mapping) and allows an action (`executeIfEntangled`) to occur *only if* this linked relationship exists. This simulates a dependent, coupled state where actions require the presence of a specific link.
8.  **Simulated Quantum State Decay (`decayQuantumState`, `getDecayedState`):**
    *   This is an abstract simulation. The actual `bytes32` state doesn't change over time automatically. Instead, the contract stores parameters defining how the state *would* decay conceptually (initial state, time set, decay rate). The `getDecayedState` function calculates a *conceptual* state value *at the moment of query* based on elapsed time and the decay rate. This shows how contract state can represent dynamic values that change conceptually based on time, even if the underlying storage isn't updated continuously.

This contract provides a playground for complex state interactions and conditional logic that goes beyond typical token or simple utility contracts.
