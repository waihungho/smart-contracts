Okay, let's design an interesting, advanced, and creative smart contract that combines elements of decentralized prediction/oracle markets, reputation systems, and staking, without directly copying existing protocols like Augur, Gnosis, etc., by adding unique mechanics focused on 'Knowledge Claims' and on-chain reputation.

We'll call it the "Sybil's Oracle Protocol" (a bit of a tongue-in-cheek name, implying it tries to find truth even in a potentially Sybil-prone environment). Users stake tokens on "knowledge claims" about future events or data points. An authorized oracle (or eventually a DAO) resolves these claims. Successful stakers (both the claimant and validators who staked correctly) earn reputation and rewards from the losing side's stakes.

This requires managing claims, stakes, resolution, rewards, fees, reputation, and access control for oracles and administrators. We'll use OpenZeppelin contracts for standard features like Access Control and Pausability.

**Sybil's Oracle Protocol: Outline and Function Summary**

**Concept:**
A decentralized protocol where users can propose "knowledge claims" about future events or data points by staking a designated ERC-20 token. Other users can stake tokens supporting or opposing the claim. An authorized oracle resolves the claim after a set time. Stakers on the correct side share rewards from the incorrect side's stakes, minus a protocol fee. Users earn on-chain reputation based on successful stakes.

**Key Components:**
*   **Staking Token:** An ERC-20 token used for all staking activities.
*   **Claims:** Structured data representing a knowledge claim, its resolution time, staked amounts, and status.
*   **Stakes:** Users commit tokens to support or oppose a claim.
*   **Oracle:** An authorized entity (or role) responsible for resolving claims based on external reality.
*   **Reputation:** An on-chain score reflecting a user's history of successful predictions/stakes.
*   **Protocol Fees:** A percentage of losing stakes collected by the protocol treasury.
*   **Access Control:** Roles for Admins (governance) and Oracles.
*   **Pausability:** Emergency pause functionality.

**Roles:**
*   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can manage Oracle and Pauser roles, set protocol parameters, withdraw fees.
*   `ORACLE_ROLE`: Can resolve claims.
*   `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause and unpause the contract.

**State Variables:**
*   `stakingToken`: Address of the ERC-20 token.
*   `nextClaimId`: Counter for new claims.
*   `claims`: Mapping from claim ID to `Claim` struct.
*   `userReputation`: Mapping from user address to reputation score.
*   `protocolFeeBasisPoints`: Fee percentage (e.g., 100 = 1%).
*   `minStakeAmount`: Minimum token amount required for any stake.
*   `totalStakedTokens`: Total tokens locked in the contract.
*   `totalProtocolFees`: Total fees collected.

**Structs:**
*   `Claim`: Stores claim details, stakes for/against, resolution info, and per-user stake mappings.

**Enums:**
*   `ClaimStatus`: Represents the state of a claim (Open, ResolvedTrue, ResolvedFalse, Cancelled).

**Events:**
*   `ClaimCreated`: Logs new claim details.
*   `Staked`: Logs when a user stakes on a claim.
*   `ClaimResolved`: Logs claim outcome and resolution time.
*   `RewardsClaimed`: Logs when a user claims rewards/principal.
*   `ClaimCancelled`: Logs when a claim is cancelled.
*   `ReputationUpdated`: Logs reputation changes.
*   `ProtocolFeeSet`: Logs change in fee percentage.
*   `MinStakeAmountSet`: Logs change in minimum stake.
*   `FeesWithdrawn`: Logs withdrawal of protocol fees.

**Function Summary (25 functions):**

1.  `constructor(address initialStakingToken, uint256 initialMinStake, uint256 initialFeeBasisPoints)`: Initializes the contract, roles, token, minimum stake, and fee.
2.  `createClaim(string memory claimText, uint256 resolutionTime, uint256 initialStakeAmount)`: Allows a user to propose a new claim, staking tokens for it.

4.  `stakeAgainstClaim(uint256 claimId, uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to stake tokens opposing an existing claim.
5.  `resolveClaim(uint256 claimId, bool isClaimTrue)`: (ORACLE_ROLE) Resolves a claim after its resolution time, setting the outcome.
6.  `claimRewardsOrPrincipal(uint256 claimId)`: Allows a user to claim their principal and/or rewards after a claim is resolved.
7.  `cancelClaim(uint256 claimId)`: Allows the original claimant to cancel an unresolved claim under specific conditions (e.g., no opposing stakes yet).

17. `getClaimStatus(uint256 claimId)`: View function to get the current status of a claim (enum).
18. `getClaimStakesTotal(uint256 claimId)`: View function returning total stakes for and against a claim.
19. `getTotalStaked()`: View function returning the total amount of staking tokens held by the contract.
20. `addOracle(address oracle)`: (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) Grants ORACLE_ROLE to an address.
21. `removeOracle(address oracle)`: (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) Revokes ORACLE_ROLE from an address.

24. `withdrawProtocolFees(address recipient)`: (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) Withdraws accumulated protocol fees to a specified address.
25. `pause()`: (PAUSER_ROLE) Pauses contract functionality.
26. `unpause()`: (PAUSER_ROLE) Unpauses contract functionality.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Uniqueness:**

1.  **Combined Mechanics:** It's not just staking or prediction; it explicitly links staking outcomes to an on-chain `Reputation` score. While simple here (just incrementing), this can be expanded into more complex reputation systems (decay, weighted by stake/time, linked to off-chain identity proofs, etc.).
2.  **Oracle Dependency & Access Control:** Uses the `ORACLE_ROLE` pattern for off-chain data input, standard in DeFi but implemented here specifically for prediction resolution. The `AccessControl` allows decentralized governance or a multisig to manage who holds this powerful role.
3.  **Winner-Takes-Loser's-Pool:** The reward mechanism is a common prediction market pattern, but combined with the reputation system, it reinforces accurate predictions. The protocol fee ensures sustainability for potential future treasury/governance use.
4.  **`claimRewardsOrPrincipal` Pattern:** Instead of automatically pushing rewards in `resolveClaim` (which can hit gas limits with many stakers), users pull their funds and trigger the reputation update themselves. This is a standard gas-saving pattern.
5.  **`cancelClaim` with Condition:** Allowing the claimant to cancel only if no opposing stakes exist prevents griefing (claiming trivial things and cancelling) while allowing correction of mistakes if nobody has interacted yet.
6.  **Basis Points for Fees:** Using basis points (`1/100th of a percent`) is standard practice in financial protocols for precision.
7.  **OpenZeppelin Best Practices:** Incorporates `AccessControl`, `Pausable`, and `ReentrancyGuard` for robust security and common management patterns, which are cornerstones of modern Solidity development.
8.  **Clarity via Enums and Structs:** Using an `enum` for `ClaimStatus` and a detailed `struct` for `Claim` makes the state transitions and data representation clear and less error-prone than using magic numbers or separate variables.

This contract provides a framework for a decentralized knowledge-sharing or prediction game layer, with built-in incentives for accuracy (rewards + reputation) and penalties for inaccuracy (loss of stake). It's a foundation that could be extended with more sophisticated reputation mechanics, different resolution mechanisms (e.g., weighted voting by reputation, integrating decentralized oracles like Chainlink, or even zk-proof based verification for certain claim types), or integration with other DeFi primitives.
