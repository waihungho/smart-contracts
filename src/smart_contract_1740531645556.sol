/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous News Aggregator & Curator (DANAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Language Model)
 * @notice This smart contract implements a decentralized news aggregator and curator.
 * It allows users to submit news article links, stake tokens to vote on the credibility
 * and relevance of these articles, and rewards curators who identify high-quality,
 * impactful news.  It uses quadratic voting principles to mitigate whale manipulation.
 * It also features a reputation system for curators.
 *
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * 1.  **Submission:** Users submit news articles with a link and a brief description.
 * 2.  **Staking/Voting:** Users stake tokens on news articles to vote on their credibility and relevance. Quadratic voting is used.
 * 3.  **Curator Rewards:** Curators are rewarded for identifying high-quality articles based on the accumulated stake.
 * 4.  **Reputation System:** Curators gain reputation based on the performance of their selected articles.
 * 5.  **Governance (Future):**  Potentially integrate governance to modify parameters such as staking rewards and minimum stake requirements.
 *
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 *  *   `constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _submissionFee, uint256 _stakingRewardPercentage, uint256 _minStakeAmount)`:  Initializes the contract.
 *  *   `submitArticle(string memory _articleLink, string memory _description)`: Allows users to submit a news article link and description.
 *  *   `stakeOnArticle(uint256 _articleId, uint256 _stakeAmount)`: Allows users to stake tokens on a specific article.  Implements quadratic voting.
 *  *   `unstakeFromArticle(uint256 _articleId, uint256 _stakeAmount)`: Allows users to unstake tokens from a specific article. Tokens are returned to the user.
 *  *   `claimCurationReward(uint256 _articleId)`: Allows curators to claim a reward for identifying high-quality articles.
 *  *   `getArticleDetails(uint256 _articleId)`: Returns details about a specific article, including link, description, total stake, and submitter.
 *  *   `getUserStake(uint256 _articleId, address _user)`: Returns the amount of tokens a specific user has staked on an article.
 *  *   `getCurationReward(uint256 _articleId)`: Calculates the curation reward based on total stake.
 *  *   `getCuratorReputation(address _curator)`: Returns the reputation score of a specific curator.
 *  *   `setSubmissionFee(uint256 _newSubmissionFee)`: Allows the owner to set the submission fee.
 *  *   `setStakingRewardPercentage(uint256 _newStakingRewardPercentage)`: Allows the owner to set the staking reward percentage.
 *  *   `setMinimumStakeAmount(uint256 _newMinimumStakeAmount)`:  Allows the owner to set the minimum stake amount.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Quadratic Voting:**  Crucially, the `stakeOnArticle` and `unstakeFromArticle` functions now *correctly* implement quadratic voting.  This is done by calculating the *cost* (and refund) to add (or remove) a certain stake, based on the square root relationship.  This makes it much harder for a single large holder ("whale") to dominate the voting, as the cost increases quadratically.  The stake itself remains the original tokens spent.  The `sqrt()` function is included for this calculation (adapted from Solidity by Example).
* **IERC20 Interface:** Correctly defines and uses the ERC20 interface for token interactions.  Critically includes `approve` and `allowance` which are sometimes required for `transferFrom` to work.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to prevent common errors, such as staking on an invalid article, transferring insufficient funds, or claiming a reward multiple times.  Clear error messages are provided.
* **Gas Optimization:** Some minor gas optimization is incorporated, although further optimizations are possible depending on the specific use case.
* **Events:**  Events are emitted for all significant actions (article submission, staking, unstaking, reward claiming) to provide a clear audit trail on the blockchain.
* **Clear Function Modifiers:** The `onlyOwner` modifier is used to restrict access to sensitive functions.
* **Curation Reward Calculation:** The `getCurationReward` function calculates the reward based on the total stake and the configured percentage.
* **Reputation System:** A rudimentary reputation system is included, where curators gain reputation points for claiming rewards.  This could be expanded with more sophisticated metrics (e.g., weighted by the amount of stake, or decaying over time).
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:** The current implementation *should* be relatively safe from re-entrancy attacks due to the order of operations (updating state before transferring tokens). However, thorough auditing is essential before deploying to a production environment. Using the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern as a general rule helps mitigate this risk.  A more robust solution could use re-entrancy guards from the `OpenZeppelin` library.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later versions have built-in overflow/underflow protection.
    * **Front Running:**  Less of an immediate risk, but consider potential front-running vulnerabilities.  For example, someone could see a pending `claimCurationReward` transaction and try to front-run it.  Mitigation could involve commit-reveal schemes or using a more decentralized oracle for reward calculation.
* **Governance (Future):** The "Outline" mentions potential governance to control contract parameters.  This could be implemented using a separate governance token and voting mechanism.
* **Receive Function:** Added a `receive()` function to allow the contract to receive Ether.  This is primarily for future extensibility or as a fallback.  However, be extremely careful if you intend to use Ether within the contract, as it opens up new security considerations.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ganache, Rinkeby, Mainnet).  You'll need to provide the address of the ERC20 token you want to use for staking and rewards.
2.  **Approve:** Users need to *approve* the contract to spend their tokens using the ERC20 `approve` function.  For example, a user might call `token.approve(address(DANAC), uint256.max);` to allow the contract to spend any amount of their tokens.
3.  **Submit Articles:** Users can call `submitArticle` to submit news articles (paying the submission fee).
4.  **Stake/Unstake:** Users can call `stakeOnArticle` and `unstakeFromArticle` to stake or unstake tokens on articles they believe are credible and relevant.
5.  **Claim Rewards:** Curators (anyone) can call `claimCurationReward` on articles with significant stake to claim a reward.
6.  **Owner Functions:** The owner can adjust parameters like the submission fee and staking reward percentage.

This is a significantly improved and more complete implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous News Aggregator.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit this code before deploying it to a production environment.
