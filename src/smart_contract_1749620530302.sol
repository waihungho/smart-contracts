Okay, let's design a smart contract focused on decentralized, collaborative creative content creation, governance, and licensing under principles similar to Creative Commons, managed by a DAO with its own token and unique NFTs representing the final works.

This concept combines:
1.  **Collaborative Input:** Users contribute raw creative "snippets".
2.  **DAO Governance:** A token-weighted DAO decides how to combine snippets, mint final works, set licenses, and manage revenue.
3.  **Dynamic / Licensed NFTs:** Final works are minted as NFTs with on-chain references to licenses and revenue-sharing terms.
4.  **On-Chain Licensing:** A registry of accepted licenses, linked to NFTs.
5.  **Revenue Sharing:** Automated distribution of revenue generated from NFTs.

Let's call this contract `DecentralizedAutonomousCreativeCommons (DACC)`.

/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Creative Commons (DACC)
 * @dev A smart contract platform for decentralized, collaborative content creation,
 *      governance via a DAO, and managing on-chain licenses and revenue sharing
 *      for creative works represented as NFTs.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Variables: Track internal counters, addresses of linked contracts (DAO token, NFT),
 *    mappings for snippets, works, proposals, licenses, and core DAO parameters.
 * 2. Structs: Define data structures for Snippets, Works, Proposals, and Licenses.
 * 3. Enums: Define types for Snippets and Proposals.
 * 4. Events: Announce key state changes (contribution, proposal, vote, execution, mint, etc.).
 * 5. Modifiers: Custom modifiers for access control and state checks.
 * 6. Core Logic:
 *    - Constructor/Initialization: Set initial parameters and trusted addresses.
 *    - License Management: Add and retrieve supported Creative Commons-like licenses.
 *    - Snippet Contribution: Allow users to contribute creative fragments.
 *    - DAO Proposals: Allow token holders to propose actions (work creation, license changes, etc.).
 *    - Voting: Allow token/NFT holders to vote on proposals (token-weighted + potential NFT boosts).
 *    - Proposal Execution: Execute successful proposals (minting works, applying changes).
 *    - Work & NFT Management: Link works to NFTs, manage metadata hashes, and revenue sharing.
 *    - Revenue Sharing: Implement a mechanism for distributing revenue.
 *    - Delegation: Allow token holders to delegate voting power (standard DAO pattern).
 *    - Views: Functions to query the state of snippets, works, proposals, etc.
 * 7. External Contract Interaction: Interface with separate ERC20 (governance token) and ERC721 (work NFT) contracts.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - Core Setup/Admin (5 functions): initialize, setDaccToken, setWorkNFT, addSupportedLicense, setDefaultLicense, transferOwnership (from Ownable pattern).
 * - Snippet Management (2 functions): contributeSnippet, deactivateSnippet.
 * - License Registry (2 functions): getLicense, getDefaultLicenseId.
 * - Work Management (2 functions): getWork, getWorkSnippetIds, getWorkContributorShares (total 3).
 * - DAO Proposals (4 functions): proposeWorkCreation, proposeLicenseChange, proposeRevenueShareChange, proposeGenericAction.
 * - Voting (3 functions): castVote, delegateVote, getVotingWeight, getDelegatee (total 4).
 * - Proposal Execution (1 function): executeProposal.
 * - Work Minting/Revenue (2 functions): mintWorkNFT (internal via executeProposal), distributeRevenue.
 * - Views/Helpers (5+ functions): getSnippet, getProposal, getLatestSnippetId, getLatestWorkId, getLatestProposalId, getLatestLicenseId, getProposalVoteCounts, getProposalState, getActiveProposals, getDAOParameters (total 10+).
 * Total: ~29+ functions (includes getters/views adding up). Exceeds the 20 function requirement.
 *
 * Advanced Concepts Used:
 * - Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for collective decision making.
 * - Token-weighted Voting with Delegation.
 * - Collaborative Content Creation Workflow (Snippet -> Proposal -> Work -> NFT).
 * - On-Chain Licensing Registry and Association with NFTs.
 * - Automated Revenue Sharing based on DAO-approved splits.
 * - Content Addressing (using metadata hashes for off-chain data like IPFS).
 * - Interaction with external ERC20 and ERC721 contracts.
 * - Proposal types for different governance actions.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects & Non-Duplication:**

1.  **Collaborative Creation Workflow (Snippet -> Work -> NFT):** This is distinct from standard NFT minting or even generative art platforms. It provides an on-chain registry of the *components* (snippets) that make up a final *work*, linking contribution directly to the final asset.
2.  **On-Chain Licensing Registry:** While licenses themselves exist off-chain, the contract maintains an explicit registry of supported licenses and links specific works (and thus their NFTs) to a particular license ID on-chain. This is more structured than just putting a license URL in NFT metadata; it allows for potential future logic based on license type (e.g., filtering based on commercial use allowed). The `isRevocable` flag adds a layer of dynamic control governed by the DAO.
3.  **Automated, DAO-Governed Revenue Sharing:** The contract defines revenue share percentages and contributor splits *at the Work level*, approved by the DAO. The `distributeRevenue` function provides a mechanism for distributing collected funds according to these DAO-defined rules. This connects the financial outcome directly back to the original contributors and the governing body.
4.  **Multi-Type Proposals:** The DAO supports distinct proposal types (`CreateWork`, `ChangeLicense`, `ChangeRevenueShare`, `GenericAction`), demonstrating a more complex governance structure than a simple yes/no vote on one type of action. The use of `bytes proposalData` allows for extensibility.
5.  **Dynamic State Transitions:** Snippets can be `isActive` or `deactivated`. Works transition from being a DAO proposal placeholder to being `isMinted`. Proposals have several distinct `ProposalState`s managed by timestamp and votes.
6.  **Separation of Concerns (Conceptual):** While all in one contract file for demonstration, the design conceptually separates the DACC Token (ERC20), Creative Work NFT (ERC721), Snippet Management, Work Definition, License Registry, and DAO Governance. In a production system, the Token and NFT would likely be separate contracts, with this contract holding their addresses and interacting via interfaces, as shown.
7.  **Non-Duplication:** While utilizing standard OpenZeppelin patterns (like `Ownable`), the core logic connecting snippet contribution, DAO voting on work composition/licensing/revenue, on-chain license linking, and automated distribution based on DAO-approved shares is not a standard, commonly available open-source template like a simple ERC-20, ERC-721, or even a basic Governor contract from OpenZeppelin. It's a synthesis of multiple concepts into a specific, creative workflow.

This contract provides a framework for a decentralized platform where a community collectively builds a library of creative content, owns the resulting assets (NFTs), governs the terms of use (licenses), and shares in the economic benefits.
