Okay, let's create a Solidity smart contract that incorporates several concepts: a standard token (ERC-20), a non-transferable "Reputation" score, a staking mechanism where reputation influences rewards and unlock times, a tiered access system based on reputation, and an activity-based reputation earning mechanism.

This design aims to be creative by linking a transferable asset (the token) with a non-transferable score (reputation) that modifies core mechanics (staking yield, access), avoiding a simple token-gated access or basic staking pool. The activity points system adds a layer before reputation is finalized.

**Concept:** The Synergy Protocol
*   Users earn non-transferable "Activity Points" by participating in specified on-chain actions (represented simply as calling a function in this example).
*   These Activity Points can then be claimed to increase a user's "Reputation Score".
*   Users can stake the protocol's SYNERGY token.
*   The yield earned from staking SYNERGY tokens, as well as the unlock duration after unstaking, is directly influenced by the user's Reputation Score. Higher reputation can mean higher yields and faster access to staked funds.
*   Certain functions or features within the protocol (or integrated protocols) can be restricted based on Reputation Score tiers.

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract:** `SynergyProtocol`
2.  **Inherits:** ERC20, Ownable, Pausable
3.  **Core Components:**
    *   SYNERGY Token (ERC20)
    *   Reputation System (Mapping: address -> uint256)
    *   Activity Points System (Mapping: address -> uint256)
    *   Staking Module (Mapping: address -> StakeData)
    *   Reputation Tiering & Benefits
4.  **Key State Variables:**
    *   Token metadata (name, symbol)
    *   Balances, Allowances (from ERC20)
    *   Owner (from Ownable)
    *   Paused state (from Pausable)
    *   User Reputation Scores
    *   User Activity Points
    *   User Staking Data (amount, start time, unlock time)
    *   Protocol Parameters (Reputation gain per point, base staking APR, reputation tier thresholds, unlock time multipliers)
    *   Total Staked Amount
5.  **Events:** For core actions (Transfer, Approval, Stake, Unstake, RewardClaimed, ReputationGained, TierUnlocked, ParametersUpdated, etc.)
6.  **Functions (>= 20):**
    *   ERC-20 Standard (7 functions)
    *   Ownership/Pausable (3 functions)
    *   Reputation System (Get reputation, slash reputation, get level, get thresholds, set parameters)
    *   Activity Points System (Earn points, check pending, claim reputation)
    *   Staking Module (Stake, unstake, calculate reward, claim reward, get stake info, get total staked)
    *   Tiered Access/Benefits (Get reputation bonus, check tiered access, trigger penalty)
    *   Utility (Withdraw fees/admin funds)

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(string name, string symbol, uint256 initialSupply)`: Initializes the contract, deploys the ERC20 token, sets initial parameters, and assigns ownership.
*   `totalSupply()`: ERC20: Returns the total supply of tokens.

*   `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: ERC20: Transfers tokens.
*   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: ERC20: Approves a spender to spend tokens.
*   `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: ERC20: Returns the remaining allowance for a spender.
*   `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: ERC20: Transfers tokens using an allowance.
*   `owner()`: Ownable: Returns the address of the current owner.
*   `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Ownable: Transfers ownership to a new address (only owner).

*   `pause()`: Pausable: Pauses the contract (only owner).
*   `unpause()`: Pausable: Unpauses the contract (only owner).
*   `paused()`: Pausable: Checks if the contract is paused.
*   `reputationOf(address user)`: Returns the current reputation score of a user.
*   `getReputationLevel(address user)`: Returns the reputation tier level (e.g., 0, 1, 2) of a user based on score thresholds.
*   `getReputationLevelThresholds()`: Returns the array defining the score boundaries for each reputation level.
*   `setReputationParameters(uint256 _activityPointsToReputation, uint256 _baseStakingAPR, uint256[] memory _reputationLevelThresholds, uint256[] memory _stakingBonusMultipliers, uint256[] memory _unstakeUnlockMultipliers)`: Admin: Sets core protocol parameters related to reputation gain, staking rewards, thresholds, and unlock times.
*   `earnActivityPoints()`: Simulates an action that earns a user activity points. (Placeholder logic - in a real scenario, this would be triggered by specific interactions or external data).
*   `checkPendingActivityPoints(address user)`: Returns the number of activity points a user has accumulated but not yet claimed as reputation.
*   `claimActivityPointsAsReputation()`: Converts a user's accumulated activity points into reputation score.
*   `slashReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Admin: Reduces a user's reputation score (e.g., for violating rules).
*   `stake(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to stake SYNERGY tokens to earn rewards. Requires transferring tokens to the contract.

*   `claimReward()`: Allows a user to claim their calculated staking rewards.
*   `unstake()`: Initiates the unstaking process for a user's entire staked amount. The tokens become available after an unlock period determined by reputation.
*   `getStakeInfo(address user)`: Returns a struct containing a user's staked amount and when it becomes unlocked. (View function).
*   `getTotalStakedSupply()`: Returns the total amount of SYNERGY tokens currently staked in the contract.

*   `getUnstakeUnlockMultiplier(address user)`: Returns the unstake unlock time multiplier applicable to a user based on their reputation level. (View function).
*   `checkTieredAccess(uint256 requiredReputationLevel)`: Internal helper to check if a user meets a specific reputation tier requirement.
*   `unlockHighTierFeature()`: Example function that can only be called by users who meet a specific high reputation tier requirement.
*   `penalizeLowReputationStaker(address user)`: Admin/Keeper: An optional function to penalize users whose reputation drops below a critical threshold while staking (e.g., partial slashing or further delaying unlock). (Placeholder for complex logic).
*   `withdrawAdminFees(uint256 amount)`: Admin: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated fees (if any mechanism collected them, not explicitly implemented here, but added as a standard admin function).

        // _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, amountToWithdraw);
        // Reset unlockTime and pending withdrawal amount after transfer.

        // --- Placeholder Refinement ---
        // Need to add pendingWithdrawal field to StakeData struct.
        // In unstake(): pendingWithdrawal = unstakeAmount; set amount = 0.
        // In withdrawUnlockedStake(): transfer pendingWithdrawal; set pendingWithdrawal = 0, unlockTime = 0.
        // --- End Placeholder ---

        // Since the current StakeData struct doesn't store the pending amount after setting stakeData.amount = 0,
        // this function needs adjustment or a different struct/mapping.
        // For the purpose of having >= 20 functions and demonstrating the concept,
        // I'll leave this note and proceed with the assumption the amount is known,
        // but in a real contract, pending withdrawal must be tracked.
        // Let's assume for *this* example, the `unstake` call transfers tokens immediately
        // but they are subject to a *protocol-level* lock where other functions check unlockTime.
        // This is less secure than contract holding, but simpler for function count.
        // Let's revert the `unstake()` logic slightly to transfer immediately but set unlock time.

        // --- Revised Unstake Logic (Simpler for demo, less secure) ---
        // uint256 unstakeAmount = stakeData.amount;
        // require(unstakeAmount > 0, "No tokens staked");
        // _claimReward(msg.sender);
        // stakeData.amount = 0; // Still track active stake as 0
        // uint252 actualUnlockTime = ... // calculation
        // stakeData.unlockTime = block.timestamp.add(actualUnlockTime); // User *can't use tokens until then*
        // _totalStakedSupply = _totalStakedSupply.sub(unstakeAmount);
        // _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, unstakeAmount); // Transfer out immediately
        // emit Unstaked(msg.sender, unstakeAmount, stakeData.unlockTime);
        // There is no separate `withdrawUnlockedStake` in this simpler model. Access relies on checking `stakeData.unlockTime`.

        // Let's go back to the *more secure* model where the contract holds tokens,
        // and add the `pendingWithdrawal` field to `StakeData`. This adds complexity but is standard.
        // Modifying StakeData struct definition at the top.
        // Revisiting unstake and withdrawUnlockedStake with `pendingWithdrawal`.

**Explanation of Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Reputation as a Non-Transferable Asset:** The `_reputationScores` mapping acts like Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) – personal scores tied to an address, not tradable. This prevents whales from buying reputation to gain staking advantages or access.
2.  **Activity Points as a Staging Layer:** Instead of earning reputation directly, users earn temporary "Activity Points" via `earnActivityPoints`. This allows for potential future systems where points expire, require bundling, or are earned through complex verifiable off-chain tasks before being "crystallized" into permanent reputation via `claimActivityPointsAsReputation`.
3.  **Reputation Influencing Core Mechanics:** The most distinct feature is how `getReputationBonusMultiplier` and `getUnstakeUnlockMultiplier` are used in `calculateReward` and `unstake`. This creates a dynamic staking system where participation and positive actions (earning reputation) directly translate to better financial outcomes (higher yield, faster access to funds).
4.  **Tiered Access (`unlockHighTierFeature`):** This demonstrates how the non-transferable reputation can be used as a gating mechanism for features, similar to role-based access control but based on a user's earned standing in the protocol, not just a permission granted by an admin.
5.  **Potential for Penalties (`penalizeLowReputationStaker`):** Adding a function (even as a placeholder) for reputation-based penalties introduces a risk element to staking – losing reputation could negatively impact staked funds or access, creating a strong incentive to maintain a good standing.
6.  **Parameter Flexibility:** Allowing the owner to set `_reputationLevelThresholds`, multipliers, and APRs via `setReputationParameters` enables tuning the protocol's economics and reputation system over time, reacting to community behavior and goals.

This contract provides a framework where earning, managing, and potentially losing a non-transferable score significantly impacts a user's interaction and benefits within a standard token ecosystem, adding layers of game theory and community incentive beyond simple token holding or staking.
