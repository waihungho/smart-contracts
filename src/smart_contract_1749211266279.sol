Okay, let's design a smart contract called `ChronoVault`. This vault will manage deposited funds with complex, dynamic unlock conditions attached to different "tranches" (segments) of the funds. The conditions can be time-based, dependent on internal contract state, or even simulated external interactions. It will also include concepts like state checkpoints and guardian overrides.

This goes beyond typical timelocks by allowing *multiple* conditions per tranche, different *types* of conditions, linking unlocks to internal contract state, and incorporating a simulated interaction check concept.

**Smart Contract: ChronoVault**

**Outline:**

1.  **Purpose:** A non-standard vault contract that holds ETH/tokens and releases them based on dynamic, multi-faceted conditions attached to specific "tranches" of funds.
2.  **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Tranches:** Segments of deposited funds, each with its own set of unlock conditions.
    *   **Dynamic Conditions:** Conditions are not just fixed timestamps but can be time-elapsed, dependent on the contract's internal state (tracked by a counter), or verified via simulated external interaction outcomes.
    *   **State Checkpoints:** Ability to record snapshots of key internal state at specific times.
    *   **Guardians:** Addresses with special emergency powers.
    *   **Vault State:** An overall state indicating the general unlock status.
3.  **Interfaces:** Requires `IERC20` for token handling.
4.  **Enums:** `VaultState`, `ConditionType`.
5.  **Structs:** `Condition`, `Tranche`.
6.  **State Variables:** Store owner, guardians, tranches, conditions, internal state counter, checkpoints, etc.
7.  **Events:** Signal key actions like deposits, withdrawals, tranche creation, condition updates, state changes.
8.  **Functions:** (Minimum 20) Cover deposits, tranche creation/management, condition management, withdrawals, state queries, guardian actions, checkpoints.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `depositEther()`: Allows users to deposit ETH into the vault.
2.  `depositToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens.
3.  `createTimeLockedTranche(uint256 amount, uint64 unlockTimestamp)`: Creates a new tranche unlocked after a specific timestamp.
4.  `createConditionalTranche(uint256 amount, uint32[] initialConditionIds)`: Creates a tranche linked to existing complex conditions.
5.  `addConditionToTranche(uint32 trancheId, uint32 conditionId)`: Adds an existing condition to a specific tranche's unlock requirements.
6.  `createTimeElapsedCondition(uint64 timeOffset)`: Creates a condition met after a certain time *since its creation*.
7.  `createInternalStateCondition(uint256 requiredStateValue)`: Creates a condition met when the internal state counter reaches or exceeds a value.
8.  `createSimulatedInteractionCondition(address targetContract, bytes data)`: Creates a condition based on the *simulated* read-only outcome of a call to another contract (requires a specific external oracle/actor to verify).
9.  `updateConditionStatus(uint32 conditionId, bool metStatus)`: Function callable by trusted oracle/guardian to signal an external condition is met.
10. `withdrawFromTranche(uint32 trancheId, uint256 amount)`: Attempts to withdraw from a specific tranche if all its conditions are met.
11. `withdrawAllUnlocked()`: Attempts to withdraw all available funds from all tranches where the caller is listed and conditions are met.
12. `addGuardian(address guardianAddress)`: Owner adds a guardian.
13. `removeGuardian(address guardianAddress)`: Owner removes a guardian.
14. `guardianEmergencyUnlock(uint32 trancheId)`: Guardian(s) can force unlock a specific tranche under predefined emergency rules (e.g., requiring multiple guardians). *Implementation detail: Requires a multi-sig check or similar logic.*
15. `recordStateCheckpoint()`: Records the current value of the internal state counter linked to the current timestamp.
16. `getTrancheDetails(uint32 trancheId)`: View function to get details about a tranche.
17. `getConditionDetails(uint32 conditionId)`: View function to get details about a condition.
18. `isTrancheUnlocked(uint32 trancheId)`: View function to check if all conditions for a specific tranche are met.
19. `getAvailableToWithdrawForTranche(uint32 trancheId, address user)`: View function to check how much a specific user can withdraw from one tranche.
20. `getAvailableToWithdrawTotal(address user)`: View function to check total withdrawable amount for a user across all tranches.
21. `getVaultState()`: View function to get the overall vault state.
22. `getLatestCheckpoint()`: View function to get the timestamp and value of the last recorded checkpoint.
23. `getInternalCounter()`: View function to get the current value of the internal state counter.
24. `incrementInternalCounter(uint256 value)`: Allows trusted roles (owner/guardian) to increment the internal state counter, potentially meeting conditions.
25. `getGuardianStatus(address addr)`: View function to check if an address is a guardian.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Tranches:** Instead of one monolithic vault, funds are segmented into `Tranche` structs. This allows different groups of funds to have entirely independent unlock rules, potentially serving different purposes or stakeholders.
2.  **Dynamic Condition Types:**
    *   `TimeElapsed`: Standard time lock, but based on the condition's *creation time*, making conditions reusable or applicable from different points in time.
    *   `InternalState`: Conditions tied to the contract's own internal state (`internalCounter`). This allows unlocks to depend on events or progress tracked *within* the smart contract itself (e.g., reaching a certain stage in a multi-step process).
    *   `SimulatedInteraction`: This is a creative concept. The contract *stores* metadata about an external call (`targetContract`, `externalCallData`) that *would* be used to check a condition (e.g., `targetContract.someViewFunction(args) == expectedValue`). However, the contract doesn't execute this call itself (as it could be expensive, or non-deterministic if it depends on external state fetched *during* execution). Instead, it relies on a trusted external oracle or guardian to *verify* the outcome of this simulated interaction off-chain and then call `updateConditionStatus` to mark the condition as met. This decouples complex or external checks from the on-chain execution cost and determinism requirements of condition verification.
3.  **Multi-Condition Unlocks:** A tranche is unlocked *only* when *all* linked conditions (`conditionIds`) are met (`_areTrancheConditionsMet`). This creates complex logical AND gates for fund release.
4.  **State Checkpoints:** The `recordStateCheckpoint` function allows capturing the value of `internalCounter` at a specific timestamp. This could be useful for auditing, verifying historical states, or potentially for more complex conditions based on state *at* a checkpoint rather than the current state.
5.  **Guardians & Emergency State:** A separate role with the ability to trigger an `Emergency` state and perform emergency withdrawals, overriding normal conditions. The `requireGuardianQuorum` modifier hints at more complex multi-signature logic for critical actions, though simplified in the demo implementation.
6.  **Vault State Enum:** The contract tracks an overall `VaultState` (`Locked`, `PartiallyUnlocked`, `FullyUnlocked`, `Emergency`) which provides a high-level overview and can gate certain actions (like emergency withdrawals).

This contract structure provides a flexible framework for managing funds with highly customizable and interdependent release schedules, moving beyond simple linear timelocks or single-condition releases.
