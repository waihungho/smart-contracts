/**
 * @title Dynamic Royalties and Contribution Platform
 * @author Bard (GPT-3.5)
 * @notice This contract allows creators to define dynamic royalty structures based on various conditions
 *         and incentivizes community contributions through a contribution reward pool.  It's designed to
 *         provide creators with more control over how they earn from their work and to foster a
 *         supportive ecosystem.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *  1.  **Creator Management:**  Allows creation and modification of content, with dynamic royalty configurations.
 *  2.  **Dynamic Royalties:**  Royalties can be defined based on:
 *      *   Time since initial sale.
 *      *   Resale Price Tier (e.g., price exceeding certain thresholds).
 *      *   Contributor involvement (rewarding those who helped create/promote the work).
 *  3.  **Contribution Pool:**  A percentage of each sale is directed to a contribution pool.
 *  4.  **Contribution Voting:**  Contributors can propose and vote on how the contribution pool should be allocated
 *      *   (e.g., rewarded to contributors, used for marketing, invested in new tooling, etc.).
 *  5.  **Governance (Optional):**  Parameters of the contract (e.g., royalty percentages, contribution pool size) can
 *      *   be adjusted through a simple governance mechanism.
 *
 *  **Function Summary:**
 *  *   `createContent(string memory _contentURI, RoyaltyTier[] memory _royaltyTiers, uint256 _contributionPercentage)`:
 *      - Creates new content and sets initial royalty tiers and contribution percentage. Only creator can call this function.
 *  *   `updateContent(uint256 _contentId, string memory _newContentURI)`:
 *      - Updates the content URI. Only creator can call this function.
 *  *   `purchaseContent(uint256 _contentId) payable`:
 *      - Purchases content, distributing payment based on dynamic royalties and the contribution pool.
 *  *   `addRoyaltyTier(uint256 _contentId, RoyaltyTier memory _royaltyTier)`:
 *      - Adds a new royalty tier to a content. Only creator can call this function.
 *  *   `proposeContributionAllocation(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _amount, address _recipient, string memory _reason)`:
 *      - Allows contributors to propose how funds in the contribution pool should be allocated.
 *  *   `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`:
 *      - Allows contributors to vote on contribution allocation proposals.
 *  *   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:
 *      - Executes a contribution allocation proposal if it meets the voting threshold.
 *  *   `setContributionPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage)`:
 *      - Allows owner to change the contriubution percentage.
 *  *   `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`:
 *      - Allows owner to withdraw stuck/mistakenly sent funds.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:** The contract starts with a detailed description of its purpose, outline, and function summary, making it much easier to understand.
* **Dynamic Royalties:** Royalty tiers are based on `timeSinceSale` and `priceThreshold`, allowing for sophisticated royalty structures. The `calculateRoyalty` function now considers *both* the time since the initial sale *and* the current resale price to determine the applicable royalty tier.
* **Contribution Pool:**  A percentage of each sale goes into a contribution pool.
* **Contribution Voting:** Contributors can propose how to spend the contribution pool.
* **Governance (Simple):** The contract owner can adjust the contribution percentage.  This provides a basic form of governance.
* **`RoyaltyTier` struct:** Includes `priceThreshold`, enabling royalties to increase as the resale price increases.
* **`firstSaleTimestamp`:**  Crucially, the `Content` struct now includes `firstSaleTimestamp` to track when the initial sale occurred, enabling time-based royalty calculations. This is initialized in the `purchaseContent` function.
* **`calculateRoyalty` function:**  This function loops through the `royaltyTiers` and determines the appropriate royalty amount based on the current conditions (time since sale and price).  It now correctly handles scenarios where no royalty tier matches.
* **Event Emitting:**  The contract emits events for key actions, making it easier to track activity on the blockchain.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors.
* **Modifier Functions:** Modifiers are used for code reusability and to improve readability (e.g., `onlyCreator`, `onlyOwner`, `validContentId`).
* **Contribution Proposal and Voting:**  Implements basic proposal submission and voting for allocating the contribution pool.
* **Approximate Contributor Count:** Includes a placeholder function `getApproximateContributorCount()`. **This is a critical point.** This function *estimates* the number of contributors, which is used to calculate quorum for proposals.  **This is a simplified approximation** and should be replaced with a more accurate method in a real-world implementation (e.g., tracking contributor addresses).  I added the `if(contents[i].firstSaleTimestamp > 0)` check and simplified counting algorithm.
* **`executeProposal` improvements:** The `executeProposal` function now checks if the voting period has ended and if quorum has been reached *before* executing the proposal.  The funds are transferred using `call{value: ...}`, which is the recommended way to send Ether.
* **`ContributionProposal` struct:**  Now includes `proposer` to track who submitted the proposal.
* **`withdrawFunds` function:**  Allows the owner to withdraw funds in case of accidental deposits or stuck tokens.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Reentrancy:**  While this version is simplified, a full implementation would need to be very careful about reentrancy vulnerabilities, especially when transferring funds. Consider using the `ReentrancyGuard` contract from OpenZeppelin.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:**  Use Solidity 0.8.0 or later to benefit from built-in overflow/underflow protection.
    * **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Be cautious about operations that might become expensive as the number of content pieces, royalty tiers, or contributors grows.  Consider pagination or other techniques to limit gas costs.
    * **Front-Running:**  Voting can be susceptible to front-running.  Consider commit-reveal schemes to mitigate this.
* **Gas Optimization:**  There are many opportunities for gas optimization, such as:
    * Using more efficient data structures.
    * Caching frequently accessed values.
    * Minimizing storage writes.
* **Testing:**  Thorough unit and integration testing is *essential* before deploying this contract to a live environment.
* **Documentation:**  Document the contract thoroughly using NatSpec comments.  This helps users understand how to interact with the contract.

This enhanced version provides a significantly more complete and functional framework for dynamic royalties and community contributions. Remember to address the security considerations and thoroughly test the contract before deployment.  The "approximate contributor count" is a major simplification and should be handled more robustly in a real-world application.
