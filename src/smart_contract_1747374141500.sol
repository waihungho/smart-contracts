Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines elements of prediction markets, decentralized data aggregation, and a simple form of on-chain governance, making it more complex and creative than standard examples.

We'll call it the "ChronoPredict Network". Users stake Ether (or a token) to predict the outcome of future real-world events. Oracles submit the actual outcomes, and users who predicted accurately share the total staked pool, proportionally to their accuracy. A governance mechanism allows adding new prediction topics or changing parameters.

**Concept:** A decentralized platform for staking on predictions about future data points, verified by multiple oracles, with rewards distributed based on prediction accuracy and a simple governance layer.

**Advanced Concepts Used:**
1.  **Parameterized Prediction Topics:** Topics are dynamically defined with specific parameters (cutoff times, resolution times, data types, scoring sensitivity).
2.  **Multi-Oracle Data Aggregation:** The contract requires multiple oracles to submit data and uses a consensus mechanism (e.g., median) to determine the final, verifiable outcome.
3.  **Accuracy-Based Proportional Rewards:** Rewards are not just binary (right/wrong) but are calculated based on the proximity of the user's prediction to the final verified outcome.
4.  **Staking with Time Locks & Penalties:** Staked funds are locked until resolution and potentially subject to delays or minor penalties upon early withdrawal (though we'll keep it simpler with just locks for this example).
5.  **On-Chain Governance (Basic):** Allows stakeholders (those with significant stake or specific tokens, let's use staked amount for simplicity) to propose and vote on adding new prediction topics or changing contract parameters.
6.  **State Machine:** Topics progress through distinct lifecycle states (Creation, Staking Open, Prediction Open, Resolving, Resolved, Payout Enabled, Closed).

**Outline & Function Summary**

**I. State Variables & Data Structures**
    *   `TopicState` Enum: Defines the lifecycle of a prediction topic.
    *   `Topic` Struct: Stores details about each prediction market topic (description, times, stakes, pool, state, etc.).
    *   `OracleData` Struct: Stores oracle submissions per topic.
    *   `Proposal` Struct: Stores governance proposal details.
    *   Mappings: To store topics, user stakes, user predictions, oracle data, proposals, votes, etc.
    *   Parameters: Global settings (e.g., oracle quorum, voting period, unstake delay).
    *   Addresses: Owner, list of registered oracles.

**II. Core Functionality - User Interactions**
    1.  `stakeForPrediction(uint256 topicId)`: User stakes Ether towards a specific topic's reward pool.
    2.  `submitPrediction(uint256 topicId, int256 predictionValue)`: User submits their predicted value for a topic.
    3.  `requestUnstake(uint256 topicId)`: User requests to unstake their funds after the prediction phase (requires a time lock).
    4.  `executeUnstake(uint256 topicId)`: User finalizes the unstaking after the lock period.
    5.  `claimRewards(uint256 topicId)`: User claims their calculated rewards after the topic is resolved.

**III. Core Functionality - Oracle Interactions**
    6.  `submitOracleData(uint256 topicId, int256 dataValue)`: Registered oracle submits their data for a resolved topic.

**IV. Core Functionality - Topic Management & Resolution**
    7.  `createPredictionTopic(string memory description, uint64 predictionCutoffTime, uint64 resolutionTime, uint256 minStakeAmount, uint256 predictionSensitivity)`: Admin (or later, governance) creates a new topic.
    8.  `resolveTopic(uint256 topicId)`: Trigger the resolution process (determine correct value from oracles, calculate scores).
    9.  `calculatePredictionScore(uint256 topicId, int256 prediction, int256 resolvedValue)`: Internal helper function to calculate a score based on prediction accuracy.
    10. `distributeRewards(uint256 topicId)`: Internal helper function to calculate and record individual user rewards after resolution.

**V. Governance Functionality**
    11. `proposeNewTopic(string memory description, uint64 predictionCutoffTime, uint64 resolutionTime, uint256 minStakeAmount, uint256 predictionSensitivity)`: User/staker proposes a new prediction topic via governance.
    12. `proposeParameterChange(uint256 paramIdentifier, uint256 newValue)`: User/staker proposes changing a contract parameter.
    13. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: User casts their vote on an active proposal (weighted by stake).
    14. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal (creates topic or changes parameter).

**VI. Admin/Oracle Management**
    15. `addOracle(address oracleAddress)`: Owner adds a new registered oracle.
    16. `removeOracle(address oracleAddress)`: Owner removes a registered oracle.
    17. `pauseContract()`: Owner can pause contract functionality in emergencies.
    18. `unpauseContract()`: Owner unpauses the contract.

**VII. View Functions (Read-Only)**
    19. `getTopicDetails(uint256 topicId)`: Get all details about a topic.
    20. `getUserStake(uint256 topicId, address user)`: Get the amount a user has staked on a topic.
    21. `getUserPrediction(uint256 topicId, address user)`: Get a user's prediction for a topic.
    22. `getTopicOracleData(uint256 topicId)`: Get submitted oracle data for a topic.
    23. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Get details about a governance proposal.
    24. `getEligibleReward(uint256 topicId, address user)`: Calculate a user's potential reward *before* claiming.
    25. `getRegisteredOracles()`: Get the list of registered oracle addresses.

*(Note: We have more than 20 functions, including both write and view functions, fulfilling the requirement.)*

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Predictive Staking & Rewards:** Goes beyond simple betting (win/lose) to a system where accuracy is proportionally rewarded. This encourages more nuanced prediction and allows users who are "close" to the correct answer to still earn part of the pool.
2.  **On-Chain Data Aggregation with Quorum:** The contract doesn't trust a single oracle. It mandates a minimum number of submissions (`oracleQuorum`) and uses a simple consensus mechanism (median in the internal `_resolveTopic` - though bubble sort is used as a simple example, a production system would use a more efficient sort or alternative consensus like trimmed mean or requiring identical values).
3.  **Dynamic Topic Creation via Governance:** The ability to propose and vote on *new prediction topics* directly on-chain via a staked-based governance mechanism makes the platform extensible and decentralized in terms of market creation, rather than being solely dictated by an admin.
4.  **Parameterizable:** Key parameters like `oracleQuorum`, `proposalVotingPeriod`, `governanceStakeThreshold`, and `predictionSensitivity` can be adjusted via governance. This allows the protocol to adapt over time based on community decisions without needing a full contract upgrade (for these specific parameters).
5.  **State Machine for Topics:** Each prediction topic has a clear lifecycle managed by the contract state. This ensures actions (staking, predicting, submitting data, claiming) are only possible during specific, appropriate phases.
6.  **Stake-Weighted Governance:** Voting power is tied to a user's total staked amount across the platform (conceptually, although the implementation needs careful consideration for efficiency). This aligns the incentives of voters with the health and success of the network.
7.  **Unstake Cooldown:** The `requestUnstake` and `executeUnstake` pattern with a cooldown period is a common mechanism in staking/DeFi to prevent flash withdrawals that could impact protocol stability or lead to front-running in some contexts (less critical here, but a standard pattern).

**Limitations and Production Considerations:**

*   **Gas Efficiency:** Iterating through mappings (`_getTotalStake`, `getRegisteredOracles`, potentially in `_getPredictors` if not using an array) is highly gas-inefficient and will fail if there are many users or topics. A real system needs to maintain arrays or use different data structures/patterns to track lists (like predictors, oracle addresses, users with stake) or calculate aggregates off-chain.
*   **Sorting Oracle Data:** The bubble sort is inefficient for resolution if many oracles submit data. A production contract would need a more gas-efficient sorting algorithm or a different consensus mechanism (e.g., require N identical submissions, or use a trusted off-chain process for sorting).
*   **Float/Fixed-Point Math:** Predictions and resolution values use `int256`. Scoring and reward distribution use integer division. This introduces potential precision loss. A system dealing with financial predictions might need fixed-point math libraries.
*   **Oracle Honesty:** While it requires multiple oracles, it doesn't prevent a cartel of oracles from submitting false data if they control the majority or quorum. More advanced oracle designs involve reputation, staking by oracles, or cryptoeconomic security models.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** There's no built-in mechanism to dispute oracle data or resolution outcomes.
*   **Parameter Changes:** The `proposeParameterChange` function only handles specific pre-defined `uint256` parameters. Changing more complex contract logic would require a proxy upgrade pattern, which adds significant complexity and is not included here.
*   **Front-running:** While less critical here than in DEXes, interactions like `submitPrediction` before a close cutoff time or calling `resolveTopic` exactly when quorum is met could potentially be subject to minor front-running.

This contract provides a relatively complex and interconnected system demonstrating several advanced concepts beyond typical single-purpose smart contracts, while acknowledging areas that would need further optimization and security hardening for production use.
