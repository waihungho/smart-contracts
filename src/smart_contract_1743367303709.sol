/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Reputation & Skill-Based Task DAO
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @notice A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that incorporates a dynamic reputation system and skill-based task assignment.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **DAO Governance & Membership:**
 * 1.  `proposeNewMember(address _memberAddress, string _reason)`: Allows members to propose new members with a justification.
 * 2.  `voteOnMembershipProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on pending membership proposals.
 * 3.  `removeMember(address _memberAddress, string _reason)`: Allows members to propose removal of existing members.
 * 4.  `voteOnMemberRemoval(uint _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on member removal proposals.
 * 5.  `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of DAO members.
 * 6.  `isMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAO.
 *
 * **Reputation System:**
 * 7.  `increaseReputation(address _memberAddress, uint _amount, string _reason)`: Increases a member's reputation (DAO controlled).
 * 8.  `decreaseReputation(address _memberAddress, uint _amount, string _reason)`: Decreases a member's reputation (DAO controlled).
 * 9.  `getReputation(address _memberAddress)`: Retrieves a member's reputation score.
 * 10. `getReputationThresholdForTask(uint _taskDifficulty)`:  Gets the reputation threshold required to participate in a task of a given difficulty level.
 *
 * **Skill Management:**
 * 11. `addSkill(string _skillName)`: Adds a new skill to the DAO's skill registry (DAO controlled).
 * 12. `endorseSkill(address _memberAddress, string _skillName)`: Members can endorse other members for specific skills.
 * 13. `getMemberSkills(address _memberAddress)`: Retrieves the skills endorsed for a member.
 * 14. `getSkillEndorsements(address _memberAddress, string _skillName)`: Gets the number of endorsements for a member for a specific skill.
 *
 * **Task Management & Assignment:**
 * 15. `createTask(string _taskTitle, string _taskDescription, string[] memory _requiredSkills, uint _taskDifficulty, uint _reward)`: Creates a new task within the DAO, specifying required skills and difficulty.
 * 16. `applyForTask(uint _taskId)`: Members can apply to be assigned to a task.
 * 17. `assignTask(uint _taskId, address _memberAddress)`: DAO can manually assign a task to a specific member (or based on automated algorithms - not implemented here for simplicity but concept shown).
 * 18. `submitTaskCompletion(uint _taskId, string _submissionDetails)`: Members submit their work upon task completion.
 * 19. `approveTaskCompletion(uint _taskId)`: DAO approves a completed task, triggering reward distribution and reputation increase.
 * 20. `markTaskAsFailed(uint _taskId, string _reason)`: DAO can mark a task as failed if not completed successfully.
 * 21. `getTaskDetails(uint _taskId)`: Retrieves details of a specific task.
 * 22. `getAvailableTasks()`: Returns a list of currently available tasks.
 * 23. `getMyAssignedTasks()`: Returns a list of tasks assigned to the caller.
 *
 * **Emergency & Utility:**
 * 24. `pauseContract()`:  Allows the DAO owner to pause critical functions in case of emergency.
 * 25. `unpauseContract()`: Allows the DAO owner to unpause the contract.
 * 26. `isPaused()`: Checks if the contract is currently paused.
 * 27. `setReputationThresholdMultiplier(uint _multiplier)`: Allows the DAO owner to adjust the reputation threshold multiplier.

**Explanation of Concepts and Advanced Features:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** The contract establishes a basic DAO structure with members, governance through proposals and voting (for membership and removal), and a defined purpose (task management and skill utilization).

2.  **Dynamic Reputation System:**
    *   **Reputation Score:** Members have a reputation score that can increase or decrease based on their contributions and performance within the DAO.
    *   **Reputation Thresholds:** Tasks are assigned difficulty levels, and a reputation threshold is calculated based on difficulty. This ensures that only members with sufficient reputation (and presumably experience/trust) can take on more challenging tasks. This is dynamic and controlled by `reputationThresholdMultiplier`.
    *   **Reputation for Incentives/Penalties:** Reputation is increased for successful task completion and decreased for failures, creating a feedback loop that encourages positive contributions.

3.  **Skill-Based Task Assignment:**
    *   **Skill Registry:** The contract maintains a registry of skills relevant to the DAO's activities.
    *   **Skill Endorsements:** Members can endorse each other for specific skills, creating a decentralized skill verification system.
    *   **Task Skill Requirements:** Tasks are created with specific skill requirements, ensuring that tasks are assigned to members with the necessary skills (or at least endorsements).
    *   **Reputation and Skills combined:** While not fully automated skill-based assignment *algorithm* in this basic contract, the foundation is laid. Reputation acts as a general trust/experience indicator, and skills provide more granular expertise verification. A more advanced version could automatically rank applicants for tasks based on skill endorsements and reputation.

4.  **Membership Governance:**
    *   **Proposal-Based Membership:** New members are added through a proposal and voting process by existing members, ensuring decentralized control over membership.
    *   **Member Removal Proposal:**  Similar to membership, removal is also proposal-based, protecting against arbitrary removal.

5.  **Task Management Workflow:**
    *   **Task Creation with Requirements:** Tasks are clearly defined with title, description, required skills, difficulty, and reward.
    *   **Task Application:** Members can explicitly apply for tasks, indicating their interest.
    *   **Task Assignment (Manual in this version):**  The DAO (represented by members) can assign tasks.  This could be automated in a more advanced iteration based on skill matching and reputation.
    *   **Task Submission and Approval:**  A clear workflow for task completion, submission, and DAO approval.
    *   **Reward Distribution:** Upon approval, the reward is transferred to the task completer.

6.  **Emergency Pause:** The `pauseContract()` and `unpauseContract()` functions provide a safety mechanism for the DAO owner to halt critical operations in case of unforeseen issues or vulnerabilities.

7.  **Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted for significant actions, allowing for off-chain monitoring and logging of DAO activities.

**Trendy and Creative Aspects:**

*   **Dynamic Reputation:**  Moves beyond simple static reputation systems to create a more engaging and responsive system.
*   **Skill-Based Focus:** Aligns with the trend of valuing skills and expertise in decentralized organizations.
*   **DAO Governance for Skills and Tasks:**  Applies DAO principles to the management of skills and task allocation, creating a more decentralized and community-driven approach to work within an organization.

**Important Notes and Further Improvements (Beyond 20 Functions):**

*   **Security:** This is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, thorough security audits are crucial to prevent vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control, etc.).
*   **Gas Optimization:**  The code is written for clarity, not necessarily gas optimization. For production, gas efficiency should be a major consideration (especially in loops and storage operations).
*   **Scalability:**  Some data structures (like iterating through tasks to get member skills) are not scalable for a very large DAO. Consider using more efficient indexing and data retrieval methods.
*   **Automated Task Assignment:** Implement an algorithm for automated task assignment based on skill matching, reputation, availability, etc. This would be a significant enhancement.
*   **Voting Mechanisms:**  Implement more sophisticated voting mechanisms (quadratic voting, weighted voting based on reputation, etc.) and quorum rules.
*   **Proposal Types:** Expand proposal types beyond membership and removal to include parameter changes, treasury spending, etc.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement finer-grained roles and permissions within the DAO.
*   **Off-Chain Integration:** Consider how this contract would interact with off-chain systems for task submission, communication, and more complex workflows.
*   **Treasury Management:** Integrate a proper treasury management system for handling DAO funds and task rewards.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Implement a mechanism for resolving disputes related to task completion or other DAO matters.
*   **Upgradeability:**  Consider making the contract upgradeable using proxy patterns for future improvements and bug fixes.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a more advanced and feature-rich Decentralized Dynamic Reputation & Skill-Based Task DAO. You can build upon these concepts to create a truly innovative and functional decentralized organization.
