/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Creative Projects - "ArtVerse DAO"
 * @author Gemini
 * @dev A DAO focused on funding, governing, and showcasing creative projects (art, music, writing, etc.)
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * I.  Membership & Governance:
 *     1. joinDAO(): Allows users to request membership by staking a certain amount of tokens.
 *     2. approveMembership(address _member): Governor-only function to approve pending membership requests.
 *     3. revokeMembership(address _member): Governor-only function to revoke membership.
 *     4. getMemberCount(): Returns the current number of DAO members.
 *     5. isMember(address _user): Checks if an address is a member of the DAO.
 *     6. proposeGovernor(address _newGovernor): Members can propose a new governor.
 *     7. voteOnGovernorProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on governor proposals.
 *     8. executeGovernorProposal(uint _proposalId): Governor (or timelock after successful vote) executes governor change.
 *     9. delegateVote(address _delegatee): Allow members to delegate their voting power to another member.
 *
 * II. Project Proposals & Funding:
 *     10. submitProjectProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint _fundingGoal, string memory _projectCategory, string memory _milestones): Members can submit project proposals.
 *     11. voteOnProjectProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _vote): Members vote on project proposals.
 *     12. getProjectProposalDetails(uint _proposalId): Returns detailed information about a specific project proposal.
 *     13. fundProject(uint _projectId): Members can contribute funds to a project once approved.
 *     14. withdrawProjectFunds(uint _projectId): Project creator can withdraw funds after reaching milestones and approval.
 *     15. reportMilestoneCompletion(uint _projectId, uint _milestoneIndex, string memory _report): Project creators can report milestone completion.
 *     16. approveMilestoneCompletion(uint _projectId, uint _milestoneIndex, bool _approve): Members vote to approve or reject milestone completion.
 *
 * III. Project Showcase & Reputation:
 *     17. submitProjectShowcase(uint _projectId, string memory _ipfsHash): Project creators can submit their completed project for showcase with IPFS hash.
 *     18. getProjectShowcase(uint _projectId): Retrieve the IPFS hash of a showcased project.
 *     19. rewardProjectCreator(uint _projectId): Governor-only function to reward project creators beyond initial funding based on community feedback.
 *     20. emergencyPauseDAO(): Governor-only function to pause critical DAO functionalities in case of emergency.
 *     21. resumeDAO(): Governor-only function to resume DAO functionalities after emergency pause.
