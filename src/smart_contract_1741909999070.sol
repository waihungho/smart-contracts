/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Your Name or Organization
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It allows members to join, submit art proposals, vote on art pieces, manage a treasury,
 * set up exhibitions, and implement advanced governance mechanisms for the collective.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership & Roles:**
 *    - `joinCollective(string _artistName, string _artistStatement) payable`: Allows users to join the collective by paying a membership fee and providing artist details.
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective, potentially with a refund mechanism (not implemented in this basic example).
 *    - `isMember(address _account) view returns (bool)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `getMemberInfo(address _account) view returns (string artistName, string artistStatement, uint256 joinTimestamp)`: Retrieves member information.
 *    - `setCurator(address _curator, bool _isCurator) onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner to designate curators who have special privileges (e.g., proposing exhibitions).
 *    - `isCurator(address _account) view returns (bool)`: Checks if an address is a curator.
 *
 * **2. Art Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _estimatedValue) payable`: Members can submit art proposals with details and an IPFS hash, requiring a submission fee.
 *    - `getArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId) view returns (Proposal)`: Retrieves details of a specific art proposal.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on art proposals.
 *    - `finalizeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyOwner`: After voting, the owner can finalize a proposal, marking it as accepted or rejected.
 *    - `getAcceptedArtPieces() view returns (uint256[] proposalIds)`: Returns a list of IDs of accepted art proposals.
 *
 * **3. Treasury & Financial Management:**
 *    - `depositFunds() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit funds into the collective's treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFunds(uint256 _amount) onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner (or potentially a governance mechanism) to withdraw funds from the treasury.
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 *    - `setMembershipFee(uint256 _fee) onlyOwner`: Allows the owner to change the membership fee.
 *    - `setSubmissionFee(uint256 _fee) onlyOwner`: Allows the owner to change the art submission fee.
 *
 * **4. Exhibition & Display (Conceptual):**
 *    - `proposeExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, uint256[] _artProposalIds, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime) onlyCurator`: Curators can propose exhibitions featuring selected accepted art pieces.
 *    - `getExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId) view returns (Exhibition)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 *    - `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on exhibition proposals.
 *    - `finalizeExhibitionProposal(uint256 _exhibitionId) onlyOwner`:  Owner finalizes exhibition proposals after voting.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions() view returns (uint256[] exhibitionIds)`: Returns a list of IDs of active (or finalized) exhibitions.
 *
 * **5. Advanced Governance (Basic Example - Can be expanded):**
 *    - `proposeNewMembershipFee(uint256 _newFee) onlyMember`: Members can propose changes to the membership fee.
 *    - `voteOnMembershipFeeProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on membership fee change proposals.
 *    - `finalizeMembershipFeeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyOwner`: Owner finalizes membership fee proposals after voting.
 *
 * **Events:**
 *    - `MemberJoined(address member, string artistName)`: Emitted when a new member joins.
 *    - `MemberLeft(address member)`: Emitted when a member leaves.
 *    - `ArtProposalSubmitted(uint256 proposalId, address proposer, string title)`: Emitted when an art proposal is submitted.
 *    - `ArtProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on an art proposal.
 *    - `ArtProposalFinalized(uint256 proposalId, bool accepted)`: Emitted when an art proposal is finalized.
 *    - `FundsDeposited(address depositor, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when funds are deposited.
 *    - `FundsWithdrawn(address withdrawer, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn.
 *    - `ExhibitionProposed(uint256 exhibitionId, address proposer, string title)`: Emitted when an exhibition is proposed.
 *    - `ExhibitionVoted(uint256 exhibitionId, address voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on an exhibition proposal.
 *    - `ExhibitionFinalized(uint256 exhibitionId, bool accepted)`: Emitted when an exhibition proposal is finalized.
 *    - `MembershipFeeProposed(uint256 proposalId, uint256 newFee)`: Emitted when a membership fee change is proposed.
 *    - `MembershipFeeVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on a membership fee change proposal.
 *    - `MembershipFeeFinalized(uint256 proposalId, uint256 newFee)`: Emitted when a membership fee change proposal is finalized.
