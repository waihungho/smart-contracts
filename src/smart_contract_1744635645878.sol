/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative AI Model Training DAO
 * @author Bard (AI-generated example, review and adapt for production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on
 * collaborative AI model training. This contract facilitates data contribution,
 * model architecture proposals, training rounds, model evaluation, and reward distribution
 * in a transparent and decentralized manner. It incorporates advanced concepts like reputation
 * systems, dynamic access control based on contribution, and mechanisms for model usage
 * and monetization within the DAO ecosystem.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **DAO Governance Functions:**
 * 1. `proposeNewRule(string memory description, bytes memory data)`: Allows DAO members to propose new rules or changes to the DAO parameters.
 * 2. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Allows DAO members to vote on active proposals.
 * 3. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes the voting threshold.
 * 4. `setQuorum(uint256 newQuorum)`:  DAO-governed function to change the quorum required for proposal approval.
 * 5. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 newVotingPeriod)`: DAO-governed function to change the voting period for proposals.
 * 6. `deposit()`: Allows members to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
 * 7. `withdraw(uint256 amount)`:  Allows members to withdraw funds from the DAO treasury (potentially with governance or role-based restrictions).
 *
 * **Data Contribution & Management Functions:**
 * 8. `contributeData(string memory dataHash, string memory metadata)`: Allows members to contribute data for model training, storing a hash and metadata.
 * 9. `voteOnDataContribution(uint256 contributionId, bool approve)`: DAO members vote on the quality and relevance of contributed data.
 * 10. `rewardDataContributors(uint256 contributionId)`: Rewards data contributors after their contribution is approved and used.
 * 11. `getDataContributionDetails(uint256 contributionId)`:  Retrieves details of a specific data contribution.
 *
 * **Model Architecture & Training Functions:**
 * 12. `proposeModelArchitecture(string memory architectureDescription, string memory modelHash)`: Allows members to propose AI model architectures.
 * 13. `voteOnModelArchitecture(uint256 architectureId, bool approve)`: DAO members vote on proposed model architectures to be used for training.
 * 14. `startTrainingRound(uint256 architectureId, uint256 datasetIds)`: Initiates a training round using a selected model architecture and dataset.
 * 15. `submitTrainingResult(uint256 trainingRoundId, string memory modelWeightsHash, string memory metrics)`: Allows trainers to submit model weights and performance metrics after a training round.
 * 16. `evaluateTrainingRound(uint256 trainingRoundId)`: DAO-governed function to evaluate the results of a training round and select the best performing model.
 *
 * **Reputation & Reward System Functions:**
 * 17. `getContributorReputation(address contributor)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a DAO member based on their contributions.
 * 18. `distributeRewards(uint256 trainingRoundId)`: Distributes rewards to contributors (data providers, model developers, trainers) based on their reputation and contribution to a successful training round.
 * 19. `stakeTokens()`: Allows members to stake tokens to increase their voting power or access certain DAO functionalities.
 * 20. `unstakeTokens()`: Allows members to unstake their tokens.
 *
 * **Utility & Access Functions:**
 * 21. `accessTrainedModel(uint256 modelId)`: Allows authorized members (based on contribution or staking) to access a trained AI model.
 * 22. `getDAOStats()`: Returns aggregated statistics about the DAO, such as number of members, proposals, trained models, etc.
 *
 * **Emergency & Admin Functions:**
 * 23. `pauseContract()`: Allows the DAO admin (or governance vote) to pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 * 24. `unpauseContract()`: Allows the DAO admin (or governance vote) to unpause the contract.
 * 25. `adminWithdrawFunds(address recipient, uint256 amount)`:  Admin function to withdraw funds from the treasury (potentially with governance override).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Collaborative AI Model Training Focus:** The core concept itself is trendy and advanced.  It leverages blockchain for coordinating and incentivizing a complex, collaborative process like AI model training. This goes beyond simple token contracts or DeFi.

2.  **DAO Governance for AI Training:**  Using DAO mechanisms (proposals, voting, execution) to govern data contribution, model architecture selection, training parameters, and model evaluation is a novel application of DAO principles.

3.  **Data Contribution and Quality Control:**  The `contributeData` and `voteOnDataContribution` functions address the critical aspect of data in AI.  Decentralizing data sourcing and quality control is essential for building robust, unbiased AI models in a decentralized environment.

4.  **Model Architecture Proposals and Voting:**  `proposeModelArchitecture` and `voteOnModelArchitecture` allow the community to participate in the creative process of designing AI models, fostering innovation and diverse approaches.

5.  **Training Rounds and Evaluation:** `startTrainingRound`, `submitTrainingResult`, and `evaluateTrainingRound` structure the decentralized training process. The `evaluateTrainingRound` function introduces the idea of DAO-governed model selection, which can incorporate various evaluation metrics and community feedback.

6.  **Reputation System (Simple):** `getContributorReputation` and the reputation updates within reward functions introduce a basic reputation system. This encourages quality contributions and long-term participation by rewarding valuable members.  A more advanced reputation system could be integrated (e.g., soulbound tokens representing reputation levels).

7.  **Dynamic Access Control (Example):** `accessTrainedModel` demonstrates a simple form of dynamic access control. Access to trained models is granted based on staking tokens or contributing data, incentivizing participation in the DAO. More complex access control mechanisms could be implemented using NFTs or role-based access.

8.  **Reward Distribution based on Contribution/Reputation:** `rewardDataContributors` and `distributeRewards` illustrate how to incentivize different types of contributions (data, model development, training) using DAO tokens. The reward distribution can be dynamically adjusted based on the success of training rounds and contributor reputation.

9.  **Staking for Voting Power and Access:** `stakeTokens` and `unstakeTokens` implement a staking mechanism. Staking can be used to increase voting power in proposals and potentially grant access to premium features or trained models.

10. **DAO Treasury Management:** `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `adminWithdrawFunds` functions manage the DAO's treasury, which is used to fund rewards, development, and other DAO activities.

11. **Emergency Pause/Unpause:** `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` provide a safety mechanism to temporarily halt critical contract functions in case of vulnerabilities or unforeseen issues, ensuring DAO security.

12. **DAO Statistics:** `getDAOStats` provides transparency by allowing anyone to view key metrics about the DAO's activity and growth.

**Important Notes:**

*   **ERC20 Integration:** This contract assumes a basic ERC20 token contract (`ERC20.sol`) is available. You would need to replace this with a real ERC20 implementation (like OpenZeppelin's ERC20) or deploy your own token contract separately and provide its address to the `CollaborativeAIDao` constructor.
*   **Off-Chain Data Handling:**  Data hashes (`dataHash`, `modelHash`, `modelWeightsHash`) are used to represent data stored off-chain (e.g., on IPFS, decentralized storage networks).  This contract focuses on the on-chain coordination and governance aspects. The actual AI model training and data storage would typically happen off-chain for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Security Considerations:** This is a complex contract example. **Thorough security audits are crucial before deploying any smart contract to a production environment.**  Consider potential vulnerabilities like reentrancy, access control issues, and unexpected behavior.
*   **Gas Optimization:** For a real-world deployment, gas optimization would be essential. Techniques like using `calldata`, efficient data structures, and careful function design should be employed.
*   **Scalability:** Blockchain itself has scalability limitations. For large-scale AI model training, layer-2 solutions or sidechains might be necessary to handle the volume of transactions and data interactions.
*   **Real-World Complexity:** Building a fully functional decentralized AI model training DAO is a significant undertaking. This contract provides a conceptual framework. Many more details and complexities would need to be addressed in a production-ready system, including robust identity management, data privacy, more sophisticated reward mechanisms, and integration with off-chain AI infrastructure.

This example provides a starting point for exploring the intersection of DAOs, blockchain, and collaborative AI model training. You can further expand upon these concepts and functions to create even more advanced and specialized smart contracts for decentralized AI initiatives.
