Okay, let's create a smart contract that incorporates several advanced and creative concepts: a "Quantum Vault".

This vault will hold assets (ETH and ERC20 tokens) and release them based on complex, multi-factor conditions that include time, state changes influenced by external "observations" (simulated via oracle or ZK proof verification), and even a concept of "quantum tunneling" for early access under specific, verifiable circumstances.

It's difficult to create something *completely* non-duplicative in the vast landscape of open-source contracts, but this aims for a novel *combination* of features, especially the state-dependent access, external proof influence, and the "tunneling" mechanism.

### Smart Contract: QuantumVault

**Concept:**
A secure vault for assets (ETH and ERC20) where release is governed by customizable conditions. These conditions can depend on standard factors like time, but also on internal contract states that transition based on external inputs (simulating observation/collapse) or verified proofs. It introduces a "Quantum Tunneling" mechanism allowing early withdrawal under specific, provable conditions (e.g., a ZK proof predicting a future state).

**Key Features:**
1.  **Multi-Asset Storage:** Holds ETH and various ERC20 tokens.
2.  **Complex Access Conditions:** Release rules based on addresses, tokens, amounts, time, contract state, and required external proof hashes.
3.  **Quantum State Simulation:** The contract has distinct states (Active, Superposition, Collapsed) that influence access.
4.  **State Collapse via Observation:** The state can transition from Superposition to Collapsed based on input from a trusted Oracle or verification of a Zero-Knowledge Proof.
5.  **ZK Proof Integration:** Interfaces with a mock/external ZK Verifier contract to validate proofs.
6.  **Oracle Integration:** Interfaces with a mock/external Oracle contract for external data inputs that can trigger state changes.
7.  **Role-Based Access:** Differentiates between Owner, Observers (who can trigger state updates), and users.
8.  **Quantum Tunneling Withdrawal:** Allows withdrawal *before* standard conditions are fully met, provided a specific ZK proof is verified, potentially with a penalty.
9.  **Dynamic Configuration:** Conditions, roles, and penalty rates can be updated by authorized parties.

**Outline:**

1.  **Pragma and License**
2.  **Error Definitions**
3.  **Interface Definitions** (for ERC20, Oracle, ZKVerifier)
4.  **Enum Definitions** (VaultState)
5.  **Struct Definitions** (AccessCondition)
6.  **Event Definitions**
7.  **State Variables** (Owner, roles, vault state, conditions mapping, balances mapping, external contract addresses, config parameters)
8.  **Modifiers** (onlyOwner, onlyObserver, whenState)
9.  **Constructor**
10. **Core Vault Functions** (Deposit ETH/ERC20)
11. **Configuration Functions** (Add/Update/Remove Conditions, Set Roles, Set External Addresses, Set Configs)
12. **Quantum State Management Functions** (Enter Superposition, Collapse State via Oracle/ZK)
13. **Access & Withdrawal Functions** (Check Eligibility, Request Conditional Withdrawal, Attempt Quantum Tunneling)
14. **Query Functions** (Get State, Get Conditions, Get Balances, Check Eligibility)
15. **Emergency/Admin Functions** (e.g., emergency withdrawal - simplified/conceptual for function count)

**Function Summary (More than 20):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, setting the owner.
2.  `depositETH() payable`: Allows users to deposit Ether into the vault.
3.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit a specific ERC20 token.
4.  `addAccessCondition(address user, address token, uint256 amount, uint40 releaseTime, VaultState requiredState, bytes32 requiredZKProofHash)`: Adds a new condition structure detailing who can access what assets under which criteria (time, state, optional proof).
5.  `updateAccessCondition(uint256 conditionId, address user, address token, uint256 amount, uint40 releaseTime, VaultState requiredState, bytes32 requiredZKProofHash, bool isActive)`: Modifies an existing access condition by ID.
6.  `removeAccessCondition(uint256 conditionId)`: Deactivates and conceptually removes an access condition.
7.  `requestConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 conditionId)`: Allows a user to attempt withdrawal based on a specific, predefined condition. Checks all criteria (user, time, state, optional proof requirement).
8.  `checkAccessEligibility(uint256 conditionId, address user)`: Public view function to check if a *specific* user meets the criteria for a *specific* condition *at the current moment* (excluding the ZK proof verification itself, just the hash requirement).
9.  `enterSuperposition()`: Owner/Admin initiates a state change to 'Superposition', indicating the vault is awaiting external input to determine its 'Collapsed' state.
10. `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: Owner/Admin sets the address of the trusted Oracle contract.
11. `updateStateViaOracle(uint256 oracleValue)`: An `observer` role calls this, providing data from the oracle. This triggers the state transition from Superposition to Collapsed based on the `oracleValue`. (Requires `oracleValue` to match a predefined trigger).
12. `setZKVerifierAddress(address _verifier)`: Owner/Admin sets the address of the trusted ZK Verifier contract.
13. `collapseStateViaZKProof(bytes calldata proof)`: A user can provide a ZK proof. If verified by the `IZKVerifier`, this triggers the state transition from Superposition to Collapsed, potentially setting the `collapsedStateResult`.
14. `attemptQuantumTunnelingWithdrawal(uint256 conditionId, bytes calldata proof)`: Allows withdrawal for a condition *before* `releaseTime` is met, *if* a provided ZK proof (potentially predicting a future state or proving eligibility under different rules) is verified. Applies a configurable penalty.
15. `addObserverRole(address observer)`: Owner grants the observer role.
16. `removeObserverRole(address observer)`: Owner revokes the observer role.
17. `isObserver(address account)`: View function to check if an address has the observer role.
18. `getVaultState()`: View function returning the current `VaultState`.
19. `getAccessCondition(uint256 conditionId)`: View function returning details of a specific condition.
20. `getTotalBalanceETH()`: View function returning the contract's total ETH balance.
21. `getTotalBalanceERC20(address token)`: View function returning the contract's total balance for a specific ERC20 token.
22. `configurePenaltyRate(uint256 percentage)`: Owner/Admin sets the penalty percentage for quantum tunneling withdrawals (e.g., 5 for 5%).
23. `getPenaltyRate()`: View function returning the current penalty rate.
24. `getCollapsedStateResult()`: View function returning the specific outcome value determined during state collapse.
25. `setRequiredOracleValueForCollapse(uint256 value)`: Owner sets the specific oracle value needed to trigger a collapse.
26. `setRequiredProofHashForCollapse(bytes32 proofHash)`: Owner sets the specific expected ZK proof hash needed to trigger a collapse.
27. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
28. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces contract ownership (sets owner to zero address).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Novelty:**

1.  **Quantum State Simulation (`VaultState`, `enterSuperposition`, `updateStateViaOracle`, `collapseStateViaZKProof`):**
    *   This is an analogy to quantum mechanics, where a system can exist in a superposition of states until observed, at which point it collapses into a definite state.
    *   The `Superposition` state is the indeterminate state. Access conditions that rely on the final `Collapsed` state cannot be met yet.
    *   `updateStateViaOracle` and `collapseStateViaZKProof` represent external "observations" or interactions that force the state to `Collapsed`. The specific `collapsedStateResult` can depend on the outcome of the observation (e.g., the oracle value or a value proven by the ZK proof).
    *   **Novelty:** Using contract state *explicitly* as a requirement in access control, and having that state transition depend on *external* verified data (oracle) or *external* verified proofs (ZK) in a way that influences subsequent access logic.

2.  **Access Conditions with State and Proof Dependencies (`AccessCondition`, `requestConditionalWithdrawal`):**
    *   Beyond simple time locks or address checks, conditions can require a specific `VaultState` (`Active`, `Collapsed`).
    *   Conditions can also require a specific `requiredZKProofHash`. The logic in `requestConditionalWithdrawal` is designed such that if `requiredZKProofHash` is set, the standard withdrawal path is blocked, forcing the user towards the `attemptQuantumTunnelingWithdrawal` function which handles proof verification.
    *   **Novelty:** Combining time, state, and optional ZK proof hash requirements within a single, structured access condition and linking the proof requirement to a distinct withdrawal mechanism.

3.  **Quantum Tunneling Withdrawal (`attemptQuantumTunnelingWithdrawal`):**
    *   This function simulates the idea of "tunneling" through a barrier (the standard conditions like time or required state).
    *   It allows withdrawal *before* the standard `releaseTime` or even potentially bypassing the `requiredState`, provided a `IZKVerifier.verifyPrediction` proof is validated.
    *   The `verifyPrediction` interface is conceptual; in a real application, it would check a ZK proof proving, for example, that the user *will* eventually meet the conditions, or that they meet alternative off-chain criteria that justify early release.
    *   It includes an optional penalty mechanism (`quantumTunnelingPenaltyRate`) to disincentivize premature withdrawal unless the proof's benefit outweighs the cost.
    *   **Novelty:** A withdrawal function specifically designed to *bypass* standard on-chain time/state checks based on the verification of a ZK proof, introducing a cost (penalty), and naming it after a quantum phenomenon.

4.  **Integrated External Verification (`IZKVerifier`, `IOracle`, `setZKVerifierAddress`, `setOracleAddress`):**
    *   The contract relies on external, trusted contracts (Oracle and ZK Verifier) to bring crucial off-chain information or verification results on-chain, which directly impacts the vault's state and access rules.
    *   **Novelty:** Explicitly integrating *both* oracle-based state updates *and* ZK-proof based state collapses/withdrawal bypasses within the same vault structure.

**Limitations and Considerations:**

*   **Mock Interfaces:** `IOracle` and `IZKVerifier` are mock interfaces. Implementing real, secure Oracle and ZK Verifier integration is complex and depends on specific protocols/libraries (Chainlink, Verkle Trees, etc.).
*   **ZK Proof Verification Cost:** On-chain verification of complex ZK proofs is computationally expensive (high gas costs). The `IZKVerifier.verify` and `verifyPrediction` functions in a real implementation would be gas-intensive.
*   **State Collapse Trigger:** The current implementation requires an `observer` or a user with a proof to *call* the collapse function. This is a manual step. An ideal system might involve automated triggers or Watchtower-like mechanisms.
*   **Balance Tracking:** The contract doesn't explicitly track which deposited funds are associated with which condition or user. It assumes the total contract balance is sufficient to cover all *active* and *eligible* conditions. For fine-grained control, deposit functions would need to link funds to conditions/recipients.
*   **Array vs. Mapping for Conditions:** Using an array (`accessConditions`) allows easy ID generation (index + 1) but makes deletion difficult (marked inactive instead). For a very large number of conditions, a mapping might be slightly more gas-efficient for updates/reads, but ID management becomes trickier.
*   **Security:** While basic checks are included, a production-grade contract would require extensive audits, especially around the interaction with external contracts and the complex withdrawal logic.

This contract provides a framework for exploring advanced concepts like state-dependent logic influenced by external data/proofs and alternative, proof-gated access mechanisms, wrapped in a creative "Quantum Vault" theme.
