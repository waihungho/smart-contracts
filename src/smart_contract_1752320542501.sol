Okay, let's create a smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Talent Pool (DATP). This concept combines elements of DAOs, reputation systems, staking, and decentralized task/gig management with on-chain dispute resolution via a jury system.

It's complex and incorporates several advanced ideas:

1.  **DAO Governance:** Protocol parameters (fees, dispute juror stake) are managed by token holders.
2.  **Staking:** Users stake tokens for eligibility in the dispute jury pool and potentially boosted reputation/rewards.
3.  **Reputation System:** Tracks user performance based on completed projects and ratings.
4.  **On-Chain Jury Dispute Resolution:** A system where staked token holders are randomly selected to vote on project disputes.
5.  **Escrow:** Funds for projects are held in escrow until completion or dispute resolution.
6.  **Native Token:** A utility and governance token for staking, rewards, and governance.

This contract is *conceptual* and high-level. A production system would require significantly more robust error handling, edge case management, gas optimization, security audits, and potentially external oracle interactions for certain data (though we'll avoid that for simplicity here). The jury randomness is also limited by blockchain determinism â€“ a real system might use VRFs or commit-reveal schemes.
