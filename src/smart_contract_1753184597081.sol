Here's a smart contract in Solidity that aims to incorporate several advanced, interesting, and creative concepts without directly duplicating widely known open-source implementations, focusing on a unique combination of features.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is for conceptual demonstration and educational purposes. It has not been formally audited and should **not** be used in production environments without rigorous security audits and testing. Some "advanced" features (like ZK Proofs, Oracles) are simulated or have placeholder integration, as full on-chain implementation of such complex systems is beyond a single contract's scope and often relies on off-chain components. The "non-duplication" refers to the *logic and specific combination of ideas*, while standard interfaces (like ERC-721 for SBTs) are implemented with custom logic to enforce unique characteristics (e.g., non-transferability).

 * @title AetherRepNexus
 * @author [Your Name/Alias Here]
 * @notice AetherRepNexus is a sophisticated smart contract designed to build a decentralized, meritocratic reputation and skill graph within a community. It leverages advanced concepts like dynamic Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), a multi-faceted reputation system, liquid democracy for governance, and reputation-gated predictive markets. The system aims to foster transparency, collaboration, and intelligent decision-making by linking on-chain activity, verifiable credentials, and community consensus to individual standing.
 *
 * @dev This contract attempts to implement advanced concepts by simulating or laying the groundwork for off-chain integration (e.g., ZK Proofs, Oracles). It avoids direct duplication of common open-source patterns by providing custom implementations for core logic, especially for Soulbound Token non-transferability and dynamic properties.
 */

/*
 * OUTLINE AND FUNCTION SUMMARY:
 *
 * Contract Name: AetherRepNexus
 * Purpose: Manages a decentralized reputation and skill graph using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), powers a liquid democracy governance model, and enables curated, reputation-gated prediction markets.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Soulbound Tokens (SBTs): Non-transferable tokens representing skills or achievements. Their levels and metadata can update dynamically based on on-chain actions or off-chain verified proofs.
 * - Reputation System: A quantifiable score reflecting a user's positive contributions, subject to decay and weighted endorsements from peers.
 * - Liquid Democracy Governance: A flexible voting system where users can directly vote or delegate their reputation-weighted voting power to trusted delegates.
 * - Curated Prediction Markets: Specialized markets where only users meeting certain reputation and skill criteria can participate, fostering more informed collective intelligence.
 * - Dynamic Access Control: A mechanism to grant or restrict access to features or resources based on a combination of a user's SBT holdings and their current reputation score.
 * - ZK Proof Integration (Simulated): Provides a mechanism to register hashes of off-chain zero-knowledge proofs, enabling privacy-preserving verification of complex data or computations without revealing underlying inputs.
 * - Attestation System: Allows trusted issuers to record verifiable attestations/credentials on-chain, linked to user identities.
 *
 *
 * Core Functions Grouped By Feature (Total: 27 Functions):
 *
 * I. Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) Management (ERC-721-like, non-transferable implementation):
 *    1. `mintSkillSBT(address _to, uint256 _skillTypeId, string memory _skillName, uint256 _initialLevel)`: Mints a new, non-transferable Skill SBT for a user for a specific skill type.
 *    2. `updateSkillSBTLevel(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newLevel)`: Updates the skill level of an existing SBT. Restricted to owner.
 *    3. `revokeSkillSBT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Revokes (burns) a Skill SBT, typically due to misconduct or outdated achievements.
 *    4. `getSkillSBTLevel(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves the current level of a given Skill SBT.
 *    5. `hasSkillSBT(address _owner, uint256 _skillTypeId)`: Checks if an address possesses an SBT for a specific skill type.
 *    6. `getTokenIdsForOwner(address _owner)`: Returns all SBT token IDs owned by a specific address.
 *    7. `sbtURI(uint256 _tokenId)`: Generates a dynamic URI for SBT metadata, reflecting its current level and status.
 *    8. `proposeSBTLevelUpdate(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newLevel, bytes32 _zkProofHash)`: Proposes an SBT level update, optionally referencing an off-chain ZK proof (direct update for demo).
 *
 * II. Reputation System:
 *    9. `grantReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: Awards reputation points to a user. Restricted.
 *    10. `slashReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: Deducts reputation points from a user. Restricted.
 *    11. `endorseContributor(address _contributor)`: Allows a user to endorse another, incrementing endorsement count.
 *    12. `getReputationScore(address _user)`: Retrieves the current total reputation score of a user, applying decay.
 *    13. `decayReputation(address _user)`: Triggers a calculation and application of reputation decay for a user.
 *    14. `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _decayRatePerDay)`: Sets the daily percentage decay rate for reputation. Governed.
 *
 * III. Liquid Democracy Governance:
 *    15. `proposeAction(string memory _description, address _target, bytes memory _calldata)`: Allows eligible users to propose an executable on-chain action.
 *    16. `delegateReputationVote(address _delegatee)`: Delegates a user's reputation-weighted voting power to another address.
 *    17. `undelegateReputationVote()`: Revokes any active delegation, restoring direct voting power.
 *    18. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote on an active proposal, weighted by the voter's (or their delegate's) current reputation.
 *    19. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has met its simplistic quorum and passed.
 *    20. `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a specific proposal (e.g., Active, Succeeded, Executed).
 *    21. `getDelegatee(address _voter)`: Returns the address to whom a voter has delegated their voting power.
 *
 * IV. Curated Prediction Markets (Reputation-Gated):
 *    22. `proposePredictionMarket(string memory _question, uint256 _closingTime, uint256 _minReputation, string[] memory _choices)`: Proposes a new prediction market, specifying min reputation for participation.
 *    23. `submitPrediction(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _choiceIndex, uint256 _stakeAmount)`: Participants submit their prediction with an ETH stake, meeting reputation thresholds.
 *    24. `resolvePredictionMarket(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _winningChoiceIndex, bytes memory _oracleProof)`: An authorized oracle resolves the market outcome. `_oracleProof` is a placeholder for off-chain verification.
 *    25. `claimPredictionWinnings(uint256 _marketId)`: Allows participants with correct predictions to claim their share of the staked ETH.
 *    26. `getMarketParticipantsCount(uint256 _marketId)`: Placeholder for counting unique participants (requires more complex tracking).
 *
 * V. Dynamic Access & Utility:
 *    27. `canAccessFeature(address _user, uint256 _requiredReputation, uint256 _requiredSkillTypeId, uint256 _requiredSkillLevel)`: Checks if a user meets a combination of reputation and SBT skill requirements.
 *    28. `submitAttestation(address _about, string memory _attestationType, bytes32 _attestationHash, bytes memory _signature)`: Allows a whitelisted attester to record a verifiable credential hash for an address.
 *    29. `getAttestationHash(address _attester, address _about, string memory _attestationType)`: Retrieves a specific attestation hash.
 *
 * VI. Administrative Functions (Minimal, often governed by DAO later):
 *    30. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership.
 *    31. `renounceOwnership()`: Relinquishes ownership.
 *    32. `setOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Sets the address authorized to resolve prediction markets.
