/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Art Curation and Investment (ArtDAO)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated DAO smart contract focused on art curation, investment, and community governance.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. DAO Core Functions:**
 *   - `initializeDAO(string _daoName, address[] _initialMembers, uint256 _quorumPercentage, uint256 _votingDuration)`: Initializes the DAO with name, members, quorum, and voting duration. (Admin Function, executed once)
 *   - `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a DAO member. (View Function)
 *   - `addMember(address _newMember)`: Allows DAO members to propose adding a new member through voting. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `removeMember(address _memberToRemove)`: Allows DAO members to propose removing a member through voting. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `updateQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newQuorumPercentage)`: Allows DAO members to propose changing the quorum percentage. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `updateVotingDuration(uint256 _newVotingDuration)`: Allows DAO members to propose changing the voting duration. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `getDAOName()`: Returns the name of the DAO. (View Function)
 *   - `getQuorumPercentage()`: Returns the current quorum percentage. (View Function)
 *   - `getVotingDuration()`: Returns the current voting duration. (View Function)
 *   - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the number of DAO members. (View Function)
 *
 * **2. Art Curation & Submission Functions:**
 *   - `submitArt(string _artTitle, string _artDescription, string _artCID)`: Allows anyone to submit art for curation consideration. (Public Function)
 *   - `voteOnArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Allows DAO members to vote on submitted art. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _submissionId)`: Returns the curation status of a submitted artwork. (View Function)
 *   - `getApprovedArtworks()`: Returns a list of IDs of artworks approved by the DAO. (View Function)
 *
 * **3. Treasury & Investment Functions:**
 *   - `depositToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the DAO treasury. (Payable Public Function)
 *   - `proposeInvestment(address _investmentContract, bytes _investmentData, string _investmentDescription)`: Allows DAO members to propose investments. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows DAO members to propose withdrawals from the treasury. (Member Function, Proposal-based)
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current ETH balance of the DAO treasury. (View Function)
 *
 * **4. Advanced Governance & Reputation Functions:**
 *   - `delegateVote(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power to another member. (Member Function)
 *   - `revokeDelegation()`: Allows members to revoke their vote delegation. (Member Function)
 *   - `getVotingPower(address _account)`: Returns the voting power of an account (including delegations). (View Function)
 *   - `contributeToDAO(string _contributionDescription)`: Allows members to record contributions to the DAO to potentially build reputation (Reputation system is conceptual in this example, further implementation needed). (Member Function)
 *   - `getMemberContributions(address _member)`: Returns a list of contribution descriptions for a member. (View Function)
 *
 * **5. Proposal & Voting System (Internal - Handled by modifiers and internal functions):**
 *   - `propose(string _description, ProposalType _proposalType, bytes _data)`: Internal function to create a new proposal.
 *   - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Internal function to cast a vote on a proposal.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Internal function to execute a proposal if it passes.
 *   - `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Internal function to get the status of a proposal.
 *
 * **Enum Definitions:**
 *   - `ProposalType`: Enum to define different types of proposals (e.g., MemberAddition, ParameterChange, Investment, Withdrawal).
 *   - `ProposalStatus`: Enum to represent the status of a proposal (e.g., Pending, Active, Passed, Rejected, Executed).

**Explanation of Advanced/Trendy Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Framework:** The core concept is a DAO, which is a trendy and advanced concept in blockchain. It enables community governance and decentralized decision-making.
2.  **Art Curation Focus:**  The DAO is specifically designed for art curation and investment, making it unique and relevant in the growing NFT and digital art space. This specialization is more creative than a generic DAO.
3.  **Proposal-Based Governance:** All significant actions (adding/removing members, parameter changes, investments, withdrawals, art curation) are handled through proposals and voting, showcasing a robust governance model.
4.  **Voting Power Delegation:**  The `delegateVote` and `revokeDelegation` functions implement vote delegation, a more advanced governance feature that allows members to entrust their voting power to other members, enhancing participation and representation.
5.  **Conceptual Reputation System (Contributions):** The `contributeToDAO` and `getMemberContributions` functions introduce a basic reputation system by allowing members to record their contributions. While not fully fleshed out (reputation score, tiered access etc. would be further advanced), it lays the groundwork for a more sophisticated reputation mechanism that could be used for future DAO features (e.g., weighted voting, curator roles, etc.).
6.  **Art Curation Workflow:** The `submitArt`, `voteOnArtSubmission`, and `getCurationStatus` functions define a decentralized art curation process, allowing the DAO to collectively decide which artworks to recognize, potentially acquire, or promote.
7.  **Treasury Management:** The `depositToTreasury`, `proposeInvestment`, `withdrawFromTreasury`, and `getTreasuryBalance` functions enable the DAO to manage a treasury and make collective investment decisions, demonstrating a practical application of DAO governance in financial management.
8.  **Function Diversity:** The contract includes over 20 distinct functions, covering a wide range of functionalities from core DAO operations to art-specific features and advanced governance mechanisms, fulfilling the requirement for a substantial number of functions.
9.  **Non-Duplication (Compared to Basic Open Source):** While DAOs and voting mechanisms are open source concepts, the specific combination of art curation, investment focus, vote delegation, and conceptual reputation system within a single contract aiming for 20+ functions makes it a more creative and less directly duplicative implementation than simple open-source examples. It's designed to be more feature-rich and specialized.
10. **Use of `delegatecall` for Proposal Execution:**  Using `delegatecall` for executing proposal data allows for flexible function calls within the contract itself, making the proposal system more versatile.
11. **Clear Events and Modifiers:**  The contract uses events extensively to track important actions and modifiers to enforce access control, which are best practices for smart contract development and enhance security and auditability.
12. **String Library for Descriptions:** The inclusion of a `Strings` library (even a basic one) to handle string conversions for proposal descriptions enhances the readability and informativeness of on-chain data.

**To further enhance this contract and make it even more advanced, you could consider adding features like:**

*   **NFT Integration:**  Represent approved artworks as NFTs.
*   **Fractional NFT Ownership:** Allow the DAO to fractionalize ownership of acquired art NFTs.
*   **Staking Mechanism:** Implement a staking mechanism for DAO tokens (if you were to add a DAO token) to further incentivize participation and potentially tie voting power to stake.
*   **Quadratic Voting:** Implement a quadratic voting system for proposals for more nuanced decision-making.
*   **Reputation System Enhancement:** Develop the reputation system further with quantifiable scores, tiered access, and reputation-based rewards/roles.
*   **Integration with DeFi Protocols:**  Explore ways to integrate with DeFi protocols for treasury management and investment strategies.
*   **Layered Governance:** Implement different tiers of membership and governance roles with varying privileges and responsibilities.
*   **Sub-DAOs or Committees:** Allow for the creation of sub-DAOs or specialized committees within the main DAO to manage specific aspects like art curation, investment research, etc.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a sophisticated and creative ArtDAO, incorporating various advanced concepts and going beyond basic open-source examples in its functionality and design. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a live network.
