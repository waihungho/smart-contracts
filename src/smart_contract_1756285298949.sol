This smart contract, `AetherialCanvasDAO`, introduces a novel concept by combining **dynamic generative NFTs** with an **AI Oracle-influenced evolution engine** and a **Curatorial DAO**. It enables NFTs to autonomously evolve over time, react to AI insights, and be collectively governed by token holders. The design prioritizes creativity, advanced concepts, and trend-aware features without directly duplicating existing open-source projects.

## AetherialCanvasDAO Smart Contract

### Contract Overview

The `AetherialCanvasDAO` contract serves as the central hub for a collection of dynamic, evolving generative art NFTs, referred to as "Canvases." Each Canvas is an ERC721 token whose visual parameters and traits are stored directly on-chain and can change over time. The contract integrates an AI oracle for external influence and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for collective governance.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic NFTs (Canvases):** NFTs are not static images. Their metadata (`tokenURI`) is dynamically generated based on evolving on-chain parameters, reflecting changes in their "appearance" over time. The actual rendering of the art happens off-chain using these on-chain parameters.
2.  **Generative Algorithms:** The DAO approves various "generative algorithms" which serve as templates for new NFTs. Each algorithm defines initial parameters and specific rules for how a Canvas created from it can evolve.
3.  **Evolution Engine:** Canvases evolve based on a combination of factors:
    *   **Time:** A global frequency dictates how often a Canvas is eligible to evolve.
    *   **AI Oracle Influence:** A trusted external AI oracle can submit "inspiration scores" and "mood tags" that influence a Canvas's evolution trajectory, nudging its parameters based on AI-driven aesthetic analysis or creative prompts.
    *   **Owner/Community Interaction:** Owners can pay a fee to "reroll" certain parameters, and any user can pay a small fee to "trigger" the evolution of an eligible Canvas, encouraging participation.
4.  **Curatorial DAO:** Governed by `AETH` token holders (referred to as "Curators"), the DAO is responsible for:
    *   Approving new generative algorithms.
    *   Modifying global evolution parameters (e.g., frequency).
    *   Proposing direct parameter changes to specific Canvases (e.g., for curated exhibitions).
    *   Managing the contract's treasury funds collected from minting and evolution fees.
    *   A basic **reputation system** is integrated, where successful proposal contributions positively impact a curator's voting power, while failed proposals can negatively affect it.
5.  **Treasury & Royalties:** Funds from minting fees, reroll fees, and default ERC2981 royalties flow into the contract's treasury. The DAO votes on how these funds are allocated or withdrawn.

### Roles

*   **`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`**: Has the highest privileges, typically held by a multisig or trusted entity, for critical administrative tasks like setting the initial oracle address or granting other roles.
*   **`ORACLE_ROLE`**: Granted to the trusted AI oracle address, allowing it to submit inspiration data to NFTs.
*   **`DAO_EXECUTOR_ROLE`**: Granted to an address (or a multisig/DAO contract) responsible for executing successful proposals passed by the DAO.

### Function Summary (20+ Custom Functions)

#### NFT Management (Inherits standard ERC721 functions like `transferFrom`, `approve`, `ownerOf`, etc.)

1.  **`mintInitialCanvas(uint256 _algorithmId, address _to)`**: Mints a new Aetherial Canvas NFT to `_to`, initialized with parameters from an approved `_algorithmId`. Requires a small ETH minting fee.
2.  **`tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Generates a dynamic, base64-encoded JSON metadata URI for a given Canvas, reflecting its current evolution stage, parameters, and AI influence.
3.  **`getCanvasParameters(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Returns the raw, ABI-encoded generative parameters of a Canvas, intended for off-chain rendering.
4.  **`freezeCanvas(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Prevents a Canvas from evolving further. Callable by the NFT owner or `DAO_EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
5.  **`unfreezeCanvas(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Re-enables evolution for a frozen Canvas. Callable by the NFT owner or `DAO_EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
6.  **`requestCanvasReroll(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Allows the NFT owner to pay a fee to trigger a semi-randomized adjustment of their Canvas's parameters within its algorithm's rules, effectively "rerolling" its look.
7.  **`triggerCanvasEvolution(uint256 _tokenId)`**: Initiates the evolution process for a Canvas if it's eligible (not frozen, and enough time has passed since last evolution). Applies evolution rules and AI oracle influence. Requires a small fee to incentivize external callers.

#### Generative Algorithm Management (DAO)

8.  **`proposeGenerativeAlgorithm(string memory _name, string memory _description, bytes memory _initialParameters, bytes memory _evolutionRules)`**: Creates a DAO proposal to introduce a new generative algorithm template with its initial parameters and evolution rules. Requires `minAETHStakeForCuratorship`.
9.  **`getGenerativeAlgorithm(uint256 _algorithmId)`**: Retrieves the details (name, description, parameters, rules, approval status) of a generative algorithm.

#### Oracle Interaction

10. **`submitOracleInspiration(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _inspirationScore, string memory _aiMoodTag)`**: Allows an address with `ORACLE_ROLE` to submit AI-generated inspiration data (score and mood tag) for a specific Canvas. This data influences its future evolution.
11. **`setOracleAddress(address _newOracleAddress)`**: Grants the `ORACLE_ROLE` to a new address. Callable by `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

#### DAO Governance (Curatorship & Proposals)

12. **`proposeParameterChange(string memory _description, uint256 _canvasId, bytes memory _newParameters)`**: Creates a DAO proposal to directly set new generative parameters for a specific Canvas. Requires `minAETHStakeForCuratorship`.
13. **`proposeGlobalSettingChange(string memory _description, uint224 _settingType, bytes memory _newValue)`**: Creates a DAO proposal to change a global contract setting (e.g., `globalEvolutionFrequency`, `royaltyFeeNumerator`, `royaltyRecipient`). Requires `minAETHStakeForCuratorship`.
14. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: Allows a Curator to cast a "Yes" or "No" vote on an active proposal. Voting power is derived from staked AETH and reputation.
15. **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executed by an address with `DAO_EXECUTOR_ROLE` after the voting period ends. Checks quorum and majority to determine if the proposal passes, then applies the proposed changes and adjusts curator reputation.
16. **`stakeForCuratorship(uint256 _amount)`**: Allows users to stake `AETH` tokens to gain voting power and become a Curator.
17. **`unstakeFromCuratorship()`**: Allows a Curator to unstake their `AETH` tokens.
18. **`getCuratorVotingPower(address _curator)`**: Calculates and returns a curator's current voting power based on their staked `AETH` and reputation score.
19. **`getCuratorReputation(address _curator)`**: Returns the reputation score of a specific curator.
20. **`setGlobalEvolutionFrequency(uint256 _intervalSeconds)`**: (Internal/privileged, executed via DAO proposal) Sets the minimum time interval required between evolutions for any Canvas.

#### Treasury & Royalties (Inherits standard ERC2981 `royaltyInfo` and `setDefaultRoyalty`)

21. **`setRoyaltyRecipient(address _recipient)`**: (Internal/privileged, executed via DAO proposal) Sets the default address to receive ERC2981 royalties from secondary sales.
22. **`setRoyaltyFee(uint96 _feeNumerator)`**: (Internal/privileged, executed via DAO proposal) Sets the default royalty percentage (e.g., `250` for 2.5%).
23. **`withdrawTreasuryFunds(address _to, uint256 _amount)`**: (Internal/privileged, executed via DAO proposal) Allows withdrawal of funds from the contract's treasury to a specified address.
24. **`getTreasuryBalance()`**: Returns the current ETH balance held in the contract's treasury.
