Okay, let's design a smart contract that simulates a "Decentralized Self-Improving AI Strategy". The core idea is that the contract manages a set of parameters (the "AI Strategy") which is conceptually improved over time through a decentralized process. Users contribute potential improvements (proposals) and vote on them using a native points system (`IntelligencePoints`). Successful proposals modify the strategy and contributors are rewarded. This incorporates concepts like decentralized governance, incentivized contributions, staked voting, and a form of on-chain "learning" or evolution.

This contract is a *simulation* of an AI improvement process on-chain. It doesn't run AI algorithms itself (which is too gas-intensive and complex for standard EVM), but manages the *governance and incentive structure* for how a conceptual AI strategy evolves based on community input and evaluation.

**Smart Contract: DecentralizedSelfImprovingAI**

**Concept:** A decentralized system managing a conceptual "AI Strategy" represented by parameters. Users contribute data references and strategy proposals. A staked voting mechanism determines which proposals are successful. Successful proposals update the AI Strategy and reward contributors and voters. Uses a native `IntelligencePoints` system for staking and rewards.

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Store core strategy parameters, user balances/stakes, proposals, data contributions, voting round info, system parameters (stakes, rewards, voting thresholds).
2.  **Structs:** Define data structures for Proposals, Data Contributions, Voting Rounds.
3.  **Events:** Announce key actions like contributions, proposals, votes, strategy updates, rewards.
4.  **Modifiers:** Access control (e.g., `onlyOwner`, `whenVotingRoundActive`).
5.  **IntelligencePoints (Native Logic):** Functions for managing the internal point system (minting, transferring for stakes/rewards).
6.  **Participation Staking:** Stake points to gain eligibility for submitting proposals/voting.
7.  **Data Contribution:** Allow users to submit references to external data sets (off-chain) potentially useful for the AI.
8.  **Strategy Proposal:** Allow users to submit proposals to change the AI Strategy parameters, requiring a stake.
9.  **Voting Rounds:** Mechanism to initiate, manage, and end voting periods for queued proposals.
10. **Voting:** Allow staked participants to vote on active proposals, staking points on their chosen outcome.
11. **Evaluation & Strategy Update:** Logic to determine winning proposals based on votes, update the main strategy parameters, and distribute rewards/penalties.
12. **Reward Claiming:** Users claim their earned IntelligencePoints.
13. **Query Functions:** Provide read access to contract state (balances, proposals, strategy, round info).
14. **Admin Functions:** Owner-controlled functions for initializing parameters, starting/ending rounds (can be decentralized later via governance).

**Function Summary (at least 20):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes contract with basic parameters and mints initial points (e.g., to owner/treasury).
2.  `stakeForParticipation(uint256 amount)`: Stakes `amount` IntelligencePoints to meet participation requirements.
3.  `unstakeParticipation()`: Unstakes participation points if eligible (e.g., no active proposals/votes).
4.  `submitDataContribution(string memory metadataHash)`: Records a user's data contribution reference.
5.  `submitStrategyProposal(uint256[] memory newStrategyParameters, string memory descriptionHash, uint256 stakeAmount)`: Submits a proposal with proposed parameters and stake.
6.  `startNewVotingRound()`: (Admin) Initiates a voting round for queued proposals.
7.  `castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool approveProposal, uint256 voteAmount)`: Casts a vote (approve/reject) on a proposal with stake.
8.  `endVotingRound()`: (Admin) Ends the active voting round, triggers evaluation.
9.  `evaluateProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: (Internal/Called by `endVotingRound`) Evaluates a single proposal's outcome.
10. `integrateSuccessfulProposals()`: (Internal/Called by `endVotingRound`) Updates the main strategy based on winning proposals.
11. `distributeRewardsAndPenalties()`: (Internal/Called by `endVotingRound`) Calculates and allocates rewards/penalties.
12. `claimRewards()`: Allows users to claim their accumulated earned IntelligencePoints.
13. `getAvailableIntelligencePoints(address user)`: Returns user's available points balance.
14. `getStakedParticipationPoints(address user)`: Returns user's currently staked participation points.
15. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific proposal.
16. `getVotingRoundState()`: Returns information about the current or last voting round.
17. `getCurrentStrategyParameters()`: Returns the array of current AI Strategy parameters.
18. `getDataContributionCount()`: Returns the total number of data contributions submitted.
19. `getProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of strategy proposals submitted.
20. `getRequiredParticipationStake()`: Returns the minimum points required for participation staking.
21. `setRequiredParticipationStake(uint256 amount)`: (Admin) Sets the participation stake requirement.
22. `setVotingParameters(uint256 duration, uint256 quorumNumerator, uint256 thresholdNumerator, uint256 denominator)`: (Admin) Sets voting round parameters.
23. `setRewardParameters(uint256 baseRewardPerVote, uint256 proposalAcceptanceRewardMultiplier, uint256 penaltyMultiplier)`: (Admin) Sets reward/penalty rules.
24. `mintInitialPoints(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: (Admin) Mints initial points (for bootstrapping).
25. `transferIntelligencePoints(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: (Internal/Admin) Allows internal point transfer or initial distribution. *Let's make this internal and only exposed via admin minting for bootstrapping.*
