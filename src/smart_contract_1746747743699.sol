Okay, let's design a smart contract that goes beyond the basics, incorporating several interconnected, advanced concepts. We'll call it "The Chronos Collective" - a decentralized entity focused on collaborative forecasting, dynamic asset management, and liquid reputation-based governance.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Reputation System:** A non-transferable on-chain score representing contributions and accuracy.
2.  **Dynamic Assets:** NFTs (tracked internally for simplicity, not a full ERC721 implementation to avoid duplication) that evolve their traits based on holder reputation or collective state.
3.  **Liquid Reputation Governance:** Voting weight is based on reputation, and users can delegate their reputation-based voting power to others.
4.  **Decentralized Forecasting Module:** Members submit forecasts on future events, and accurate forecasts are rewarded (boosting reputation and potentially dynamic asset traits). Outcome resolution is handled via governance or a decentralized oracle mechanism.
5.  **Community Treasury & Project Funding:** Treasury managed by governance, allowing funding for projects proposed and potentially co-funded by members.

Let's aim for 20+ distinct functions covering these areas.

// --- Contract Outline ---
// 1. State Variables: Core addresses, counters, mappings for reputation, assets, proposals, forecasts, projects.
// 2. Structs & Enums: Define complex data types for proposals, forecasts, projects, dynamic assets, states.
// 3. Events: Signal key actions and state changes.
// 4. Modifiers: Custom checks (e.g., min reputation).
// 5. Core Setup: Constructor, linking external contracts (like the ChronosToken).
// 6. Reputation Management: Functions to gain, lose, and query reputation.
// 7. Dynamic Asset Tracker: Functions to mint, update, transfer, and query dynamic assets (acting like unique IDs/NFTs internally).
// 8. Liquid Reputation Governance: Functions for creating proposals, voting, delegating voting power.
// 9. Treasury Management: Deposit funds, trigger withdrawals via governance.
// 10. Forecasting Module: Functions for submitting, revealing, resolving forecasts, and claiming rewards.
// 11. Project Funding Module: Functions for proposing projects, contributing funds, and evaluating outcomes.
// 12. Parameter Management: Functions (via governance) to update system parameters.
// 13. View Functions: Query various states and data.

// --- Function Summary ---

// Core Setup:
// 1. constructor(address initialOwner, address initialChronosToken): Deploys and sets initial configurations.
// 2. setChronosToken(address newTokenAddress): Allows owner (or governance) to set the ChronosToken address. (Consider governance later)
// 3. renounceOwnership(): Standard Ownable function.

// Reputation Management:
// 4. gainReputation(address user, uint256 amount): Internal/restricted function to increase user reputation.
// 5. loseReputation(address user, uint256 amount): Internal/restricted function to decrease user reputation.
// 6. getReputation(address user) view: Returns a user's current reputation.

// Dynamic Asset Tracker (Internal NFT-like):
// 7. mintDynamicAsset(address recipient, uint256 assetType): Mints a new dynamic asset ID for a user.
// 8. updateDynamicAssetTrait(uint256 assetId, uint256 traitIndex, uint256 newValue): Updates a specific trait of a dynamic asset. Can be triggered by reputation changes, forecast accuracy, etc.
// 9. transferDynamicAsset(address from, address to, uint256 assetId): Transfers ownership of a dynamic asset. (Could add conditions like reputation cost)
// 10. burnDynamicAsset(uint256 assetId): Burns a dynamic asset.
// 11. getDynamicAssetData(uint256 assetId) view: Returns the data/traits of a specific dynamic asset.
// 12. getDynamicAssetOwner(uint256 assetId) view: Returns the owner of a dynamic asset.
// 13. getUserDynamicAssets(address user) view: Returns an array of asset IDs owned by a user (potentially limited for gas).

// Liquid Reputation Governance:
// 14. createProposal(string memory description, address target, bytes memory callData, uint256 value): Creates a new governance proposal. Requires min reputation.
// 15. vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support): Casts a vote on a proposal. Voting weight is based on user's effective reputation (including delegation).
// 16. delegateVotingPower(address delegatee): Delegates reputation-based voting power to another address.
// 17. undelegateVotingPower(): Removes delegation.
// 18. executeProposal(uint256 proposalId): Executes a successful proposal after the voting period.

// Treasury Management:
// 19. depositTreasury(): Allows anyone to send Ether to the contract treasury.
// 20. withdrawTreasury(uint256 amount): Function to withdraw funds (only callable via a successful governance proposal).

// Forecasting Module:
// 21. submitForecast(uint256 eventId, bytes32 hashedForecast, uint256 lockStake): Submits a hashed forecast before reveal period. Requires locking tokens/reputation.
// 22. revealForecast(uint256 eventId, string memory actualForecast): Reveals the original forecast string during the reveal period.
// 23. resolveForecast(uint256 eventId, string memory actualOutcome, address[] memory accurateParticipants): Callable (by oracle/governance) to set the true outcome and specify accurate participants.
// 24. claimForecastReward(uint256 eventId): Allows accurate participants to claim rewards (tokens/reputation/asset updates).

// Project Funding Module:
// 25. proposeProject(string memory details, uint256 requestedFunding, uint256 fundingGoalCommunity): Proposes a project for community/treasury funding.
// 26. contributeToProject(uint256 projectId, uint256 amount): Allows members to contribute their own tokens to a proposed project.
// 27. evaluateProject(uint256 projectId, string memory outcomeDetails, address[] memory successfulParticipants): Callable (by governance) to evaluate a completed project's success and reward participants.

// Parameter Management (Via Governance Proposals):
// 28. updateMinReputationForProposal(uint256 newMinReputation): Updates the minimum reputation required to create a proposal.
// 29. updateVotingPeriodDuration(uint256 newDuration): Updates the duration for voting periods.
// 30. updateReputationGainAmount(uint256 newAmount): Updates the amount of reputation gained for certain actions.

// View Functions:
// 31. getProposalState(uint256 proposalId) view: Returns the current state of a proposal.
// 32. getEffectiveVotingWeight(address user) view: Returns a user's reputation plus any delegated reputation.
// 33. getForecastState(uint256 eventId) view: Returns the current state of a forecast event.
// 34. getProjectState(uint256 projectId) view: Returns the current state of a project proposal.
// 35. getProjectContributions(uint256 projectId) view: Returns the total community contributions for a project.

// Note: Implementing a truly secure and decentralized oracle for forecast resolution (function 23) is complex and often relies on off-chain components or specific oracle protocols (like Chainlink). For this example, we'll make it callable by a designated address or require governance approval.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Reputation System (`s_reputation`):** This isn't just a score; it's the *basis* for voting power and dynamic asset traits, making participation and positive contributions directly impactful within the ecosystem, independent of transferable tokens.
2.  **Dynamic Asset Tracker (`s_dynamicAssets`, `updateDynamicAssetTrait`):** Instead of static NFTs, these assets (conceptually unique IDs with data) change based on on-chain events like reputation gain/loss or successful forecast participation. This creates living, evolving digital items representing status, achievements, or even fluctuating ownership value tied to performance. Implementing it internally avoids duplicating a standard ERC721.
3.  **Liquid Reputation Governance (`delegateVotingPower`, `getEffectiveVotingWeight`):** This combines reputation-based voting with the liquid democracy concept. Users can delegate their earned reputation voting power to others (experts, representatives), allowing for scalable participation and potentially more informed voting outcomes, distinct from simple token delegation.
4.  **Decentralized Forecasting Module (`submitForecast`, `revealForecast`, `resolveForecast`, `claimForecastReward`):** This implements a commit-reveal scheme for decentralized predictions on future events. Rewarding accurate forecasters aligns incentives, leverages collective intelligence, and can feed back into the reputation/dynamic asset systems. The `resolveForecast` function highlights the crucial, often complex, oracle problem, here partially handled by assuming a trusted party or future governance integration.
5.  **Community Project Funding (`proposeProject`, `contributeToProject`, `evaluateProject`):** A multi-stage process where projects are proposed, community interest is gauged via contributions, and then governance decides on treasury funding and evaluates success, feeding outcomes back into the reputation system. This is a more complex funding DAO model.
6.  **Governance-Controlled Parameters (`updateMinReputationForProposal`, etc.):** Critical system parameters are not hardcoded but are upgradeable *only* via a successful governance proposal, making the contract truly decentralized and adaptable. The `onlyByGovernance` pattern is a common, secure way to handle this.

This contract provides a framework for a complex, self-sustaining decentralized ecosystem where reputation, dynamic digital identity, collective intelligence, and community-driven funding are interconnected through governance. While certain parts (like robust oracle integration or efficient mapping iteration for views) would require further development or off-chain components in a production system, the structure demonstrates a range of advanced and creative Solidity concepts.
