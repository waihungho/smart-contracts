 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)

 * @dev This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) on the blockchain.
 * It allows artists to join the collective, submit artwork proposals, participate in curation votes,
 * mint and sell NFTs of their accepted artwork, and govern the collective's treasury and operations.
 * This contract aims to be unique and explore advanced concepts in decentralized art and governance,
 * avoiding direct duplication of common open-source patterns while drawing inspiration from them.

 * **Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `requestMembership()`: Artists can request to join the collective.
 *    - `voteOnMembership()`: Existing members vote on membership requests.
 *    - `approveMembership()`: (Admin/Curators) Can directly approve membership.
 *    - `revokeMembership()`: Remove a member from the collective (governance vote).
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members.
 *    - `isMember()`: Checks if an address is a member.

 * **2. Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork()`: Members can submit artwork proposals with metadata.
 *    - `voteOnArtworkSubmission()`: Members vote on submitted artwork proposals.
 *    - `setCuratorRole()`: Assign a curator role to an address for artwork moderation.
 *    - `removeCuratorRole()`: Remove a curator role.
 *    - `isCurator()`: Checks if an address is a curator.
 *    - `getArtworkSubmissionDetails()`: Retrieves details of an artwork submission.

 * **3. NFT Minting & Sales:**
 *    - `mintNFT()`: Mints an NFT of approved artwork for the submitting artist.
 *    - `setNFTPrice()`: Artist can set the price of their minted NFT.
 *    - `buyNFT()`: Allows anyone to purchase an NFT.
 *    - `withdrawArtistShare()`: Artists can withdraw their earnings from NFT sales.
 *    - `getNFTDetails()`: Retrieves details of an NFT.

 * **4. Governance & Voting:**
 *    - `createProposal()`: Members can create general governance proposals.
 *    - `voteOnProposal()`: Members can vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal()`: Executes a passed governance proposal (if executable function is defined).
 *    - `getProposalDetails()`: Retrieves details of a governance proposal.

 * **5. Treasury Management:**
 *    - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 *    - `fundProposalFromTreasury()`: Propose to fund a proposal from the treasury.
 *    - `withdrawFromTreasury()`: (Governance Approved) Withdraw funds from the treasury for a specific purpose.

 * **6. Community & Engagement:**
 *    - `createArtChallenge()`:  Initiate an art challenge with specific themes/rewards.
 *    - `participateInChallenge()`: Members can submit artwork to participate in a challenge.
 *    - `voteOnChallengeWinners()`: Members vote to select winners of an art challenge.
 *    - `distributeChallengeRewards()`: Distribute rewards to challenge winners from the treasury.

 * **7. Utility & Admin:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`:  Owner can pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Owner can unpause contract functions.
 *    - `setVotingPeriod()`: Owner can set the default voting period for proposals.
 *    - `setQuorum()`: Owner can set the quorum required for votes to pass.
 *    - `setPlatformFeePercentage()`: Owner can set the platform fee percentage on NFT sales.
 *    - `emergencyWithdraw()`: Owner can withdraw stuck ETH in extreme emergencies.
 *    - `transferOwnership()`: Standard ownership transfer.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Theme:** The contract is designed around the concept of a DAAC, allowing artists to collectively manage and benefit from their art in a decentralized way.

2.  **Membership and Governance:**
    *   **Membership Request & Voting:**  A process for artists to request membership and for existing members to vote, showcasing a basic DAO membership model.
    *   **Curator Roles:** Introduction of curator roles for moderation and potentially more specialized tasks, adding a layer of delegation within the DAO.
    *   **Governance Proposals & Voting:** A general proposal system for members to propose and vote on changes or actions within the collective, demonstrating basic on-chain governance.
    *   **Quorum & Voting Period:**  Parameters for governance, allowing control over voting thresholds and durations.

3.  **Artwork Submission & Curation:**
    *   **Artwork Proposals:** Artists submit artwork proposals, which are then subject to a curation process.
    *   **Voting on Artwork:** Members vote on artwork submissions, creating a decentralized curation mechanism.

4.  **NFT Minting and Sales:**
    *   **NFT Minting for Approved Art:**  NFTs are minted only for artwork that has been approved through the curation process, ensuring quality and community validation.
    *   **Artist-Set NFT Prices:** Artists retain control over pricing their NFTs.
    *   **Platform Fee & Treasury:** A platform fee is automatically deducted from NFT sales and deposited into the collective's treasury, demonstrating a revenue model for the DAO.

5.  **Treasury Management:**
    *   **Treasury Balance Tracking:** The contract maintains a treasury balance, accumulating platform fees.
    *   **Treasury Funding Proposals:**  A mechanism to propose and potentially fund projects or initiatives from the treasury through governance.
    *   **Governance-Approved Withdrawals:**  Withdrawals from the treasury require governance approval, ensuring community oversight of funds.

6.  **Community Engagement - Art Challenges:**
    *   **Art Challenges:**  The contract includes functionality for creating and managing art challenges with themes and rewards, fostering community engagement and artistic creation.
    *   **Challenge Submissions & Voting:**  Members can participate in challenges and vote on challenge winners, creating a gamified and collaborative art environment.
    *   **Reward Distribution:**  Rewards from the treasury are distributed to challenge winners, incentivizing participation.

7.  **Utility and Admin Functions:**
    *   **Pausable Contract:**  A standard security feature to pause critical functions in case of emergencies.
    *   **Parameter Setting:**  Functions to adjust key parameters like voting period, quorum, and platform fee, allowing for dynamic governance.
    *   **Emergency Withdraw:**  A safety mechanism for the owner to withdraw stuck funds in extreme cases.

**Trendy and Creative Aspects:**

*   **DAAC Concept:** Decentralized Autonomous Art Collectives are a trendy concept within the NFT and Web3 space, representing a new organizational model for artists.
*   **Community-Driven Curation:**  The voting-based curation of artwork is a creative approach to quality control and community involvement in art selection.
*   **Art Challenges for Engagement:**  The inclusion of art challenges is a creative way to foster community participation, artistic expression, and gamification within the collective.
*   **On-Chain Governance for Art:**  Implementing governance mechanisms for art-related decisions (curation, treasury use, etc.) is an advanced and forward-thinking approach.

**Important Notes and Further Improvements (For a Real-World Contract):**

*   **Gas Optimization:**  The `getMemberCount()` and challenge winner selection loops are highly inefficient and not scalable for a real-world contract.  For production, you would need to maintain a list or more efficient data structure for members and submissions.
*   **Voting Mechanisms:** The voting system is very simplified. For a real DAO, consider using more robust on-chain voting mechanisms (e.g., quadratic voting, token-weighted voting) or off-chain solutions like Snapshot integrated with on-chain execution.
*   **Proposal Execution:** The `executeProposal()` function is a placeholder. In a real system, you would need a more structured way to define and execute proposal actions (e.g., using function selectors and parameters, or a more complex governance framework).
*   **Error Handling and Security:**  More robust error handling, input validation, and security considerations (reentrancy protection, overflow/underflow checks, access control) are crucial for production contracts.
*   **Event Logging:** Events are used extensively for off-chain monitoring and indexing, which is good practice.
*   **Metadata Standards:** For real NFTs, adhere to established metadata standards (e.g., ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema) for better interoperability.
*   **Scalability:** Consider scalability solutions for a growing DAO, such as layer-2 solutions or more efficient on-chain data management.

This contract provides a foundation for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective and explores various advanced concepts.  Remember that this is a conceptual example, and building a production-ready DAO requires careful planning, security audits, and potentially more sophisticated governance and technical implementations.
