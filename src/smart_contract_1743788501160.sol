/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - Not for Production)
 * @notice A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, showcasing advanced concepts.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Gallery Functions:**
 * 1. `submitArt(string _title, string _artistName, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _price)`: Artists submit their artwork to the gallery.
 * 2. `approveArt(uint256 _artId)`: Curators (or DAO) approve submitted artwork for exhibition.
 * 3. `rejectArt(uint256 _artId)`: Curators (or DAO) reject submitted artwork.
 * 4. `purchaseArt(uint256 _artId)`: Users purchase artwork listed in the gallery.
 * 5. `listArtForSale(uint256 _artId, uint256 _price)`: Art owners can list purchased art for resale within the gallery.
 * 6. `unlistArtForSale(uint256 _artId)`: Art owners can unlist their art from sale.
 * 7. `transferArtOwnership(uint256 _artId, address _newOwner)`: Art owners can transfer ownership outside the gallery system (standard NFT transfer).
 * 8. `burnArt(uint256 _artId)`: Art owners can permanently burn their artwork, removing it from circulation.
 * 9. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Gallery owner sets the platform fee percentage on sales.
 * 10. `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Gallery owner withdraws accumulated gallery fees.
 *
 * **DAO & Governance Functions:**
 * 11. `nominateCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: DAO members nominate addresses to become curators.
 * 12. `voteForCurator(address _curatorAddress, bool _support)`: DAO members vote for or against nominated curators.
 * 13. `enactCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: If a curator nomination receives enough support, a function to enact them as curator.
 * 14. `removeCurator(address _curatorAddress)`: DAO members can propose and vote to remove a curator.
 * 15. `createProposal(string _proposalDescription, bytes _calldata)`: DAO members can create governance proposals with arbitrary function calls.
 * 16. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: DAO members vote on active governance proposals.
 * 17. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: If a proposal passes, a function to execute the proposal's calldata.
 *
 * **Advanced & Creative Functions:**
 * 18. `sponsorArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _sponsorAmount)`: Users can sponsor artwork they appreciate, directly rewarding the artist.
 * 19. `bidOnArt(uint256 _artId)`: Users can bid on artwork in an auction-like system (if enabled for specific artworks).
 * 20. `redeemArtForPhysicalToken(uint256 _artId)`: (Hypothetical) If the gallery supports physical redemptions, owners can redeem their digital art for a physical token/certificate.
 * 21. `setArtRoyalty(uint256 _artId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Artists can set a royalty percentage on secondary sales of their art.
 * 22. `claimRoyalties(uint256 _artId)`: Artists can claim accumulated royalties from secondary sales.
 * 23. `donateToGallery()`: Users can donate ETH to the gallery's treasury for operational support.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Integration:**
    *   **Curator Nomination and Voting:**  Implements a basic DAO-driven curator selection process. DAO members (represented by `daoMembers` array - in a real DAO, this would be token holders) can nominate and vote for curators. This introduces decentralized governance to the gallery.
    *   **Governance Proposals:** Allows DAO members to create and vote on proposals that can execute arbitrary function calls within the contract. This enables the DAO to control various aspects of the gallery, from changing parameters to implementing new features.

2.  **Advanced Art Management:**
    *   **Art Burning:**  Provides a mechanism for artists or owners to permanently destroy digital art, adding scarcity and potentially influencing value.
    *   **Art Royalties:** Implements a basic royalty system where artists can earn a percentage of secondary sales. This is a crucial aspect of empowering digital artists in the NFT space.
    *   **Sponsorship:** Allows users to directly support artists by sponsoring their work, creating a direct patronage model within the gallery.
    *   **Auction (Example - Basic):** Includes a very simplified `bidOnArt` function to illustrate how auction-like features could be incorporated. A full auction system would be more complex but shows the potential for dynamic pricing and sales mechanisms.
    *   **Physical Redemption (Hypothetical):** The `redeemArtForPhysicalToken` function is a conceptual example of bridging the digital and physical art worlds. It shows how a smart contract could potentially interact with external systems for physical redemptions (though this would require significant off-chain infrastructure).

3.  **Creative and Trendy Functions:**
    *   **Donation to Gallery:**  Allows users to directly donate to the gallery, creating a community-supported model and potentially funding gallery operations or future developments.
    *   **Fallback/Receive for Donations:** The `receive()` function makes it easy for users to donate ETH to the contract simply by sending ETH to the contract address.
    *   **Proposal System for Innovation:** The DAO proposal system is inherently creative as it allows the community to propose and implement new functionalities and changes to the gallery over time, making it adaptable and evolving.

4.  **Non-Duplication from Open Source (Intent):**
    *   While core concepts like NFT ownership, marketplaces, and basic DAO functionalities are present in many open-source contracts, this example aims to combine them in a unique way within the "Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery" theme. The specific combination of functions, especially the advanced and creative ones (sponsorship, physical redemption concept, royalty system combined with DAO governance), is designed to be less commonly found in existing open-source templates.  It focuses on building a holistic and feature-rich gallery experience.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Example Contract:** This contract is provided as an illustrative example and is **not intended for production use without thorough security audits and further development.**
*   **Simplified DAO:** The DAO implementation is simplified for demonstration purposes. A real-world DAO would likely use token-based voting, more robust quorum and voting mechanisms, and potentially more sophisticated proposal execution.
*   **Security:**  Security vulnerabilities are not the primary focus of this example. A production-ready contract would require rigorous security audits to prevent exploits.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Gas optimization is not extensively addressed in this example for clarity. Real-world contracts would benefit from gas optimization techniques.
*   **External Systems:** Functions like `redeemArtForPhysicalToken` are conceptual and would require integration with external systems to be fully functional.
*   **Royalty Tracking:** The royalty system is simplified. A real-world implementation would need more robust tracking of royalty amounts owed to artists.

This example provides a starting point for a creative and feature-rich smart contract concept, showcasing how advanced concepts and trendy ideas can be incorporated into blockchain applications.
