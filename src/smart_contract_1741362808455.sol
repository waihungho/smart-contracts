 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) where artists can mint NFTs representing their artwork,
 *      the community can curate and vote on artworks for exhibition, and users can interact with the gallery in various ways.
 *      This contract focuses on advanced concepts like DAO governance, dynamic royalties, community curation,
 *      and innovative exhibition mechanisms, aiming to be a unique and engaging platform for digital art.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 *  **Art NFT Management:**
 *    1. mintArtNFT(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _royaltyPercentage): Mint a new artwork NFT.
 *    2. transferArtOwnership(uint256 _tokenId, address _to): Transfer ownership of an artwork NFT.
 *    3. burnArtNFT(uint256 _tokenId): Burn/destroy an artwork NFT (requires owner or admin).
 *    4. getArtDetails(uint256 _tokenId): View detailed information about a specific artwork NFT.
 *    5. setArtRoyalty(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _newRoyaltyPercentage): Set a new royalty percentage for an artwork (only by artist).
 *
 *  **Exhibition & Curation:**
 *    6. submitArtForExhibition(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _exhibitionDescription): Submit an artwork for exhibition consideration.
 *    7. voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Community members vote on exhibition proposals.
 *    8. createExhibitionProposal(string memory _exhibitionTitle, string memory _exhibitionTheme, uint256 _votingDeadline): Create a new exhibition proposal.
 *    9. getExhibitionProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId): View details of an exhibition proposal and voting status.
 *    10. finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Finalize an exhibition after voting and distribute rewards (admin/curator).
 *    11. setExhibitionFee(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _fee): Set an entry fee for a specific exhibition (admin/curator).
 *    12. enterExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Allow users to enter an exhibition by paying the fee (if any).
 *
 *  **DAO Governance & Community:**
 *    13. createGovernanceProposal(string memory _proposalTitle, string memory _proposalDescription, uint256 _votingDeadline): Create a general governance proposal.
 *    14. voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Community members vote on governance proposals.
 *    15. delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee): Delegate voting power to another address.
 *    16. stakeTokens(uint256 _amount): Stake platform tokens to gain voting power and potentially rewards.
 *    17. unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount): Unstake platform tokens.
 *    18. withdrawStakingRewards(): Withdraw accumulated staking rewards.
 *    19. addCurator(address _newCurator): Add a new curator to manage exhibitions (governance vote required).
 *    20. removeCurator(address _curatorToRemove): Remove a curator (governance vote required).
 *    21. setPlatformFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage): Set the platform fee percentage on art sales (governance vote required).
 *    22. withdrawPlatformFees(): Admin/Curator can withdraw accumulated platform fees for gallery maintenance.
 *
 *  **Utility Functions:**
 *    23. pauseContract(): Pause core contract functionalities (admin only - emergency).
 *    24. unpauseContract(): Unpause contract functionalities (admin only).

**Explanation of Functions and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **`mintArtNFT(...)`**: Standard NFT minting but includes `royaltyPercentage`. This demonstrates dynamic royalties, an important concept for supporting artists in the NFT space.

2.  **`transferArtOwnership(...)`**: Basic NFT transfer.

3.  **`burnArtNFT(...)`**: NFT burning capability, useful for certain art lifecycle scenarios or community governance decisions.

4.  **`getArtDetails(...)`**: Function to retrieve structured information about an NFT, making the contract more data-rich.

5.  **`setArtRoyalty(...)`**: Allows the artist to adjust their royalty percentage dynamically, offering flexibility.

6.  **`submitArtForExhibition(...)`**: Introduces the concept of community curation. Artists can propose their NFTs for exhibitions.

7.  **`voteOnExhibitionProposal(...)`**: Implements a voting mechanism for community members to decide which artworks get exhibited, a core feature of a DAO-governed gallery.

8.  **`createExhibitionProposal(...)`**: Curators can propose themed exhibitions, moving beyond just individual artwork submissions.

9.  **`getExhibitionProposalDetails(...)`**:  Provides visibility into the status of exhibition proposals and voting outcomes.

10. **`finalizeExhibition(...)`**:  Based on voting results, exhibitions are finalized, and if approved, an exhibition instance is created.

11. **`setExhibitionFee(...)`**: Exhibitions can have entry fees, creating a potential revenue stream for the gallery or its DAO.

12. **`enterExhibition(...)`**:  Allows users to pay an entry fee (if set) to "enter" an exhibition (conceptually).

13. **`createGovernanceProposal(...)`**:  General governance proposals allow the community to suggest changes to the platform itself.

14. **`voteOnGovernanceProposal(...)`**:  Voting on governance proposals, enabling community-driven decision-making for the gallery's evolution.

15. **`delegateVotingPower(...)`**:  Users can delegate their voting power to trusted community members, increasing participation.

16. **`stakeTokens(...)`**:  Simulated token staking. In a real system, this would be linked to a platform token. Staking provides governance power and potentially rewards.

17. **`unstakeTokens(...)`**:  Unstaking tokens.

18. **`withdrawStakingRewards(...)`**: Placeholder for a staking rewards mechanism (needs further implementation in a real token ecosystem).

19. **`addCurator(...)`**:  Adding curators through governance (in this simplified example, admin-controlled, but should be DAO-governed in a real scenario). Curators help manage exhibitions.

20. **`removeCurator(...)`**: Removing curators through governance.

21. **`setPlatformFeePercentage(...)`**: Changing the platform's fee percentage on art sales or exhibition entries via governance.

22. **`withdrawPlatformFees(...)`**:  Allows curators/admin to withdraw platform fees collected for gallery maintenance or DAO treasury.

23. **`pauseContract(...)`**: Emergency pause function for security.

24. **`unpauseContract(...)`**: Unpause function after resolving an emergency.

**Advanced/Trendy Concepts Used:**

*   **DAO Governance:**  Voting mechanisms for exhibitions and platform changes.
*   **Community Curation:**  Community decides which art gets exhibited.
*   **Dynamic Royalties:**  Artists can set and adjust royalties on their NFTs.
*   **Staking for Governance:**  Simulated staking to represent voting power.
*   **Exhibition Fees:**  Potential revenue generation for the platform/DAO.
*   **Curator Roles:**  Defined roles for managing exhibitions.
*   **General Governance Proposals:**  Platform evolution driven by the community.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified Staking/Tokenomics:**  The staking and reward mechanisms are very simplified in this example. A real-world implementation would require integration with a proper ERC20 token contract and a more robust reward distribution system.
*   **Voting Power:**  Voting power is simplified to one vote per address. In a real DAO, voting power would be weighted based on token holdings, staked amounts, or other factors.
*   **Security:**  This is a conceptual example and would need thorough security auditing and best practices implemented for a production-ready contract.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This code is written for clarity and demonstration of concepts, not necessarily for gas optimization. Real-world contracts would need gas optimization.
*   **Error Handling and Events:**  The contract includes basic error handling with `require` statements and emits events for important actions, which is good practice for smart contracts.
*   **String Library:** The `Strings` library from OpenZeppelin Contracts is included to enable converting `uint256` to `string` for proposal titles, which is a common need in smart contracts.

This contract provides a solid foundation and demonstrates a wide range of advanced concepts in a creative and trendy "Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery" context, fulfilling the requirements of your request while aiming to be unique and not directly replicating any single open-source project.
