/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Creative Projects (DAOCreative)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a DAO focused on fostering and funding creative projects.
 *      It incorporates advanced concepts like quadratic voting, reputation-based governance,
 *      dynamic funding mechanisms, and community-driven curation.
 *
 * **Contract Outline:**
 *
 * **1. DAO Governance & Membership:**
 *    - `joinDAO()`: Allows users to request membership by staking tokens.
 *    - `approveMembership(address _member)`: DAO members can vote to approve new members.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: DAO members can vote to revoke membership.
 *    - `setGovernanceParameter(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)`:  DAO-governed parameter setting (e.g., quorum, voting duration).
 *    - `proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue, string memory _description)`:  Propose changes to DAO governance parameters.
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Vote on governance proposals.
 *
 * **2. Creative Project Proposals & Funding:**
 *    - `submitProjectProposal(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectDescription, uint256 _fundingGoal, string memory _milestones)`: Submit a creative project proposal.
 *    - `voteOnProjectProposal(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _votes)`: DAO members vote on project proposals using quadratic voting (votes are squared cost).
 *    - `fundProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)`:  Members can contribute funds to approved projects.
 *    - `requestMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId)`: Project creators request milestone completion approval.
 *    - `voteOnMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId, bool _approve)`: DAO members vote on milestone completion.
 *    - `releaseMilestoneFunds(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId)`: Release funds for completed milestones.
 *    - `cancelProject(uint256 _projectId)`: DAO can vote to cancel a project if milestones are not met or project fails.
 *
 * **3. Reputation & Incentives:**
 *    - `contributeToProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)`:  General contribution function, rewards reputation.
 *    - `rewardReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`:  DAO can reward members for positive contributions.
 *    - `penalizeReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: DAO can penalize members for negative actions.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: View a member's reputation score.
 *
 * **4. Advanced & Trendy Features:**
 *    - `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Members can delegate their voting power to another member.
 *    - `stakeTokensForBoost(uint256 _boostAmount)`: Members can stake extra tokens for temporary voting power boost.
 *    - `withdrawStakedBoost()`: Withdraw staked tokens used for voting boost.
 *    - `emergencyPauseDAO(string memory _reason)`: Emergency pause function by DAO owner for critical situations.
 *    - `resumeDAO()`: Resume DAO operations after emergency pause.
 *    - `transferDAOOwnership(address _newOwner)`: Transfer contract ownership to a new address (DAO-governed).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * 1. **joinDAO()**: Allows users to request membership by staking a predefined amount of DAO tokens.
 * 2. **approveMembership(address _member)**: DAO members vote to approve pending membership requests.
 * 3. **revokeMembership(address _member)**: DAO members vote to revoke membership from existing members.
 * 4. **setGovernanceParameter(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)**: Allows the DAO to change governance parameters like quorum or voting durations through a proposal process.
 * 5. **proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue, string memory _description)**: Members propose changes to governance parameters, requiring a DAO vote.
 * 6. **voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)**: Members vote on governance change proposals.
 * 7. **submitProjectProposal(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectDescription, uint256 _fundingGoal, string memory _milestones)**:  Members submit creative project proposals with details, funding goals, and milestones.
 * 8. **voteOnProjectProposal(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _votes)**: DAO members vote on project proposals using quadratic voting (more votes cost proportionally more tokens squared, promoting wider participation but making it costly to dominate).
 * 9. **fundProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)**: DAO members contribute funds to approved projects.
 * 10. **requestMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId)**: Project creators request approval for completed project milestones.
 * 11. **voteOnMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId, bool _approve)**: DAO members vote to approve or reject milestone completion requests.
 * 12. **releaseMilestoneFunds(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneId)**: If a milestone is approved, release funds to the project creator for that milestone.
 * 13. **cancelProject(uint256 _projectId)**: DAO can vote to cancel a project if milestones are not met or the project is deemed to be failing.
 * 14. **contributeToProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)**:  General contribution function to projects, rewarding contributors with reputation points.
 * 15. **rewardReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)**: DAO can reward members with reputation points for positive actions and contributions.
 * 16. **penalizeReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)**: DAO can penalize members with reputation point deductions for negative actions.
 * 17. **getMemberReputation(address _member)**: Allows anyone to view a member's reputation score within the DAO.
 * 18. **delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)**: Members can delegate their voting power to another DAO member they trust.
 * 19. **stakeTokensForBoost(uint256 _boostAmount)**: Members can stake additional tokens to temporarily boost their voting power for a specific period.
 * 20. **withdrawStakedBoost()**: Allows members to withdraw tokens staked for voting power boost after the boost period ends.
 * 21. **emergencyPauseDAO(string memory _reason)**:  DAO owner (initially contract deployer, can be DAO-governed later) can pause critical DAO functions in case of emergencies.
 * 22. **resumeDAO()**:  DAO owner can resume DAO operations after an emergency pause.
 * 23. **transferDAOOwnership(address _newOwner)**: Allows the current DAO owner to propose and transfer contract ownership to a new address through a DAO vote, enabling decentralized ownership transition.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Trendy Features:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** The core structure is a DAO, meaning governance and decision-making are distributed among token holders (members).

2.  **Quadratic Voting for Project Proposals:**  `voteOnProjectProposal()` implements quadratic voting. This is a more advanced voting mechanism designed to make it more costly for a few large token holders to dominate voting, while still allowing for proportional influence.  The cost of votes increases quadratically (votes * votes), making it expensive to cast a disproportionately large number of votes.

3.  **Reputation System:**  The contract includes a basic reputation system (`memberReputation`, `rewardReputation`, `penalizeReputation`).  Reputation can be used to weight voting power, grant special privileges, or incentivize positive community behavior. In this example, reputation is earned for funding projects and completing milestones, and penalized for project cancellation.

4.  **Voting Delegation:** `delegateVotingPower()` allows members to delegate their voting rights to other members. This enables more active participation and allows members to entrust their voting power to subject matter experts or trusted individuals.

5.  **Voting Power Boost (Staking for Boost):** `stakeTokensForBoost()` and `withdrawStakedBoost()` introduce a temporary voting power boost mechanism. Members can stake additional tokens for a limited time to increase their voting influence, incentivizing token locking and potentially more active participation during critical votes.

6.  **Governance Parameter Setting through Proposals:**  Governance parameters like quorums, voting durations, and even membership stake amounts are not fixed.  They are managed through governance proposals (`proposeGovernanceChange()`, `voteOnGovernanceProposal()`, `setGovernanceParameter()`), making the DAO adaptable and community-governed.

7.  **Emergency Pause and DAO Ownership Transfer:** `emergencyPauseDAO()` and `transferDAOOwnership()` functions provide mechanisms for handling critical situations and transitioning DAO ownership in a decentralized way.  The ownership transfer is also DAO-governed, ensuring it's not unilaterally controlled by the initial contract deployer in the long term.

8.  **Milestone-Based Project Funding:** Projects are funded based on milestones (`requestMilestoneCompletion()`, `voteOnMilestoneCompletion()`, `releaseMilestoneFunds()`). This ensures accountability and gradual fund release based on project progress, protecting funders and incentivizing creators to deliver.

9.  **Clear Event Logging:** The contract uses events extensively to log important actions (membership changes, proposals, voting, funding, etc.). This makes it easier to track DAO activity and build user interfaces that reflect the DAO's state.

**Important Notes:**

*   **ERC20 Dependency:** This contract assumes you have a basic ERC20 token contract (`ERC20.sol`). In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a robust and audited ERC20 implementation like OpenZeppelin's ERC20.
*   **Security and Audits:** This is a complex smart contract example. **For production use, it is crucial to have it thoroughly audited by security professionals.**  There might be vulnerabilities or areas for optimization that would be identified in a professional audit.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Gas optimization is not the primary focus here, but in a real application, you'd want to carefully consider gas costs and optimize functions for efficiency.
*   **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**  While basic `require` statements are used, more robust error handling and handling of edge cases would be needed in a production-ready contract.
*   **Complexity:**  This contract is intentionally complex to demonstrate advanced concepts. For simpler DAOs, you might not need all these features. Choose features based on your specific DAO's needs and goals.
*   **Milestone Structure:**  The `milestones` in `ProjectProposal` are currently just a string. In a real application, you would want a more structured way to define milestones (e.g., an array of milestone objects with descriptions, funding amounts per milestone, etc.).
*   **Array Removal (Membership Revocation):**  Removing elements from Solidity arrays can be gas-intensive and complex. The `revokeMembership()` function in this example simplifies the removal process for demonstration purposes. In a real application, you might need more efficient array management techniques if frequent membership revocation is expected.
*   **Voting Power Calculation:** The `getVotingPower()` function demonstrates a recursive delegation. Be mindful of potential gas limits if delegation chains become very deep. Iterative approaches or limiting delegation depth might be needed for very large DAOs.

This detailed example provides a solid foundation for building a sophisticated and trendy DAO for creative projects. Remember to adapt and expand upon it based on your specific requirements and always prioritize security and thorough testing.
