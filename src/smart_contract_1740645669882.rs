/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Development & Ownership (AI-DAO)
 * @author Bard (OpenAI)
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO focused on developing and managing AI models.  It allows members to propose, vote on, and fund AI model development proposals.  A key feature is the fractionalized NFT ownership of the developed AI model, granting ownership to DAO members based on their contribution and token holdings.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Core DAO Functionality:**  Standard DAO mechanisms for proposals, voting, and token management.
 * 2. **AI Model Proposal Management:** Specific structures and functions for AI model development proposals, including budget, milestones, and technical details.
 * 3. **AI Model NFT Representation:** Upon successful development, the AI model is represented by a fractionalized NFT (using ERC1155).
 * 4. **Revenue Sharing:**  Revenue generated by the AI model (e.g., usage fees) is distributed proportionally to NFT holders.
 * 5. **AI Model Upgrade/Maintenance:**  Proposals can be made to upgrade, maintain, or modify the AI model.
 * 6. **Oracle Integration (Potential Future Enhancement):**  Interface to an oracle to bring real-world data into the smart contract for AI model training or validation.  (Not implemented in this base version, but included as a placeholder for future integration).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _votingPeriod, uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Initializes the DAO with token name, symbol, voting period, and quorum.
 * - `createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256 _budget, address _modelDeveloper, string memory _technicalDetails, Milestone[] memory _milestones)`: Creates a new AI model development proposal.
 * - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`:  Allows members to vote on a proposal.
 * - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes the voting threshold.
 * - `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Mints new governance tokens (restricted to the DAO creator).
 * - `transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Transfers governance tokens.
 * - `balanceOf(address _account)`: Returns the token balance of an account.
 * - `getProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details about a specific proposal.
 * - `getNFTBalance(address _account, uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the balance of AI Model NFTs owned by an account.
 * - `claimRevenue(uint256 _tokenId)`: Claims accumulated revenue for AI Model NFT holders.
 * - `fundModel(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows members to contribute funds to a approved AI Model.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Fractionalized NFT Ownership:** The DAO issues fractionalized NFTs (using the ERC1155 standard) upon successful AI model development.  This allows ownership of the AI model to be distributed proportionally to DAO members based on their token holdings or contribution to the proposal funding.
* **Revenue Sharing:**  The contract includes a mechanism for revenue sharing from the AI model.  Revenue can be generated through various means (e.g., API usage fees, model licensing). This revenue is distributed proportionally to the NFT holders.  This encourages DAO participation, as it allows token holders to directly benefit from the success of the developed AI models.
* **AI Model Upgrade/Maintenance:**  The contract allows proposals to be made for upgrading or maintaining the AI models. This ensures that the AI models remain relevant and effective over time.
* **Proposal Funding**: Added `fundModel` function allows users to directly contribute to a chosen proposal.  Tracks funding and marks `fundingComplete` when the goal is reached.  This allows the DAO to have funding from external sources, and a process of funding from the DAO members.
* **`receive()` function:** The `receive()` function has been added to allow the contract to receive ETH for funding purposes.
* **`totalRevenuePerNFT` & `unclaimedRevenue` Mappings**: Tracks the total revenue associated with an NFT and unclaimed revenue for each address, allowing revenue sharing to be implemented correctly. Prevents users from claiming twice.
* **`totalSupply(uint256 id)`**: The IERC1155 interface now includes `totalSupply(uint256 id)`, enabling revenue calculation to take total supply into account.
* **Error Handling**: Includes `require` statements throughout to check for invalid states and prevent errors.
* **Clearer Comments**:  The code is more extensively commented to explain the purpose of each function and section.
* **OnlyOwner Modifier**: Added security to ensure that the DAO owner controls sensitive operations.
* **Events**:  Events are emitted to track important actions, making it easier to monitor and audit the DAO's activities.
* **Security Considerations**:
    * **Reentrancy Attacks:**  The `transfer` function within the `claimRevenue` function could potentially be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. Consider implementing a reentrancy guard pattern to prevent this.  (OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` is a good option.)
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** Using Solidity 0.8.0 or later, the compiler includes built-in overflow/underflow protection. However, in earlier versions, you would need to use SafeMath libraries.
    * **Front-Running**: Voting and proposal execution can be susceptible to front-running.  Consider implementing mechanisms to mitigate this risk, such as using commit-reveal schemes or delaying proposal execution.
* **Important Notes:**
    * **External Calls:**  Be extremely careful when making external calls to other contracts.  Always validate the responses and handle potential errors.
    * **Gas Limits:**  Be mindful of gas limits, especially when dealing with complex operations or large datasets. Optimize your code to minimize gas consumption.
    * **Security Audits:** Before deploying any smart contract to a live network, it's crucial to have it thoroughly audited by a reputable security firm.

This comprehensive approach creates a more robust and feature-rich DAO specifically designed for AI model development and management. Remember that this is a simplified example and would require further development and testing before being deployed to a production environment.
