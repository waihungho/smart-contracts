/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation and Staking for Content Curation
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a reputation system based on staking and voting for content.
 *  Users stake tokens to gain reputation, allowing them to vote on content.
 *  Good curation is rewarded with a portion of the stakers' stake of poorly rated content.
 *  This encourages accurate and fair rating of content.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  Token Staking for Reputation:  Users stake a specified token to gain reputation (stakingPower).  More staked tokens = higher reputation.
 *  2.  Content Submission: Anyone can submit content (e.g., a URI or CID).
 *  3.  Voting on Content:  Reputation-weighted voting allows users to upvote or downvote content.
 *  4.  Stake-Based Rewards and Penalties:  Content reaching a positive/negative threshold triggers rewards and penalties.
 *      -  Correct voters on popular content earn a fraction of the stake of stakers on unpopular content
 *      -  Incorrect voters on unpopular content lose a portion of their stake.
 *  5.  Reputation Decay: Reputation gradually decays over time to maintain activity and prevent stagnant influence.
 *  6.  Content Removal: Allows content creators to remove content if needed (e.g., if it becomes outdated or irrelevant).
 *
 *  Function Summary:
 *  - constructor(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _decayRate, uint256 _minStake): Initializes the contract with the token address, decay rate, and minimum stake.
 *  - stake(uint256 _amount): Stakes tokens to gain reputation.
 *  - unstake(uint256 _amount): Unstakes tokens, reducing reputation.
 *  - submitContent(string memory _contentURI): Submits content for curation.
 *  - vote(uint256 _contentId, bool _isUpvote): Votes on content (upvote or downvote).
 *  - removeContent(uint256 _contentId): Allows content creator to remove content.
 *  - getContent(uint256 _contentId): Retrieves content details.
 *  - getUserStake(address _user): Returns the staked amount for a given user.
 *  - getUserReputation(address _user): Returns the reputation of a given user.
 *  - calculateReputation(uint256 _stakedAmount): Calculates reputation based on staked amount.
 *

}
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Reputation Decay:**  Implemented a `decayRate` parameter to slowly reduce reputation over time.  This encourages ongoing activity.  The `getUserReputation` function now includes this decay.
* **Content Removal:**  Added `removeContent` function allowing content creators to remove their content.
* **`active` Flag:**  Added an `active` flag to the `Content` struct.  This allows content to be "removed" without actually deleting it from storage, preserving vote data.
* **Rewards and Penalties:** The key improvement is the `distributeRewards` function, which distributes rewards and penalties based on vote outcomes.  This version:
    * **Collects Penalties:**  Takes a small percentage of the stake from users who voted *incorrectly* (upvoted bad content or downvoted good content).
    * **Distributes Rewards:**  Gives a small percentage of the `rewardPool` (collected from penalties) to users who voted *correctly*.  This incentivizes thoughtful voting.  Rewards and Penalties are emitted as events.
* **Clearer Voting Logic:**  `vote` function requires a minimum stake to prevent spam.
* **`checkThreshold` function:** Separated threshold checking into its own internal function for better organization.
* **Events:**  Emits events for content submission, voting, reputation decay, rewards, penalties, and content removal.  These events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and UI updates.
* **Simplified IERC20:** Using a simplified interface avoids unnecessary dependencies.
* **`sqrt` function:**  Included a basic square root function for reputation calculation.  A more precise library could be used for production.  The `calculateReputation` is now `public view` so it can be easily viewed.
* **Minimum Stake:**  Includes a `minStake` requirement to prevent very small stake amounts from diluting voting power.
* **Comments and Documentation:** Thoroughly commented throughout.
* **`active` check in `vote`:** Prevents voting on inactive content.
* **Content Creation/Iteration:** Includes an auto-incrementing `contentCount`.
* **Hard Coded Rewards:**  The percent taken in reward and given as a reward (1%) is hardcoded, but could easily be passed in via constructor if needed.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy the ERC20 Token:** First, deploy an ERC20 token contract (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation).
2.  **Deploy `CurationPlatform`:**  Deploy the `CurationPlatform` contract, providing the ERC20 token's address, decay rate, and minimum stake amount as constructor parameters.
3.  **Approve Spending:**  Users need to approve the `CurationPlatform` contract to spend their ERC20 tokens *before* calling `stake()`.  Do this using the ERC20 `approve()` function.
4.  **Stake Tokens:**  Call the `stake()` function to stake tokens and gain reputation.
5.  **Submit Content:** Call the `submitContent()` function to submit content.
6.  **Vote on Content:** Call the `vote()` function to upvote or downvote content.
7.  **Collect Rewards/Penalties:**  Rewards and penalties are distributed automatically when a content item reaches the vote thresholds.
8.  **Unstake Tokens:** Call the `unstake()` function to unstake tokens and reduce reputation.
9.  **Remove Content:**  Call the `removeContent` function to remove content.

This improved version provides a solid foundation for a decentralized content curation platform. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Also, consider the gas costs of each operation and optimize accordingly.
