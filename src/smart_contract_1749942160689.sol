Okay, let's design a smart contract that acts as a complex, state-dependent vault inspired by concepts like Quantum States, Flux, and Observation. It will manage multiple asset types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) and feature dynamic rules for withdrawals based on internal "Phase" and "Flux" variables, potentially influenced by user interaction and an 'Observer' role.

This avoids simple token standards or basic DeFi patterns, focusing on complex state transitions and conditional logic applied to asset management.

## Smart Contract Outline: QuantumFluxVault

**Concept:** A multi-asset vault where deposit and withdrawal mechanics are governed by internal state variables ("Phase", "Flux") that change over time, potentially influenced by external input (simulated via admin/oracle updates) and user interactions. Includes roles for admin, users, and a special 'Observer'.

**Core Features:**
1.  **Multi-Asset Support:** Handles ETH, various ERC20s, and various ERC721s.
2.  **Dynamic State:** The vault operates in distinct `Phase`s (e.g., Stable, Volatile, Restricted).
3.  **Quantum Flux:** A numerical value representing volatility or state sensitivity. Affects withdrawal conditions and fees. Updated periodically.
4.  **State-Dependent Withdrawals:** Users can only withdraw assets if the current `Phase` and `Flux` meet specific criteria.
5.  **User Interaction:** Users can *predict* the direction of the next flux change for rewards or attempt to *influence* the flux at a cost.
6.  **Observer Role:** A designated role can perform actions to 'stabilize' the flux under certain conditions, potentially at a cost (simulating active participation in state management).
7.  **Configurability:** Admin can configure phase rules, flux thresholds, rewards, costs, etc.
8.  **Emergency Measures:** Admin retains limited emergency control.

**Roles:**
*   **Owner (Admin):** Full control over configuration, phase changes, flux updates, emergency actions.
*   **User:** Deposit assets, attempt withdrawals, make predictions, influence flux.
*   **Observer:** A special role that can perform stabilization actions.

**Function Summary (28 functions):**

**I. Core Vault Operations:**
1.  `depositEth()`: User deposits ETH into the vault.
2.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: User deposits a specific ERC20 token. Requires prior approval.
3.  `depositERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: User deposits a specific ERC721 token. Requires prior approval or safe transfer.
4.  `withdrawEth(uint256 amount)`: User attempts to withdraw ETH, subject to current `Phase` and `Flux` conditions.
5.  `withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: User attempts to withdraw ERC20, subject to conditions.
6.  `withdrawERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: User attempts to withdraw ERC721, subject to conditions.

**II. State Query & Check:**
7.  `getUserEthBalance(address user)`: Get user's current ETH balance in the vault.
8.  `getUserERC20Balance(address user, address token)`: Get user's current ERC20 balance for a specific token.
9.  `getUserERC721Tokens(address user, address token)`: Get list of ERC721 token IDs owned by user in the vault.
10. `getVaultTotalEth()`: Get total ETH held in the vault.
11. `getVaultTotalERC20(address token)`: Get total amount of a specific ERC20 in the vault.
12. `getVaultTotalERC721(address token)`: Get total count of a specific ERC721 type in the vault.
13. `getVaultCurrentPhase()`: Get the current operating phase of the vault.
14. `getVaultCurrentFlux()`: Get the current flux level.
15. `checkWithdrawalEligibility(address user, uint256 amount)`: *View* function for user to check if ETH withdrawal is currently possible based on phase/flux/user state. (Overloaded for ERC20/ERC721 checks implicitly or could add separate views).

**III. Quantum/State Logic & Interaction:**
16. `triggerPhaseShift(Phase newPhase)`: Admin/Owner function to change the vault's operating phase.
17. `updateFluxLevel(uint256 newFlux)`: Admin/Owner function (simulating oracle/external input) to update the quantum flux level.
18. `predictFluxChange(bool predictsIncrease)`: User makes a prediction whether the *next* flux update will be higher than the current.
19. `claimPredictionReward()`: User claims reward if their last prediction was correct after a flux update.
20. `influenceFlux()`: User pays a fee (e.g., ETH) to add a *minor* probabilistic bias towards a specific flux outcome on the *next* update. (Effect applied during `updateFluxLevel`).
21. `setObserverRole(address observer, bool active)`: Admin/Owner grants or revokes the Observer role.
22. `observeAndStabilize()`: Observer function. Under certain conditions (e.g., high flux), the observer can call this to spend gas and slightly reduce the flux level, up to a certain limit per observer/block.

**IV. Configuration (Owner Only):**
23. `setFluxThresholds(uint256 stableMax, uint256 volatileMax)`: Set flux thresholds for different states.
24. `setPhaseConfig(Phase phase, bool withdrawalsEnabled, uint256 minFlux, uint256 maxFlux, uint256 withdrawalFeeBps)`: Configure rules for a specific phase.
25. `setPredictionRewardAmount(uint256 amount)`: Set the ETH reward for correct flux predictions.
26. `setInfluenceFluxCost(uint256 cost)`: Set the ETH cost to influence the flux.
27. `addAllowedToken(address token, bool isERC721)`: Admin allows a new ERC20 or ERC721 token type for deposits.
28. `removeAllowedToken(address token)`: Admin disallows a token type (careful: does not handle existing balances).

**V. Emergency/Admin Utility:**
*   (Implicit, standard Ownable functions: `renounceOwnership`, `transferOwnership`)
*   (Could add emergency withdraws for stuck tokens)

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Complexity:** Handles ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 within a single vault, each with potentially different withdrawal fees or logic implications (e.g., ERC721 fee taken in ETH).
2.  **Dynamic State (`Phase` & `Flux`):** The core idea isn't just holding assets but managing *access* based on internal, fluctuating state variables (`currentPhase`, `currentFlux`). This creates uncertainty and strategic considerations for users.
3.  **State-Dependent Access Control:** Withdrawal functions (`withdrawEth`, `withdrawERC20`, `withdrawERC721`) are not simply balance checks. They depend on the complex interplay of `currentPhase`, `currentFlux`, and the configured `phaseConfigs` (min/max flux requirements, enabled flags).
4.  **Simulated External Input (`updateFluxLevel`):** The `updateFluxLevel` function simulates receiving data from an external source (like an oracle or a decentralized random beacon, though simplified here by being admin-triggered and using blockhash). This introduces unpredictability into the vault's state.
5.  **User Interaction & Game Theory (`predictFluxChange`, `claimPredictionReward`, `influenceFlux`):**
    *   Users can try to *predict* the outcome of the next flux update, adding a prediction market element.
    *   Correct predictions are rewarded, creating an incentive structure tied to observing and anticipating state changes.
    *   Users can *influence* the flux by paying ETH, adding a cost-based interaction that slightly biases the pseudo-random outcome. This is a unique mechanic where users "pay" to nudge the system state.
6.  **Observer Role (`observeAndStabilize`):** A special role exists specifically to interact with the state. Observers can spend ETH to "stabilize" high flux, potentially benefiting themselves or other users by making withdrawals possible again. This adds a distinct actor type with a specific function within the system's state management.
7.  **Configurability:** Extensive configuration options (`setFluxThresholds`, `setPhaseConfig`, etc.) allow the owner to define complex state transition rules and parameters, enabling intricate game-like dynamics or risk management profiles.
8.  **ERC721 Handling:** Proper implementation of `ERC721Holder` and handling lists of token IDs per user adds complexity beyond simple fungible tokens. The fee structure for ERC721 withdrawals (taken from ETH balance) is also a specific design choice.
9.  **Avoids Standard Patterns:** It's not a simple ERC20 minter, a standard NFT marketplace, a basic staking contract, or a typical multi-sig. It combines asset holding with a custom, dynamic state machine.

This contract provides a framework for complex, state-driven asset management, offering more intricate interactions and strategic considerations than typical vault contracts. The "Quantum" theme is used metaphorically to justify the unpredictable/state-dependent nature of the vault's mechanics.
