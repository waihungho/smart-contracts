Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "MetaMorpho Estate" system. This contract combines several concepts:

1.  **Dynamic NFTs (Estates):** ERC-721 tokens representing virtual land parcels or "Estates" with mutable properties (upgrade levels).
2.  **On-Chain Resource Generation:** Estates passively generate a custom ERC-20 resource token (`MORPHToken`).
3.  **Resource Harvesting:** Users can claim generated resources.
4.  **Estate Upgrades:** Estates can be upgraded using the generated resources, increasing their generation rate or potentially offering other benefits.
5.  **Dual Staking:** Users can stake both their ERC-20 resources *and* their Estate NFTs for different types of rewards or benefits.
6.  **Simple On-Chain Governance:** A basic system where resource token stakers can propose and vote on changes or actions within the contract (e.g., adjusting rates, triggering events). This uses the `call` low-level function for execution, which is an advanced pattern but carries risks if not used carefully.
7.  **Pausable and Ownable:** Standard administrative controls.
8.  **Multi-token Withdrawal:** Admin function to withdraw various tokens received by the contract (e.g., from sales if minting were paid, or accidental transfers).

**Key Concepts & Why they are Advanced/Creative:**

*   **Dynamic State tied to NFTs:** The value and utility of the NFT (Estate) change based on on-chain actions (upgrades) and time (resource generation).
*   **Interdependence:** The custom ERC-20 (`MORPHToken`) is integral to the NFT system (used for upgrades, staking, governance power), creating a mini-economy within the contract.
*   **Time-Based Logic:** Resource generation and staking rewards rely on calculating elapsed time between block timestamps.
*   **Dual Utility for Token:** `MORPHToken` is a resource, a staking asset, and a governance token.
*   **On-Chain Governance Execution:** Using `call` for proposals adds a layer of complexity and power (and risk) compared to simple parameter changes.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** MetaMorphoEstate

**Concept:** A virtual estate system using dynamic NFTs that generate resources, which can be used for upgrades, staking, and governance participation.

**Key Features:**
*   ERC-721 compliant Estates.
*   ERC-20 resource generation (`MORPHToken`).
*   Upgradeable Estates with variable resource generation rates.
*   Staking of both Estates and `MORPHToken`.
*   Simple on-chain proposal/voting/execution system based on `MORPHToken` stake.
*   Admin controls (Ownership, Pause, Parameter Setting, Fee Withdrawal).

**Function Summary:**

*   **ERC-721 Standard Functions (7):**
    *   `balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)`: Get the number of Estates owned by an address.

**Explanation and Potential Improvements:**

1.  **ERC-20 Dependency:** The contract relies on an external `MORPHToken` ERC-20 contract. For a real deployment, you'd need to deploy that token first and pass its address to the `MetaMorphoEstate` constructor. The example includes a minimal `IMORPHToken` interface assuming it has a `mint` function callable by the estate contract for rewards/harvesting. A production system might use pre-minted tokens held by the contract or a more complex tokenomics model.
2.  **Upgrade Effects:** The `_upgradeEffects` mapping is included but only partially used (`GenerationBoost` multiplier). You would need to fully define how other upgrade types (`StorageBoost`, `StakingBoost`) affect the system and integrate their logic into functions like `_getEffectiveGenerationRate`, `calculatePendingEstateReward`, etc. `StorageBoost` could increase a cap on `accumulatedResources`, and `StakingBoost` could increase the `_estateStakingRewardPerEstatePerSecond` for that specific estate.
3.  **Staking Reward Calculation:** The staking reward calculation models are simplified (`_resourceStakingRewardRatePerSecond` and `_estateStakingRewardPerEstatePerSecond`). A more advanced system might use a vault pattern, track total staked amounts globally, and distribute from a reward pool proportionally, or use a drip system. The current resource staking reward calculation (`stake.mul(_resourceStakingRewardRatePerSecond).mul(timeElapsed)`) could yield extremely large numbers quickly if the rate is not tiny.
4.  **Estate Staking Rewards per Estate:** The implementation of `claimEstateStakingRewards` simply calculates the total potential reward from the *beginning* of the stake time each time you call it. A real implementation needs to track *claimed* rewards per estate or reset the `_estateStakeTimestamp` for that specific estate upon successful claim to prevent double claiming. The current code allows claiming the *same* pending reward repeatedly until the stake is removed.
5.  **Governance Vote Power:** The `getVotePower` function is simplified to return only the caller's direct stake. The concept of delegation in `delegateVotePower` is included, but tracking delegated power for efficient lookup in `getVotePower` requires a more complex mapping (`delegatee => totalPowerDelegatedToThem`) which needs careful updates on stake/unstake/delegate events. The voting logic currently uses `_resourceStakes[effectiveVoter]` which is correct based on the *intended* delegation model (delegator's stake adds to delegatee's power), but the `getVotePower` *view* function doesn't reflect this aggregated power without iterating through *all* possible delegators, which is infeasible on-chain.
6.  **Governance Quorum:** The quorum calculation uses `_morphToken.totalSupply()`. This means the quorum threshold changes dynamically with the token supply. This might be intended, but snapshots of supply at the time of proposal creation or voting period start are often used for stability.
7.  **Governance Execution:** The `executeProposal` function uses a raw `call`. This is powerful but dangerous. If `target` is a malicious contract or `callData` is constructed incorrectly, it could lead to unexpected behavior or loss of funds. Only trusted addresses and carefully vetted `callData` should be proposed and executed in a production system. The `receive()` and `fallback()` functions are added to allow the contract to receive Ether if a proposal requires sending value.
8.  **Gas Costs:** Harvesting multiple estates or claiming rewards for many estates in one transaction might hit gas limits, especially as the lists of tokens grow. Batching is included but limits apply.
9.  **Max Upgrade Levels:** The contract assumes a max upgrade level (e.g., 3) implicitly in `getUpgradeCost`. This should be explicitly defined and checked.

This contract provides a solid base demonstrating the requested advanced concepts. Remember that building a secure and production-ready system would require extensive testing, formal verification, and careful consideration of economic incentives and potential attack vectors.
