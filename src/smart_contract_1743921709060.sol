 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit, curate,
 *      and monetize digital art, governed by community voting and incorporating advanced features like

 * **Functions:**
 * **Artist & Artwork Management:**
 *   1. `registerArtist(string memory _name, string memory _bio)`: Allows artists to register with the collective.
 *   2. `submitArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Artists submit their artwork for curation.
 *   3. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId) view returns (Artwork memory)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork.
 *   4. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId) payable`: Allows users to purchase curated artworks.
 *   5. `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price) onlyArtist`: Allows artists to set the price of their curated artworks.
 *   6. `withdrawArtistEarnings() onlyArtist`: Allows artists to withdraw their earnings from artwork sales.

 * **Curation & Governance:**
 *   7. `registerCurator()`: Allows community members to register as curators (potentially requiring a stake/approval).
 *   8. `submitCurationProposal(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Curators propose to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 *   9. `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _voteChoice)`: Registered curators can vote on curation proposals.

 *   11. `submitPlatformFeeChangeProposal(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Curators propose a change to the platform fee.
 *   12. `executePlatformFeeChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyAdmin`: Admin executes platform fee change proposals.
 *   13. `submitDynamicRoyaltyCurveProposal(DynamicRoyaltyTier[] memory _newCurve)`: Curators propose changes to the dynamic royalty curve.
 *   14. `executeDynamicRoyaltyCurveProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyAdmin`: Admin executes dynamic royalty curve change proposals.
 *   15. `submitGenerativeArtModuleProposal(address _newModuleAddress)`: Curators propose to update the generative art module address.
 *   16. `executeGenerativeArtModuleProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyAdmin`: Admin executes generative art module address change proposals.
 *   17. `submitCommunityTokenProposal(address _newTokenAddress)`: Curators propose to set or change the community token contract address.
 *   18. `executeCommunityTokenProposal(uint256 _proposalId) onlyAdmin`: Admin executes community token contract address change proposals.

 * **Generative Art Integration (Placeholder - Conceptual):**
 *   39. `triggerGenerativeArt(uint256 _artworkId) onlyGenerativeArtModule`:  (Conceptual) External generative art module can trigger an update/generation for an artwork.
 *   40. `getGenerativeArtOutput(uint256 _artworkId) view returns (string memory)`: (Conceptual) Retrieve the IPFS hash of the generated artwork output.
