Okay, let's create a smart contract concept around a decentralized, time-ordered, and community-curated historical record or narrative â€“ a "Crypto Chronicle". Users can contribute entries, which are tokenized (as NFTs). The contract also features a native utility token used for participation, curation (voting), and potential rewards (staking).

Here's a contract that combines ERC-721 (for entries), basic ERC-20 interaction (via an interface for the native token), time-based indexing, linked entries, community voting, and staking.

---

**Outline and Function Summary:**

1.  **Contract Description:**
    *   A decentralized platform for creating a time-ordered, linked series of "Chronicle Entries".
    *   Entries are unique NFTs (ERC721).
    *   Uses an external ERC20 token (`ChronToken`) for participation fees, staking, and voting.
    *   Features include entry creation, timeline browsing, linking entries, community voting on entry significance, and staking $CHRON tokens.

2.  **Interfaces:**
    *   `IERC721` and `IERC721Enumerable` (from OpenZeppelin for NFT standard functions).
    *   `IERC20` (from OpenZeppelin for token standard functions).
    *   `IChronToken` (custom interface for the specific ChronToken methods used).

3.  **Libraries:**
    *   `Counters` (from OpenZeppelin for managing unique IDs).
    *   `SafeERC20` (from OpenZeppelin for safer token interactions).
    *   `Ownable` (from OpenZeppelin for contract ownership).

4.  **Data Structures:**
    *   `Entry`: Struct to hold details of each chronicle entry (creator, timestamp, content, links, significance score, reactions, etc.).
    *   `ReactionType`: Enum for different types of reactions.

5.  **State Variables:**
    *   `_chronToken`: Address of the associated ChronToken ERC20 contract.
    *   `_entries`: Mapping from entry ID to `Entry` struct.
    *   `_entryIndexToId`: Array mapping timeline index to entry ID. Provides canonical order.
    *   `_authorEntries`: Mapping from author address to an array of entry IDs created by them.
    *   `_stakedAmounts`: Mapping from staker address to their staked $CHRON amount.
    *   `_entryCreationCost`: Cost in $CHRON to create an entry.
    *   `_lastEntryId`: Counter for unique entry IDs.
    *   `_lastEntryIndex`: Counter for the timeline index.
    *   Standard ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable state variables (`_owners`, `_balances`, `_approved`, `_operatorApprovals`, `_allTokens`, `_tokenByIndex`, `_tokenOfOwnerByIndex`).

6.  **Events:**
    *   `EntryCreated`: Emitted when a new entry is minted.
    *   `SignificanceVoted`: Emitted when an entry's significance score changes.
    *   `ReactionAdded`: Emitted when a reaction is added to an entry.
    *   `ChronTokenStaked`: Emitted when tokens are staked.
    *   `ChronTokenUnstaked`: Emitted when tokens are unstaked.
    *   `EntryCreationCostUpdated`: Emitted when the cost to create an entry changes.

7.  **Functions (Total: 31+ functions):**

    *   **ERC721 Standard (Overridden/Implemented):**
        1.  `balanceOf(address owner)`: Get NFT count for an owner.
        2.  `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`: Get owner of an NFT.
        3.  `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Safely transfer NFT.
        4.  `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data)`: Safely transfer NFT with data.
        5.  `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Transfer NFT.
        6.  `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`: Approve address to manage NFT.
        7.  `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`: Set operator approval for all NFTs.
        8.  `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`: Get approved address for an NFT.
        9.  `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`: Check operator approval.
        10. `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)`: ERC165 interface support check.
        11. `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Get metadata URI for an NFT.
        12. `tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index)`: Get token ID by owner index (Enumerable).
        13. `totalSupply()`: Get total number of entries (Enumerable).
        14. `tokenByIndex(uint256 index)`: Get token ID by global index (Enumerable).

    *   **Chronicle Entry Management:**
        15. `createChronicleEntry(string memory contentURI, uint256 previousEntryId)`: Mints a new entry NFT, pays fee in $CHRON, adds to timeline.
        16. `getEntryDetails(uint256 entryId)`: View details of a specific entry.
        17. `getTotalEntries()`: View total number of entries created.
        18. `getEntryByIndex(uint256 index)`: View entry ID at a specific timeline index.
        19. `getLatestEntryId()`: View the ID of the most recently created entry.
        20. `getPreviousEntryId(uint256 entryId)`: View the ID of the entry this one links to.
        21. `getEntriesByAuthor(address author)`: View all entry IDs created by an author.

    *   **Community & Curation (Using ChronToken):**
        22. `voteForSignificance(uint256 entryId, uint256 amount)`: Stake $CHRON to vote for an entry's significance. Higher stake = more voting power.
        23. `getEntrySignificanceScore(uint256 entryId)`: View the calculated significance score (e.g., total staked votes).
        24. `addReactionToEntry(uint256 entryId, ReactionType reaction)`: Add a specific reaction (e.g., like, insightful) to an entry. Requires a small $CHRON fee? (Let's make it free for simplicity in this version, but track reactions).
        25. `getEntryReactionCount(uint256 entryId, ReactionType reaction)`: View count for a specific reaction on an entry.

    *   **Staking ($CHRON):**
        26. `stakeChronToken(uint256 amount)`: Stake $CHRON tokens in the contract.
        27. `unstakeChronToken(uint256 amount)`: Unstake $CHRON tokens.
        28. `getStakedAmount(address staker)`: View user's staked amount.
        29. `claimStakingRewards()`: (Placeholder/Conceptual) Function to claim rewards. (Actual reward distribution logic can be complex; for this example, let's mention fees could be distributed here). *Refinement: Let's make staked amount influence voting power, and fees accumulate for withdrawal by owner, or simple proportional distribution to stakers.* Let's make fees distributable proportionally to stakers upon claiming.

    *   **Admin/Owner Functions (Ownable):**
        30. `setChronTokenAddress(address tokenAddress)`: Set the address of the official ChronToken contract. (Only callable once or by owner).
        31. `setEntryCreationCost(uint256 cost)`: Set the required $CHRON cost to create an entry.
        32. `withdrawFees()`: Owner can withdraw accumulated $CHRON from entry creation fees. *Refinement: Instead of owner withdrawal, let's distribute fees to stakers when they claim.* Update `claimStakingRewards` to handle this. Let's keep `withdrawFees` for *unclaimed* fees that might not fit the distribution model, or maybe for a separate treasury. Or remove it and strictly route fees to stakers. Let's remove `withdrawFees` and route *all* entry fees to the staking reward pool. `claimStakingRewards` will distribute from this pool.
        33. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfer contract ownership.

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **ERC721Enumerable Inheritance:** Provides standard NFT functionality (ownership, transfers, approvals) and adds enumeration (`totalSupply`, `tokenByIndex`, `tokenOfOwnerByIndex`), making it easy to list all NFTs or all NFTs owned by a specific address.
2.  **Time-Ordered Indexing (`_entryIndexToId` array):** This array explicitly stores entry IDs in the order they were created. This provides a canonical "timeline" or "history" aspect that is different from just querying NFTs by ID. `getEntryByIndex` allows navigating this timeline.
3.  **Linked Entries (`previousEntryId`):** Entries can optionally link to a previous entry, allowing users to build narratives or historical chains. `createChronicleEntry` enforces linking unless it's the very first entry.
4.  **External ERC20 Token (`IChronToken` and `_chronToken`):** The contract interacts with a separate ERC20 token for core mechanics. This is a common pattern for utility tokens, separating concerns from the main NFT/protocol logic. `SafeERC20` is used for safer token transfers.
5.  **Entry Creation Fee (`_entryCreationCost`):** Requires users to spend $CHRON to add an entry, providing a token sink and potentially preventing spam. The fee goes into a `_rewardPool`.
6.  **Community Significance Voting (`voteForSignificance`):** Users can stake their $CHRON tokens to vote for entries they deem significant. The staked amount directly adds to the entry's `significanceScore`. This links token holding/staking to content curation.
7.  **Staking (`stakeChronToken`, `unstakeChronToken`, `_stakedAmounts`, `_totalStaked`):** Users can stake $CHRON tokens in the contract. This pool of staked tokens is used for the significance voting weight and also makes stakers eligible for rewards.
8.  **Fee Distribution (Conceptual in `claimStakingRewards`):** Entry creation fees ($CHRON) are collected into a `_rewardPool`. The `getPendingRewards` and `claimStakingRewards` functions provide a *simplified* model where stakers can claim a proportional share of this pool based on their current stake relative to the total staked amount. A real-world implementation would require more sophisticated reward-debt tracking to be fully accurate across variable stake amounts and times.
9.  **Reactions (`addReactionToEntry`, `_entryReactions`):** Allows lightweight, on-chain "reactions" to entries, adding a social/engagement layer.
10. **Role-Based Access Control (`Ownable`):** Standard pattern where the deployer/owner has special permissions (like setting the token address and creation cost).
11. **Gas Considerations:** Adding to the `_entryIndexToId` array has an increasing gas cost over time as the array grows. For a system expecting millions of entries, alternative structures (like skipping the full on-chain array or using a Merkle proof-based off-chain index with on-chain root) might be necessary, but for a conceptual example, the array is clear and functional.

This contract provides a framework for a dynamic, community-driven historical ledger where participation is incentivized by a utility token and curated through staking-based voting, going beyond standard ERC721 or ERC20 implementations.
