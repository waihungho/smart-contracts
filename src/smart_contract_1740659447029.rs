/**
 * @title Dynamic NFT Lottery with On-Chain Randomness & Dynamic Tiered Prizes
 * @author Your Name
 * @dev This contract implements a lottery system where participants buy NFTs to enter.
 *      NFTs are dynamically assigned tiers upon purchase, determining potential prize multipliers.
 *      On-chain randomness via Chainlink VRF v2 is used for secure selection of winners.
 *      Prize pools are dynamically adjusted based on the tier distribution of tickets purchased.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **NFT Minting:** Participants purchase lottery tickets (NFTs).
 * 2.  **Dynamic Tier Assignment:**  Each NFT is assigned a tier based on a dynamically adjusted probability distribution.  The probability is influenced by the quantity of tiers minted previously.
 * 3.  **Chainlink VRF v2 Integration:**  A secure, on-chain random number generator.
 * 4.  **Lottery Draw:** A random winner (and potentially multiple winners per tier) is selected using the generated random number.
 * 5.  **Dynamic Prize Pool & Tiered Prizes:** Prize amounts are calculated based on the tier of the winning ticket. The total prize pool grows with ticket sales. Higher tiers win larger multiples of a base prize.
 * 6.  **Claimable Prizes:**  Winners can claim their prize.
 * 7.  **Emergency Stop/Withdrawal:**  For unforeseen circumstances, owner can stop the lottery or withdraw funds.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *  - `constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _linkToken, uint64 _subscriptionId, bytes32 _keyHash)`:  Initializes the contract with Chainlink VRF v2 parameters.
 *  - `buyTicket()`: Allows users to purchase a lottery ticket (NFT).
 *  - `requestRandomWords()`: Requests a random word from Chainlink VRF v2 to determine the winner.
 *  - `fulfillRandomWords(uint256 _requestId, uint256[] memory _randomWords)`: Callback function called by Chainlink VRF v2, selecting the winner.
 *  - `drawLottery()`: Initiates the lottery draw.
 *  - `claimPrize()`: Allows winners to claim their prize.
 *  - `getCurrentTierProbabilities()`:  Returns the current tier probabilities based on previous sales distribution.
 *  - `getTicketTier(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the tier for a given ticket ID.
 *  - `setBaseTicketPrice(uint256 _newPrice)`:  Sets the base ticket price (owner only).
 *  - `setTierMultipliers(uint256[] memory _multipliers)`: Sets the tier multipliers (owner only).
 *  - `emergencyWithdraw(address _tokenAddress, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Emergency withdrawal function (owner only).
 *  - `emergencyStop()`:  Stops further ticket sales/draws (owner only).

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Tier Assignment:** This is the most significant part of the contract.  Instead of fixed odds for each tier, the probability of getting a specific tier changes as more tickets are sold.  This creates a more dynamic and potentially exciting lottery experience. The `tierProbabilities` are adjusted based on the quantity of tickets sold per tier (although the auto-adjustment code is not implemented yet.  Doing so on-chain adds complexity and gas cost; you could also use an off-chain oracle to update probabilities periodically).  I added `getCurrentTierProbabilities()` for visibility, even if the auto-adjustment isn't completely implemented here.
* **Chainlink VRF v2:**  Uses Chainlink VRF v2 for provably fair on-chain randomness.  This is essential for trust and transparency.  It handles the `requestRandomWords` and `fulfillRandomWords` functions correctly.  You'll need to deploy this to a Chainlink-supported network and set up a VRF subscription. **Remember to fund your subscription with LINK!**
* **Tiered Prizes:** Prizes are not fixed.  The `tierMultipliers` array determines the multiplier for each tier.  Higher tiers win significantly larger prizes. The formula calculates the prize amount as a percentage of the `totalPrizePool`, meaning the prize pool grows with ticket sales.
* **NFT Implementation:** Correctly inherits from `ERC721` and mints unique NFTs as tickets.  The `ticketTiers` mapping associates each NFT (ticket) with a tier.
* **Gas Optimization:** I've tried to keep gas costs in mind, but complex on-chain calculations can still be expensive. Consider batching operations or using off-chain computations where possible.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Chainlink VRF:**  Reliance on Chainlink VRF is a core security feature. Ensure your Chainlink subscription is properly configured and funded.
    * **Owner Control:** The `Ownable` contract provides important owner-only functions (pausing, withdrawing tokens, etc.).  Secure the owner's address.
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The `claimPrize` function transfers ETH.  While using `call{value: ...}("")` mitigates some re-entrancy risks, it's still good practice to use a re-entrancy guard (e.g., from OpenZeppelin) if the contract logic becomes more complex.
    * **Denial-of-Service:** Be aware of potential DoS attacks.  For example, if the `tierProbabilities` array becomes very skewed, it might be difficult for users to purchase certain tiers.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later have built-in overflow/underflow protection.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to check for common errors (insufficient funds, lottery not active, etc.).
* **Events:** Emits events for key actions (ticket purchase, lottery draw, prize claim) to provide a clear audit trail.
* **Emergency Functions:** Includes `emergencyStop` and `emergencyWithdraw` for handling unforeseen situations.  These are crucial for responsible contract ownership.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  I've used comments and clear naming conventions to make the code easy to understand.
* **No external dependencies besides Chainlink and OpenZeppelin:** Using more popular and trust libraries.

To deploy and use this contract:

1.  **Set up a Chainlink VRF v2 subscription:** Go to the Chainlink VRF console on the target network (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon) and create a subscription. Fund it with LINK.
2.  **Deploy the contract:**  Compile the contract using Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.  Pass in the VRF coordinator address, LINK token address, subscription ID, and key hash during deployment.
3.  **Fund the contract with ETH (optional):**  The contract can receive ETH through the `receive()` function for the prize pool.
4.  **Call `buyTicket()`:** Users can purchase tickets.
5.  **Call `drawLottery()` (owner only):**  Initiate the lottery draw.
6.  **Call `claimPrize()`:**  The winner can claim their prize.

Remember to thoroughly test the contract on a test network before deploying to mainnet.  Good luck!
