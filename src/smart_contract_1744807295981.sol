/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author AI Solidity Generator
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) that allows members to collectively manage and showcase digital art (NFTs).
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `requestMembership(string memory artistStatement) external`: Allows users to request membership by submitting an artist statement.
 *    - `approveMembership(address applicant) external onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner (DAO admin) to approve membership applications.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address member) external onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner to revoke membership.
 *    - `isMember(address user) public view returns (bool)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `getMemberArtistStatement(address member) public view returns (string memory)`: Retrieves the artist statement of a member.
 *
 * **2. Art Submission & Management:**
 *    - `submitArt(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, string memory artDescription) external onlyMember`: Members can submit their NFT art to the collective.
 *    - `approveArt(uint256 artId) external onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner to approve submitted art for the collective gallery.
 *    - `rejectArt(uint256 artId, string memory rejectionReason) external onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner to reject submitted art with a reason.
 *    - `getArtDetails(uint256 artId) public view returns (tuple(address submitter, address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, string memory description, bool approved, string memory rejectionReason))`: Retrieves details of a submitted artwork.
 *    - `getApprovedArtCount() public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the count of approved artworks in the collective.
 *    - `getApprovedArtIds() public view returns (uint256[] memory)`: Returns an array of IDs of approved artworks.
 *
 * **3. Exhibition & Showcase Features:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string memory exhibitionName, string memory exhibitionDescription, uint256[] memory artIds) external onlyOwner`: Creates a new virtual exhibition with a name, description, and a curated list of art IDs.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 exhibitionId) public view returns (tuple(string name, string description, uint256[] artIds, bool isActive))`: Retrieves details of an exhibition.
 *    - `activateExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId) external onlyOwner`: Activates an exhibition to make it publicly viewable/accessible (conceptually).
 *    - `deactivateExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId) external onlyOwner`: Deactivates an exhibition.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitionIds() public view returns (uint256[] memory)`: Returns an array of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **4. Community & Interaction (Conceptual):**
 *    - `recordArtView(uint256 artId) external`: Allows anyone to "view" and record an art piece's view count (conceptual interaction).
 *    - `getArtViewCount(uint256 artId) public view returns (uint256)`: Returns the view count of an art piece.
 *    - `addCommentToArt(uint256 artId, string memory comment) external`: Allows anyone to add a comment to an art piece.
 *    - `getArtComments(uint256 artId) public view returns (string[] memory)`: Retrieves all comments for a given art piece.
 *
 * **5. Utility & Ownership:**
 *    - `pauseContract() external onlyOwner`: Pauses the contract, preventing most functions from being called.
 *    - `unpauseContract() external onlyOwner`: Unpauses the contract.
 *    - `isPaused() public view returns (bool)`: Checks if the contract is paused.
 *    - `transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner`: Allows the contract owner to transfer ownership.
 *    - `getOwner() public view returns (address)`: Returns the current owner of the contract.
