Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts without directly duplicating common open-source patterns.

We will create a `QuantumFluctuationAuction` contract. This contract auctions off a unique digital asset (represented by an ID, conceptually a dynamic NFT) where the final price and the exact fractional ownership percentage awarded to the winner are influenced by a verifiable random number requested at the end of the auction period. It also includes a basic fractional ownership tracking system and a simple governance mechanism for the asset among fractional holders.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Verifiable Randomness:** Using Chainlink VRF to introduce unpredictable, yet verifiable, outcomes.
2.  **Dynamic Asset:** The auctioned asset conceptually has mutable metadata/state managed partly through governance.
3.  **Fractional Ownership:** The auction winner receives a significant *fraction* of the asset, with the remainder held by the contract, enabling shared ownership logic.
4.  **Algorithmic Outcome:** The auction's final price and the winner's exact fractional share are determined by a formula incorporating the highest bid and the random number.
5.  **Basic On-chain Governance:** Fractional owners can propose and vote on changes related to the asset or contract parameters.
6.  **Two-Step Auction End:** Separating the randomness request from the outcome fulfillment to handle the asynchronous nature of VRF.

## QuantumFluctuationAuction: Smart Contract Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFluctuationAuction`

**Description:** A smart contract that facilitates an auction for a unique digital asset (represented by an ID). The auction incorporates Chainlink VRF to introduce a "quantum fluctuation" effect, where the final price paid by the winner and the exact fractional percentage of the asset they receive are algorithmically adjusted based on a verifiable random number generated at the end of the bidding period. The contract also tracks fractional ownership of the asset and includes a basic governance system allowing fractional owners to propose and vote on actions related to the asset or contract.

**Core Concepts:** Verifiable Randomness (Chainlink VRF), Dynamic Asset (conceptual), Fractional Ownership (internal tracking), Algorithmic Auction Outcome, On-chain Governance.

**Interfaces Used:** `IERC721` (conceptually, though actual transfer logic is simplified for this example focusing on fractional state), `LinkTokenInterface`, `VRFCoordinatorV2Interface`.

**Inherits:** `Ownable`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `VRFConsumerBaseV2`.

**Function Summary:**

**I. Auction Management (Core)**
1.  `startAuction`: Initiates a new auction for a specific asset ID.
2.  `placeBid`: Allows users to place bids, refunding previous lower bids.
3.  `withdrawBidAmount`: Allows users to withdraw their bid if they've been outbid or retracted (if retraction was enabled).
4.  `cancelAuction`: Allows the owner/admin to cancel an auction before randomness is requested.
5.  `endAuctionStep1_RequestRandomness`: Finalizes bidding, locks the auction, and requests a random number from Chainlink VRF. Only callable after auction duration expires.
6.  `fulfillRandomness`: Chainlink VRF callback function. Processes the random result, calculates the final price and fractional distribution, transfers asset fraction, and handles funds.
7.  `getAuctionState`: View function to retrieve the current state and details of an ongoing or past auction.
8.  `getCurrentHighestBid`: View function to get the current highest bid and bidder.
9.  `getBidderBid`: View function to get a specific bidder's current bid amount.

**II. Fractional Ownership & Asset State**
10. `mintFluctuatingAsset`: Owner/admin function to conceptually "mint" a new asset ID and initialize its fractional state (e.g., 100% owned by the contract initially).
11. `getFractionalBalance`: View function to check the fractional percentage of an asset ID held by a specific address.
12. `getTotalAssetFractions`: View function to get the total fractional units for an asset (e.g., 10000 for 100%).
13. `getAssetMetadata`: View function to retrieve the conceptual metadata/state of an asset ID.
14. `updateAssetMetadataAdmin`: Owner/admin function to update asset metadata directly (e.g., for initialization or emergencies).

**III. Governance**
15. `proposeAction`: Allows fractional owners (above a certain threshold) to propose an action related to the asset or contract.
16. `voteOnAction`: Allows fractional owners to cast votes on open proposals. Voting power is proportional to fractional ownership.
17. `delegateVote`: Allows fractional owners to delegate their voting power to another address.
18. `executeAction`: Executes a proposal that has met the required voting threshold and quorum.
19. `getProposalState`: View function to retrieve the state and details of a specific governance proposal.
20. `getVoterWeight`: View function to check the voting power of an address for a specific asset ID.

**IV. VRF Configuration & Utility**
21. `setVRFParameters`: Owner/admin function to configure Chainlink VRF parameters (coordinator, keyhash, sub ID, gas limit).
22. `withdrawProtocolFunds`: Owner/admin function to withdraw accumulated protocol funds (e.g., fees, remaining auction amounts).
23. `setAuctionDefaultParameters`: Owner/admin function to set default auction parameters (like bid increment, base winner fraction).
24. `getVRFParameters`: View function to retrieve the current VRF configuration.
25. `pauseContract`: Owner/admin function to pause critical contract operations (e.g., placing bids, proposing).
26. `unpauseContract`: Owner/admin function to unpause the contract.

**(Note: The implementation of `executeAction` will be a placeholder due to the complexity of arbitrary on-chain actions within a single example contract. The focus is on the proposal/voting mechanism.)**
