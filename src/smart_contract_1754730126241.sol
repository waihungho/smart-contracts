/**
 * @title CognitoNet
 * @dev A decentralized protocol for curating and validating knowledge packets using economic incentives,
 *      reputation, and verifiable off-chain AI recommendations.
 *
 * I. Contract Overview
 *    A. Name: CognitoNet
 *    B. Purpose: To establish a reliable, incentivized, and community-driven network for decentralized knowledge curation.
 *                Users contribute, endorse, and challenge "knowledge packets" (verifiable information).
 *                The system incorporates a non-transferable reputation mechanism, dynamic staking of a native token (COG),
 *                and a unique verifiable integration with an off-chain AI oracle to enhance content validation and
 *                reward accurate contributions.
 *    C. Core Concepts:
 *        1.  Knowledge Packets: On-chain representations of verifiable information. These are essentially content pointers
 *            (e.g., IPFS CIDs stored as hashes) with associated on-chain metadata URI and a dynamic status determined
 *            by network interactions.
 *        2.  Reputation System (`knowledgeScore`): A non-transferable score for each user, reflecting their reliability,
 *            accuracy in endorsements, success in challenges, and overall quality of contributions. This serves as a
 *            "Soul-Bound Token (SBT)-like" concept for on-chain identity and trust without being an ERC721 token itself.
 *        3.  Dynamic Staking: Users stake `COG` tokens to express conviction (endorse) or dispute validity (challenge)
 *            of content. Staking influences content status and directly impacts the staker's reputation.
 *        4.  Verifiable AI Oracle Integration: An authorized off-chain AI service can submit recommendations (e.g., quality
 *            scores or classifications) for knowledge packets. This is done via a commitment-reveal scheme, where the AI
 *            first submits a cryptographic hash of its recommendation, signed by its unique key. Later, the full data can
 *            be revealed and verified on-chain, providing accountability for the AI service through potential penalties
 *            for misrepresentation.
 *        5.  Epoch-Based Rewards: Network activity is segmented into epochs (time periods). At the end of each epoch,
 *            rewards from a protocol pool are distributed to users based on their successful contributions, accurate
 *            curation decisions, and overall positive impact within that epoch.
 *        6.  Decentralized Curation: The status of a knowledge packet (e.g., PENDING, VALIDATED, CHALLENGED, REJECTED)
 *            is dynamically determined by collective staking and voting by the community. AI recommendations act as an
 *            additional signal or initial filter.
 *
 * II. Key Data Structures
 *    A. `KnowledgePacket`: Stores core information (hash, URI, creator, status, stakes, active challenges) for a knowledge item.
 *    B. `PacketStatus`: An enum defining the various lifecycle states of a knowledge packet.
 *    C. `ChallengeStatus`: An enum defining the lifecycle states of a content challenge.
 *    D. `UserStats`: Tracks a user's global `knowledgeScore` (reputation) and epoch-specific reward entitlements.
 *    E. `Epoch`: Records global epoch parameters (start/end time, reward pool) and aggregates user contributions for the epoch.
 *    F. `AIRecommendation`: Stores the commitment (hashed recommendation, signature), state (revealed, verified, challenged)
 *       and relevant data for an AI's input for a specific packet.
 *
 * III. Function Summary (More than 20 functions)
 *    A. Content Submission & Curation:
 *        1. `submitKnowledgePacket(bytes32 _contentHash, string calldata _metadataURI, uint256 _initialStakeAmount)`:
 *           Registers a new knowledge packet on the network, requiring an initial stake from the creator.
 *        2. `updateKnowledgePacketMetadata(uint256 _packetId, string calldata _newMetadataURI)`:
 *           Allows the original creator (or potentially highly reputable users/DAO) to update the metadata URI of a packet.
 *        3. `endorseKnowledgePacket(uint256 _packetId, uint256 _stakeAmount)`:
 *           Enables users to signal their approval and stake COG tokens to endorse the validity or quality of a knowledge packet.
 *        4. `challengeKnowledgePacket(uint256 _packetId, uint256 _challengeStakeAmount)`:
 *           Allows users to initiate a formal challenge against a knowledge packet's validity, requiring a challenge stake.
 *        5. `castChallengeVote(uint256 _challengeId, bool _voteForChallenger)`:
 *           Enables users to cast their vote on an active content challenge, influencing its ultimate outcome.
 *        6. `finalizeChallenge(uint256 _challengeId)`:
 *           Settles a challenge once its voting period concludes, distributing staked funds and adjusting participant reputations.
 *        7. `withdrawStake(uint256 _packetId, uint256 _amount)`:
 *           Permits users to retrieve their staked tokens from a knowledge packet, provided the packet's status allows (e.g., finalized, no active challenges).
 *
 *    B. Reputation & User Management:
 *        8. `getUserReputation(address _user)`:
 *           Retrieves the current `knowledgeScore` (reputation) of a specified user.
 *
 *    C. Epoch & Reward System:
 *        9. `advanceEpoch()`:
 *           A permissionless function that transitions the network to the next epoch, automatically triggering the calculation
 *           and preparation of rewards for the just-completed epoch.
 *       10. `claimEpochRewards(uint256 _epochId)`:
 *           Allows users to claim their earned COG token rewards for a specific past epoch.
 *       11. `getEpochInfo(uint256 _epochId)`:
 *           Provides comprehensive details about a particular epoch, including its start/end times and total reward pool.
 *       12. `getPendingRewards(address _user)`:
 *           Calculates and returns an estimate of the rewards a user is likely to receive in the current or upcoming epoch, based on their contributions.
 *
 *    D. Verifiable AI Oracle Interaction:
 *       13. `submitAIRecommendationCommitment(uint256 _packetId, bytes32 _hashedRecommendation, uint256 _timestamp, bytes calldata _signature)`:
 *           An authorized AI oracle submits a `keccak256` hash of its recommendation for a knowledge packet, along with a timestamp
 *           and a cryptographic signature, committing to its judgment without immediate full disclosure.
 *       14. `revealAndVerifyAIRecommendation(uint256 _packetId, bytes calldata _fullRecommendationData, uint256 _timestamp, bytes calldata _signature)`:
 *           Allows the AI oracle (or any interested party for verification) to reveal the full recommendation data. The contract then
 *           verifies this data against the previously committed hash and the oracle's signature. Misrepresentation can lead to flags or penalties.
 *       15. `challengeAIRecommendation(uint256 _packetId, uint256 _stakeAmount)`:
 *           Enables users to formally challenge the validity or fairness of an AI's submitted recommendation for a packet,
 *           potentially initiating a dispute process (simplified here).
 *
 *    E. View Functions (Data Retrieval):
 *       16. `getKnowledgePacketDetails(uint256 _packetId)`:
 *           Returns all publicly available stored details for a given knowledge packet.
 *       17. `getPacketStatus(uint256 _packetId)`:
 *           Returns only the current `PacketStatus` (PENDING, VALIDATED, CHALLENGED, REJECTED) of a knowledge packet.
 *       18. `getTopNKnowledgePackets(uint256 _n)`:
 *           Provides a list of the top `_n` highly-endorsed or validated knowledge packets (based on recent IDs for simplicity).
 *       19. `getChallengeDetails(uint256 _challengeId)`:
 *           Retrieves detailed information about a specific content challenge, including votes and status.
 *       20. `getAIRecommendationDetails(uint256 _packetId)`:
 *           Returns the details of an AI recommendation commitment for a packet (hash, timestamp, revealed status, etc.).
 *
 *    F. Protocol Governance & Administration (Owner/DAO controlled):
 *       21. `setEpochDuration(uint256 _duration)`:
 *           Allows the contract owner to adjust the duration of each epoch in seconds.
 *       22. `setChallengePeriod(uint256 _duration)`:
 *           Allows the contract owner to configure the duration for the voting phase of a challenge in seconds.
 *       23. `setMinimumStake(uint256 _amount)`:
 *           Allows the contract owner to set the minimum required stake amount for various operations (submission, endorsement, challenge).
 *       24. `updateOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`:
 *           Enables the contract owner to change the authorized address for the AI oracle.
 *       25. `withdrawProtocolFees()`:
 *           Allows the contract owner to withdraw any accumulated protocol fees collected from network activities.
