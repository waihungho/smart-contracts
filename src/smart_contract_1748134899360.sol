Okay, here is a design for a complex and advanced smart contract. This contract, let's call it `QuantumFluxVault`, manages multiple ERC-20 tokens, incorporates dynamic fees, time-locked/conditional withdrawals, a staking mechanism for yield based on collected fees, and a delegated action system. It aims for advanced concepts like internal share price tracking (simplified), conditional logic, multi-role access control beyond just owner, and meta-transaction-like delegation.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex example for demonstration purposes. It includes advanced concepts but would require rigorous auditing, robust oracle integrations (simplified here), and careful consideration of edge cases for production use. The internal `sharePrice` mechanism is simplified and would need a more robust, potentially oracle-driven, implementation in a real-world scenario to reflect the true value of diverse assets.

        // *Correction*: The `distributeCollectedFees` function already specifies the `feeToken` (which acts as the reward token for that distribution).
        // The `_updateStakingRewards` should just run for the specific rewardToken being claimed or when stake changes.
        // It shouldn't iterate through all possible tokens here. The `claimStakingRewards` function will specify the token.
        // The modifier should pass the reward token. But modifier doesn't know which token the user wants to claim.
        // The modifier should update for ALL tokens that the user *might* have rewards in. Still requires iterating.

    // --- Internal Helper to get supported tokens array ---
    // Note: Iterating mapping keys is not directly possible. This is a common limitation.
    // To return a list of supported tokens, you typically need to store them in an array as well,
    // and manage that array alongside the mapping (add/remove from both).
    // For demonstration, we'll skip returning the list, but acknowledge the need if a view function
    // or internal logic needed to iterate supported tokens (like in _updateStakingRewards before).
    // As a workaround for _updateStakingRewards, one could require calling it per token.
    // Let's provide a basic array helper, assuming a maximum number or requiring manual list updates.
    // Better approach: Maintain an array `supportedTokenList` and update it.

     function getSupportedTokensArray() internal view returns (address[] memory) {
        // This is a hacky way to get keys from a mapping. In reality, you'd manage a list/array.
        // We cannot iterate mappings directly in Solidity.
        // This function is NOT efficient and might not get all tokens reliably depending on compiler/state.
        // A real contract would use an array. Let's just return an empty array or revert, or require manual input.
        // For the sake of the example needing it in _updateUserRewardDebt, let's simulate iterating over a fixed small list or require passing the list.
        // Let's return a hardcoded small array for testing purposes, NOT suitable for production.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vault:** The vault handles multiple ERC-20 tokens (`supportedTokens`, `tokenBalances`).
2.  **Global Share System (Simplified):** Users deposit tokens and receive `globalShares` representing a proportional claim on the *entire vault's assets*. This is tracked internally (`totalGlobalShares`, `userGlobalShares`). The `sharePrice` is a simplified internal representation of value per share.
3.  **Dynamic Fees:** A `withdrawalFeeRate` can be set dynamically by managers, applied to withdrawals.
4.  **Time-Locked Withdrawals:** A `withdrawalUnlockDuration` imposes a minimum time period after a user's last vault interaction before they can withdraw, encouraging longer-term holding.
5.  **Conditional Withdrawals:** Introduces additional criteria for withdrawal:
    *   **Reputation System Integration:** Uses a simulated `userReputation` score (set by managers/oracles) as a condition.
    *   **Oracle Simulation:** Includes a check based on a simulated oracle result (`userOracleConditionMet`), indicating how external data could influence actions.
6.  **Staking Mechanism with Fee Yield:** Users can stake their `globalShares` (`stakeGlobalShares`). Fees collected by the vault (which remain in `tokenBalances`) can be *allocated* (`allocateFeesForStaking`) by managers to increase a reward pool. The contract uses a standard reward-per-share accounting system (`rewardTokensPerShare`, `userRewardPerSharePaid`, `unclaimedRewards`) to allow stakers to claim their pro-rata share of these allocated fees (`claimStakingRewards`). This turns fees into yield for stakers.
7.  **Multi-Role Access Control:** Beyond the standard `Owner`, a `Manager` role is introduced (`managers` mapping, `onlyManager` modifier) with specific permissions (adding tokens, setting parameters, pausing).
8.  **Delegated Actions (Simplified):** Users can `approveDelegatedAction` allowing a `delegatee` (like a relayer, a DApp frontend, or another smart contract) to call *specific, whitelisted* functions (`isDelegateable`) on their behalf via `executeDelegatedAction`. This mimics aspects of meta-transactions or account abstraction, enabling third parties to pay gas or interact on behalf of users. The system uses `delegationApprovals` with a `validUntil` timestamp for security.
9.  **Comprehensive Events:** Includes numerous events to provide transparency and enable off-chain monitoring and indexing of vault activity.
10. **Pausable & ReentrancyGuard:** Uses standard OpenZeppelin contracts for pausing critical functions and preventing reentrancy attacks.
11. **Internal Accounting Logic:** Manages complex internal state like `tokenBalances`, `totalGlobalShares`, `userGlobalShares`, and the staking reward accounting mappings.

This contract combines several distinct functionalities (vaulting, staking, conditional logic, delegation) into a single system, going beyond typical simple deposit/withdraw contracts and incorporating patterns seen in more advanced DeFi protocols. The challenges around the `sharePrice` and the mapping iteration limitations highlighted in the thought process are common complexities in real-world Solidity development.
