 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling artists to collaborate,
 * curate, and monetize digital art in a community-driven manner. This contract incorporates advanced
 * concepts like dynamic governance, tiered membership, curated NFT minting, and on-chain royalties
 * distribution, aiming for a unique and innovative approach to decentralized art.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Membership & Governance:**
 *    - Tiered Membership System (Artist, Patron, Curator) with NFT access tokens.
 *    - Dynamic Governance based on staked tokens and reputation.
 *    - Proposal System for art submissions, curation, and collective decisions.
 *    - Voting mechanisms with different weighting based on membership tier and stake.
 *
 * 2. **Art Curation & NFT Minting:**
 *    - Art Submission process with metadata and content URI.
 *    - Decentralized Curation through community voting.
 *    - Curated NFT minting â€“ only approved art gets minted as NFTs.
 *    - Customizable NFT metadata and royalty settings.
 *
 * 3. **Revenue & Treasury Management:**
 *    - Treasury for collective funds from NFT sales and membership fees.
 *    - Revenue distribution to artists and the collective treasury based on predefined splits.
 *    - Transparent on-chain royalty management for secondary sales.
 *    - Staking rewards distribution from treasury.
 *
 * 4. **Advanced Features:**
 *    - Reputation system based on participation and positive contributions.
 *    - Dynamic parameters (voting durations, quorum) adjustable through governance.
 *    - On-chain dispute resolution mechanism (placeholder for advanced implementation).
 *    - Integration with decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave) for art assets.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * 1. `joinCollective(uint8 _membershipTier) payable`: Allows users to join the collective by minting a Membership NFT based on the chosen tier (Artist, Patron, Curator) and paying a membership fee.
 * 2. `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective and burn their Membership NFT, potentially with a partial refund (governed).
 * 3. `submitArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Artists can submit art proposals with metadata and IPFS hash for curation.
 * 4. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on art proposals; voting power is weighted by membership tier and staked tokens.
 * 5. `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Curators and above can create governance proposals to change contract parameters or execute collective actions.
 * 6. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members vote on governance proposals with weighted voting power.
 * 7. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful governance proposal, potentially changing contract state or calling other contracts.
 * 8. `mintCuratedNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: After successful art proposal and governance approval, mints the art piece as an NFT.
 * 9. `purchaseNFT(uint256 _nftId) payable`: Allows users to purchase curated NFTs from the collective.
 * 10. `transferNFT(uint256 _nftId, address _to)`: Standard NFT transfer function with royalty enforcement.
 * 11. `stakeTokens() payable`: Allows members to stake native tokens to increase their voting power and earn rewards.
 * 12. `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to unstake tokens.
 * 13. `claimStakingRewards()`: Allows members to claim accumulated staking rewards.
 * 14. `setNFTPrice(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows the collective (through governance) to set or adjust the price of an NFT.
 * 15. `setRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _newRoyalty)`: Allows the collective (through governance) to set or adjust the royalty percentage for an NFT.
 * 16. `withdrawTreasuryFunds(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the collective (through governance) to withdraw funds from the treasury for collective purposes.
 * 17. `getMembershipTier(address _member) view returns (uint8)`: Returns the membership tier of a given address.
 * 18. `getArtProposalState(uint256 _proposalId) view returns (ProposalState)`: Returns the current state of an art proposal.
 * 19. `getGovernanceProposalState(uint256 _proposalId) view returns (ProposalState)`: Returns the current state of a governance proposal.
 * 20. `getNFTInfo(uint256 _nftId) view returns (string memory title, string memory description, string memory ipfsHash, address artist, uint256 price, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`: Returns detailed information about a curated NFT.
 * 21. `getTotalStakedTokens() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the total amount of tokens staked in the collective.
 * 22. `getTreasuryBalance() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 * 23. `getMemberReputation(address _member) view returns (uint256)`: Returns the reputation score of a member (placeholder, could be expanded).
 * 24. `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Governance function to change the voting duration for proposals.
 * 25. `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Governance function to change the quorum percentage required for proposal approval.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The core idea is to create a community-driven art platform where artists can collaborate, and members can curate and benefit from digital art.

2.  **Tiered Membership with NFTs (Implicit):** While not explicitly minting ERC721 NFTs, the `membershipTiers` mapping acts as a form of on-chain membership and access control, similar to holding a membership NFT.  In a real application, you could expand this to mint actual ERC721 membership tokens for more advanced features and interoperability.

3.  **Dynamic Governance:** The contract implements a basic governance system where members can vote on art proposals and governance proposals. The voting is weighted based on membership tier and the amount of tokens staked, making governance more dynamic than simple one-person-one-vote systems.

4.  **Curated NFT Minting:**  Art pieces are not automatically minted. They must be submitted as proposals and voted on by the community. Only approved art is minted as NFTs, ensuring a level of curation and quality control within the collective.

5.  **On-Chain Royalties & Revenue Distribution:**  The contract handles primary and secondary NFT sales and distributes revenue automatically. Royalties from secondary sales are also collected into the treasury, providing ongoing funding for the collective.

6.  **Staking for Voting Power & Rewards:** Members can stake native tokens to increase their voting power in proposals and potentially earn staking rewards (simplified example provided). This incentivizes participation and long-term commitment to the collective.

7.  **Governance Proposals & Parameter Adjustments:** Curators and above can create governance proposals to modify contract parameters like voting duration, quorum percentage, NFT prices, and royalty rates. This allows the collective to adapt and evolve over time.

8.  **Treasury Management:** The contract has a treasury to manage funds collected from membership fees and NFT sales. Withdrawals from the treasury are controlled by governance, ensuring collective oversight of funds.

9.  **Reputation System (Placeholder):**  The `getMemberReputation` function is a placeholder for a more advanced reputation system. In a real-world scenario, reputation could be built based on participation in voting, successful art submissions, positive feedback from other members, etc., and could further influence governance power or access to features.

10. **Event Emission:** The contract uses numerous events to log important actions, making it easier to track activity and integrate with off-chain systems or user interfaces.

**Advanced Concepts & Potential Improvements (Beyond this Example):**

*   **ERC721/ERC1155 Integration:** Implement full ERC721 or ERC1155 standards for NFTs, providing more robust NFT functionality and compatibility with marketplaces.
*   **Decentralized Identity & Reputation:** Integrate with decentralized identity solutions and more sophisticated reputation systems.
*   **Advanced Governance Mechanisms:** Implement more complex governance models like quadratic voting, conviction voting, or delegation.
*   **DAO Framework Integration:**  Integrate with a more established DAO framework or library (e.g., Aragon, OpenZeppelin Governor) for a more feature-rich and secure governance system.
*   **On-Chain Dispute Resolution:** Develop a more comprehensive on-chain dispute resolution mechanism for handling disagreements within the collective (beyond just voting).
*   **Decentralized Storage Integration:**  More robust integration with IPFS, Arweave, or other decentralized storage solutions for persistent art asset storage and metadata management.
*   **Layer 2 Scaling Solutions:** Consider deploying on Layer 2 solutions to reduce gas costs and improve transaction speed for users, especially for frequent voting and interactions.
*   **Cross-Chain Functionality:** Explore cross-chain capabilities to expand the reach of the collective and interact with art ecosystems on different blockchains.
*   **Dynamic Royalties:** Implement dynamic royalty mechanisms that can adjust based on market conditions or artist preferences (governance controlled).
*   **Fractional NFT Ownership:**  Introduce fractional NFT ownership to allow shared ownership and governance of high-value art pieces within the collective.

This smart contract provides a foundation for a creative and advanced Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective. It leverages various blockchain concepts to empower artists and communities in the digital art space. Remember that this is a conceptual example, and a production-ready contract would require further development, security audits, and potentially integration with other decentralized services.
