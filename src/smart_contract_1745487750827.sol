Okay, let's design a smart contract based on an advanced concept â€“ a "Quantum Vault". The idea is a vault that can hold assets (ETH or ERC20 tokens) and release them based on various, potentially complex, conditions or "protocols," simulating multiple possible states or access paths. This goes beyond simple time locks or single conditions.

Here's the outline and function summary, followed by the Solidity code.

---

### Contract Outline: `QuantumVault`

This contract serves as a secure vault capable of holding Ether and ERC20 tokens. Funds deposited into the vault are locked and can only be released or utilized according to specific, predefined "Protocols." These protocols represent different conditions or sets of conditions that must be met for execution.

1.  **State Variables:**
    *   Mappings to store protocol configurations and states.
    *   Counters for unique protocol IDs.
    *   Vault balances (implicitly handled by contract balance and token balances).
    *   Admin settings (owner, fee recipient, fees).
    *   Pause state.
    *   Mocks for conditional logic (e.g., simulating oracle prices or external events).

2.  **Enums:**
    *   `ProtocolType`: Defines the different types of release/execution mechanisms (TimeLock, CommitReveal, MultiCondition, ConditionalSwap, Escrow, RecurringPayment, FutureState).
    *   `ProtocolStatus`: Tracks the lifecycle state of a protocol (Active, Completed, Cancelled, Failed, AwaitingReveal, Disputed, Approved).
    *   `ConditionType`: Defines types of conditions for MultiCondition protocols (Time, BlockNumber, ExternalSignal, BooleanFlag).

3.  **Structs:**
    *   `Protocol`: Stores common data for all protocols (type, status, beneficiary, token address, amount, allocated amount).
    *   `TimeLockProtocolDetails`: Specifics for TimeLock (unlock time).
    *   `CommitRevealProtocolDetails`: Specifics for CommitReveal (commitment hash, deadline, revealed secret, committer).
    *   `MultiConditionProtocolDetails`: Specifics for MultiCondition (list of condition types, values, and status of each condition).
    *   `ConditionalSwapProtocolDetails`: Specifics for ConditionalSwap (target token, target amount, price condition details, swap status).
    *   `EscrowProtocolDetails`: Specifics for Escrow (approver address, dispute end time, dispute status).
    *   `RecurringPaymentProtocolDetails`: Specifics for RecurringPayment (start time, interval, end time, total paid count).
    *   `FutureStateProtocolDetails`: Specifics for FutureState (target block number, block hash commitment - *note: checking future block hashes reliably on-chain is impossible without trusted parties/oracles, this is simplified for demonstration*).

4.  **Events:**
    *   `ProtocolCreated`: Log when a new protocol is defined.
    *   `ProtocolStatusUpdated`: Log when a protocol's status changes.
    *   `FundsDeposited`: Log ETH/token deposits.
    *   `ProtocolExecuted`: Log when a protocol successfully releases funds or performs an action.
    *   `SecretCommitted`: Log a commitment for CommitReveal.
    *   `SecretRevealedAndClaimed`: Log successful reveal and claim.
    *   `ConditionMet`: Log when a condition in a MultiCondition protocol is met.
    *   `EscrowApproved`: Log when an escrow is approved.
    *   `EscrowDisputed`: Log when an escrow is disputed.
    *   `RecurringPaymentExecuted`: Log a successful recurring payment.
    *   `MockPriceSet`: Log when the mock price is updated.
    *   `ExternalSignalReceived`: Log when a mock external signal is triggered.

5.  **Modifiers:**
    *   `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to the contract owner.
    *   `whenNotPaused`: Prevents execution when paused.
    *   `whenPaused`: Allows execution only when paused.
    *   `protocolActive`: Ensures a protocol is in the 'Active' state.
    *   `protocolStatusIs`: Ensures a protocol is in a specific status.

6.  **Functions (Categorized):**
    *   **Admin/Setup:** Constructor, deposit, create protocol functions, ownership transfer, pause/unpause, fee settings, mock setters.
    *   **Protocol Execution/Interaction:** Functions for beneficiaries or specific users to claim/execute protocols (claim time lock, commit/reveal secret, execute multi-condition, execute conditional swap, approve/dispute escrow, execute recurring payment).
    *   **Query/View:** Functions to check balances, protocol details, and status of conditions.
    *   **Emergency:** (Optional, potentially limited) Function to handle unforeseen circumstances (e.g., owner cancelling a protocol after a delay).
    *   **Internal/Helper:** Functions used internally (e.g., transfer logic, condition checking).

### Function Summary:

1.  `constructor(address _feeRecipient, uint256 _protocolFeeBps)`: Initializes the contract, sets owner, fee recipient, and protocol fee basis points.
2.  `receive()`: Allows receiving Ether directly into the vault.
3.  `fallback()`: Placeholder, could potentially handle specific data calls if needed, but kept simple.
4.  `depositETH()`: Allows depositing Ether into the vault by sending Ether to this function.
5.  `depositToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows depositing a specific ERC20 token into the vault.
6.  `createTimeLockProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint64 unlockTime)`: Creates a protocol releasing `amount` of `tokenAddress` to `beneficiary` after `unlockTime`. Requires depositing or having enough funds allocated.
7.  `createCommitRevealProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, bytes32 commitment, uint64 revealDeadline)`: Creates a protocol releasing funds if the beneficiary reveals a secret matching `commitment` before `revealDeadline`.
8.  `createMultiConditionProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, ConditionType[] conditionTypes, uint256[] conditionValues)`: Creates a protocol releasing funds only when *all* specified conditions (time, block, signal, bool flag) are met.
9.  `createConditionalSwapProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, address targetTokenAddress, uint256 minTargetAmount, uint256 maxSourcePrice)`: Creates a protocol that swaps `amount` of `tokenAddress` for `targetTokenAddress` if the price (simulated) is favorable (source token price per target token <= `maxSourcePrice`), releasing the received tokens to `beneficiary`.
10. `createEscrowProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable depositor, address payable beneficiary, address approver, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint64 disputeEndTime)`: Creates an escrow where `depositor`'s funds for `beneficiary` are held and released only if `approver` approves, or released back to `depositor` if disputed and dispute period ends.
11. `createRecurringPaymentProtocol(uint64 protocolId, address payable beneficiary, address tokenAddress, uint256 amountPerPayment, uint64 startTime, uint64 interval, uint64 endTime, uint256 maxPayments)`: Creates a protocol for recurring payments of `amountPerPayment` to `beneficiary` at set `interval`s between `startTime` and `endTime`, up to `maxPayments`.
12. `claimTimeLockedFunds(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows the beneficiary to claim funds from a TimeLock protocol once the unlock time has passed.
13. `commitSecret(uint64 protocolId, bytes32 commitment)`: Allows the *committer* (defined in creation, typically beneficiary or related party) to register their commitment for a CommitReveal protocol.
14. `revealSecretAndClaim(uint64 protocolId, bytes memory revealedSecret)`: Allows the beneficiary to reveal their secret. If the hash matches the commitment and it's before the deadline, funds are released.
15. `executeMultiConditionProtocol(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows the beneficiary to claim funds from a MultiCondition protocol if *all* conditions are currently met.
16. `triggerMultiConditionSignal(uint64 protocolId, uint256 conditionIndex)`: (Admin/Authorized) Allows triggering an 'ExternalSignal' condition within a MultiCondition protocol.
17. `executeConditionalSwapProtocol(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows the beneficiary (or anyone, perhaps with a fee) to attempt execution of a Conditional Swap protocol. Checks the simulated price and performs swap if favorable.
18. `approveEscrowProtocol(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows the designated `approver` to release funds from an Escrow protocol to the beneficiary.
19. `disputeEscrowProtocol(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows the depositor or beneficiary to initiate a dispute on an Escrow protocol.
20. `executeRecurringPayment(uint64 protocolId)`: Allows anyone to trigger the execution of a recurring payment. The payment is only made if the required time interval has passed since the last payment and within the protocol's end time and max payment limit.
21. `refundProtocolFunds(uint64 protocolId)`: (Owner/Admin) Allows the owner to refund funds allocated to a protocol back to the vault's general balance, typically used if a protocol fails or is cancelled under specific conditions.
22. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership (standard OpenZeppelin).
23. `pauseContract()`: Pauses contract functions (standard OpenZeppelin).
24. `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses contract functions (standard OpenZeppelin).
25. `setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient)`: Sets the address receiving protocol fees.
26. `setProtocolFee(uint256 _protocolFeeBps)`: Sets the fee percentage (in basis points) applied to protocol executions (if applicable, e.g., recurring payments, conditional swaps).
27. `setMockPrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken, uint256 price)`: (Admin) Sets a simulated price for a token pair, used by ConditionalSwap. Price is represented as `price` units of `quoteToken` per 1 unit of `baseToken`.
28. `checkProtocolStatus(uint64 protocolId)`: (View) Returns the current status of a protocol.
29. `getProtocolDetails(uint64 protocolId)`: (View) Returns the main details of a protocol.
30. `getMultiConditionStatus(uint64 protocolId)`: (View) Returns the status of each individual condition in a MultiCondition protocol.
31. `getMockPrice(address baseToken, address quoteToken)`: (View) Returns the currently set mock price for a token pair.
32. `getVaultBalanceETH()`: (View) Returns the contract's current ETH balance.
33. `getVaultBalanceToken(address tokenAddress)`: (View) Returns the contract's current balance of a specific ERC20 token.

*(This list easily exceeds 20 functions, covering admin, user interaction, queries, and various complex protocol types)*

**Explanation and Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multiple Protocol Types:** Instead of a single release mechanism (like a simple time lock), the contract supports several distinct, complex `ProtocolType`s (`TimeLock`, `CommitReveal`, `MultiCondition`, `ConditionalSwap`, `Escrow`, `RecurringPayment`). This allows for highly customized release conditions.
2.  **State Management per Protocol:** Each protocol instance (`protocols[protocolId]`) has its own state (`ProtocolStatus`) and specific details stored in dedicated mappings (`timeLockDetails`, `commitRevealDetails`, etc.). This keeps track of where each portion of the vault's funds is allocated and what its current state is.
3.  **Fund Allocation:** When a protocol is created, the required funds (`amount`) are marked as `allocatedAmount`. While not physically moved to separate addresses (to save gas), this internal accounting ensures that these funds cannot be used by other protocols or withdrawn generally, even if the total vault balance is higher. Only successful protocol execution or explicit refund releases the allocation.
4.  **Commit-Reveal Scheme (`CommitReveal` Protocol):** This allows a party to commit to a hashed secret initially. Later, they (the beneficiary) must reveal the *actual* secret. If the hash of the revealed secret matches the commitment, they get the funds. This is used in various cryptographic protocols and auctions.
5.  **Multi-Conditional Logic (`MultiCondition` Protocol):** This protocol requires a *combination* of conditions to be met simultaneously (or sequentially, depending on implementation) before funds are released. The conditions can be time-based, block-based, triggered by an external signal (simulated here), or based on simple boolean flags. The `checkCondition` helper encapsulates this complex logic.
6.  **Conditional Execution / Simulated Oracle (`ConditionalSwap` Protocol):** This protocol attempts to simulate a token swap, but only if a predefined price condition is met. This is an example of using external data (a price feed, simulated here via `setMockPrice`) to trigger on-chain action. A real implementation would integrate with Chainlink or similar oracle networks.
7.  **Escrow with Dispute (`Escrow` Protocol):** Implements a basic escrow where a third party (`approver`) must approve the release to the beneficiary. It includes a `dispute` mechanism allowing parties to register disagreement, which could potentially lead to funds being returned to the depositor after a timeout.
8.  **Recurring Payments (`RecurringPayment` Protocol):** Allows setting up scheduled, periodic transfers. This is triggered by *anyone* (`executeRecurringPayment`), incentivized possibly by a small fee taken from the payment itself (`protocolFeeBps`). The contract tracks the last payment time and total payments made.
9.  **Explicit Refund Mechanism (`refundProtocolFunds`):** Provides an escape hatch for the owner to recover funds allocated to protocols that become impossible to complete or are cancelled, preventing funds from being permanently locked. This needs careful access control.
10. **Modular Design:** Using enums and structs for different protocol types makes the contract extensible. New protocol types can potentially be added without rewriting the core storage or execution logic significantly, though adding new structs and mappings is required.
11. **Standard Libraries:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`, `Pausable`, and `ReentrancyGuard` for security and common contract patterns. `SafeERC20` is used for safer token interactions.
12. **View Functions:** Includes numerous view functions to allow anyone to inspect the state of the vault and its protocols without making transactions.

This contract attempts to be creative by combining multiple advanced concepts within a single "vault" structure, offering various programmable money flows based on diverse triggers and conditions. It's a significant step up in complexity from standard examples. Remember that complex contracts require thorough auditing before deployment in production.
