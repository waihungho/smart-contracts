10. **`assignFeatureAccessRole(string memory featureName, string memory roleName) onlyAdmin`**: Associates a specific feature with a required reputation role for access control, restricted to admin.
11. **`checkFeatureAccess(string memory featureName, address user) view returns (bool)`**: Checks if a user has the required reputation to access a specific feature based on assigned roles.
12. **`stakeForReputation(uint256 amount) payable`**: Allows users to stake ETH into the contract, boosting their effective reputation based on a staking factor.
13. **`unstakeForReputation(uint256 amount)`**: Allows users to unstake ETH from the contract, reducing their reputation boost and transferring ETH back to the user.
14. **`setStakingBoostFactor(uint256 newFactor) onlyAdmin`**: Sets the factor that determines the reputation boost per unit of staked ETH, restricted to admin.
15. **`getStakingBoostFactor() view returns (uint256)`**: Returns the currently configured staking boost factor.
16. **`delegateReputation(address delegateTo)`**: Allows a user to delegate their reputation influence to another address, effectively sharing their reputation for certain purposes.
17. **`revokeReputationDelegation()`**: Revokes any existing reputation delegation made by the user.
18. **`viewDelegatedReputation(address user) view returns (address)`**: Returns the address to which a user has delegated their reputation, or address(0) if no delegation.
19. **`setFeatureEnabled(string memory featureName, bool enabled) onlyAdmin`**: Enables or disables specific contract features, allowing for modularity and control over functionality, restricted to admin.
20. **`isFeatureEnabled(string memory featureName) view returns (bool)`**: Checks if a specific contract feature is currently enabled.
21. **`emergencyPauseContract() onlyAdmin`**: Pauses critical functionalities of the contract in case of an emergency, halting operations, restricted to admin.
22. **`emergencyUnpauseContract() onlyAdmin`**: Resumes contract functionalities after an emergency pause, restoring normal operations, restricted to admin.
23. **`getContractInfo() view returns (string memory name, string memory version, string memory description)`**: Returns basic information about the contract, such as its name, version, and description.

**Key Advanced Concepts and Trendy Features Implemented:**

*   **Dynamic Reputation Decay:** Reputation points decrease over time, encouraging continued positive engagement or activity to maintain reputation.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) based on Reputation:**  Features are gated by reputation roles, allowing for tiered access and privilege levels within the contract based on user reputation.
*   **Staking for Reputation Boost:** Integrates a DeFi concept by allowing users to stake ETH to temporarily boost their reputation, linking financial commitment to reputation.
*   **Reputation Delegation:** Introduces a novel concept of reputation delegation, where users can lend their reputation influence to others, potentially for governance or collaborative actions.
*   **Feature Flags:**  The contract uses feature flags to enable/disable functionalities, providing modularity and control for the contract administrator to manage different aspects of the contract.
*   **Emergency Pause/Unpause:** Includes emergency stop mechanisms, a crucial security feature for smart contracts to mitigate risks and respond to unforeseen issues.
*   **On-chain Event Logging (Basic):** Includes a simple event log within the contract to track key actions and changes, enhancing transparency and auditability (though in a real-world scenario, using standard event emitters is more robust for off-chain monitoring).

**How it's Creative and Trendy:**

*   **Combines Reputation and Access Control in a Dynamic Way:** Goes beyond simple reputation scoring by directly linking reputation to feature access and incorporating time-based decay and staking boost.
*   **Integrates DeFi Elements with Reputation:** The staking for reputation boost ties financial incentives to reputation, which is a trendy intersection of DeFi and reputation systems.
*   **Reputation Delegation is a Novel Feature:** This concept is not commonly found in open-source contracts and adds a layer of social interaction and potential for reputation-based governance or collaborative systems.
*   **Modular Design with Feature Flags:**  The use of feature flags makes the contract more adaptable and manageable, reflecting modern software development practices applied to smart contracts.

This contract provides a comprehensive example of a smart contract with advanced concepts and creative features, aiming to be distinct from common open-source examples while showcasing interesting possibilities within Solidity development. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deployment.
