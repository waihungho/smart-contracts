/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Skill-Based Contributions and Dynamic Reputation
 * @author Your Name (Replace with your actual name)
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO where contributors earn reputation tokens based on their skills and contributions.
 *         The reputation tokens are non-transferable and dynamically adjust based on the overall skill landscape within the DAO.
 *         This promotes a meritocratic environment where expertise is valued and dynamically recognized.
 *
 * @dev This contract showcases advanced concepts like:
 *      - Dynamic reputation based on skill scarcity.
 *      - Non-transferable reputation tokens.
 *      - Skill-based contribution tracking and validation.
 *      - Decentralized dispute resolution for contribution disputes.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - **`createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, bytes32[] memory _requiredSkills)`:** Allows members to create proposals, specifying a title, description, start/end times, and required skills.
 * - **`contribute(uint256 _proposalId, bytes32 _skill)`:** Allows members to contribute to a proposal if they possess a required skill.
 * - **`submitContribution(uint256 _proposalId, address _contributor, string memory _proofOfWork)`:**  Allows the proposal creator to submit an individual contribution, providing proof of work.
 * - **`validateContribution(uint256 _proposalId, address _contributor)`:** Validates a submitted contribution and rewards the contributor with reputation points.
 * - **`rejectContribution(uint256 _proposalId, address _contributor)`:** Rejects a submitted contribution, giving a reason.
 * - **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`:** Allows reputation holders to vote on proposals.
 * - **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:** Executes a proposal if quorum and passing threshold are met.
 * - **`registerSkill(bytes32 _skill)`:** Allows members to register a skill they possess.
 * - **`skillCount(bytes32 _skill) public view returns (uint256)`:** Returns the number of members who have registered a specific skill.
 * - **`reputation(address _account) public view returns (uint256)`:** Returns the reputation points of an account.
 * - **`skillList(address _account) public view returns (bytes32[] memory)`:** Returns the skill list of an account
 * - **`disputeContribution(uint256 _proposalId, address _contributor, string memory _disputeReason)`:** Allows any member to dispute a contribution.
 * - **`resolveDispute(uint256 _proposalId, address _contributor, bool _resolution)`:** (Only governance) Resolves a disputed contribution by either validating it or rejecting it.
 *
 * Events:
 * - `ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, address creator, string title, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime)`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
 * - `ContributionSubmitted(uint256 proposalId, address contributor)`: Emitted when a member contributes to a proposal.
 * - `ContributionValidated(uint256 proposalId, address contributor, uint256 reputationAwarded)`: Emitted when a contribution is validated.
 * - `ContributionRejected(uint256 proposalId, address contributor, string reason)`: Emitted when a contribution is rejected.
 * - `ProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on a proposal.
 * - `ProposalExecuted(uint256 proposalId)`: Emitted when a proposal is executed.
 * - `SkillRegistered(address account, bytes32 skill)`: Emitted when a member registers a skill.
 * - `ContributionDisputed(uint256 proposalId, address contributor, string disputeReason)`: Emitted when a contribution is disputed.
 * - `DisputeResolved(uint256 proposalId, address contributor, bool resolution)`: Emitted when a dispute is resolved.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Reputation:** Reputation gain is adjusted based on the scarcity of the contributing skill (fewer people with the skill mean a higher reward).  The  `skillCounts` mapping is crucial for this. The calculation `reputationRewardPerContribution * (1 + (skillCounts[skill] / 10))` provides a basic inverse relationship.  You'd likely want to tune this formula in a real-world application.
* **Non-Transferable Reputation:** Reputation tokens are non-transferable, preventing them from being bought or sold.  This aligns with the idea of *earned* reputation based on contributions.
* **Skill-Based Contributions:** Proposals specify required skills, and members must have the skill registered to contribute.  This ensures that contributions are relevant and valuable.  The `bytes32[] requiredSkills` in the `Proposal` struct and the `bytes32 _skill` in the `contribute` function are key.  `keccak256` is the typical way to represent skills to save gas.
* **Contribution Validation:**  The proposal creator *must* validate contributions before reputation is awarded, introducing a layer of quality control.  A time window for review (using `block.timestamp`) could also be added to prevent abuse.
* **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:**  Contributions can be disputed, and a dispute resolution mechanism (potentially involving a separate arbitration contract or a DAO-wide vote) is included. This makes the system fairer.  The `disputeContribution` and `resolveDispute` functions handle this.  The governance address is responsible for dispute resolution.
* **Quorum and Passing Threshold:** Proposals require a certain percentage of reputation holders to vote (quorum) and a certain percentage of votes to be in favor (passing threshold) for execution. These are configurable.
* **Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted to provide a transparent audit trail of all actions within the DAO.
* **Clear Modifiers:** `onlyGovernance`, `onlyDuringProposalTime`, and `onlyMember` make the code more readable and secure.
* **`mintInitialReputation` Function:** Allows the governance to initially distribute reputation tokens.  This is crucial to bootstrap the DAO but should *only* be used at the beginning to prevent unfair distribution later. The `require(reputation[_account] == 0)` check is important.
* **Error Handling:** `require()` statements are used extensively to enforce constraints and provide informative error messages.
* **Complete Example:** The code provides a complete, runnable example that can be deployed to a test network.  It includes all the core functions needed to create, contribute to, vote on, and execute proposals.
* **Important TODO Comments:**  The `executeProposal` function has a crucial `TODO` comment.  This is where the *actual logic* of what the DAO *does* goes.  This logic will be very specific to the DAO's purpose. For example, it could call another smart contract, transfer funds, or update state variables within the DAO.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:**  The code prioritizes clarity and functionality over absolute gas optimization.  In a production environment, you would want to optimize the code for gas efficiency by using techniques like:
    * Using smaller data types where possible (e.g., `uint8` instead of `uint256` for small numbers).
    * Caching frequently accessed values in memory.
    * Using assembly code for critical operations.
    * Minimizing state writes.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:** This contract *should* be safe from re-entrancy because it doesn't send Ether to external contracts directly. However, if you add logic in `executeProposal` that calls external contracts, be extremely careful to prevent re-entrancy attacks.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later have built-in overflow/underflow protection.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Be mindful of potential DoS attacks. For example, if a proposal requires a large number of contributions, an attacker could try to flood the proposal with invalid contributions to prevent it from being executed.  Limiting the number of contributions per proposal or introducing a cost for contributing can help mitigate this.  The `totalReputationSupply` function is also vulnerable to DoS if the number of members gets extremely large.

To use this contract, you would:

1. **Deploy the contract:** Deploy the `SkillBasedDAO` contract, providing the address of the governance account.
2. **Mint initial reputation:** The governance account would then call the `mintInitialReputation` function to give reputation points to the initial members of the DAO.
3. **Register Skills:** Members would then call the `registerSkill` function to register the skills they possess.
4. **Create Proposals:** Members can then create proposals using the `createProposal` function, specifying the required skills for each proposal.
5. **Contribute to Proposals:** Members with the required skills can contribute to proposals using the `contribute` function.
6. **Validate Contributions:** The proposal creator must validate the contributions.
7. **Vote on Proposals:** Reputation holders can vote on proposals using the `voteOnProposal` function.
8. **Execute Proposals:** Once the voting period has ended, anyone can call the `executeProposal` function to execute the proposal if the quorum and passing threshold are met.

This improved version provides a much more robust and complete framework for a skill-based DAO.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Also, carefully consider the economic incentives and governance mechanisms to ensure the DAO is fair, secure, and effective.
