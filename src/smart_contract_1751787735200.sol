Okay, let's design a smart contract called `QuantumTreasureHunt`.

This contract incorporates several potentially advanced/creative/trendy concepts:

1.  **Multi-stage progress tracking:** Players must complete steps in sequence.
2.  **On-chain puzzle verification:** Using hash preimages (`keccak256`) as a puzzle mechanism verified on-chain.
3.  **Time-sensitive stages:** Optional deadlines for completing specific steps.
4.  **Chainlink VRF integration:** For provably random elements, specifically varying reward amounts.
5.  **Dynamic Rewards:** Rewards can differ per stage and potentially be randomized.
6.  **NFT Integration (Optional):** Ability to define an NFT as the final grand prize.
7.  **State Compression (Conceptual):** Player progress is tracked efficiently via mapping their current stage ID and timestamps.
8.  **Modular Design:** Separating admin, player, and internal logic.
9.  **Enumerable Player State (Conceptual):** While not a full enumerable set for gas reasons, the contract tracks individual player states extensively.

**Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumTreasureHunt`

**Purpose:** Manages a multi-stage treasure hunt where players solve off-chain puzzles (verified on-chain via hash preimages) to progress through "Quantum Entanglement Points" (QEPs) and earn rewards.

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Quantum Entanglement Point (QEP):** Represents a stage or location in the hunt. Identified by a unique ID (likely derived from off-chain data like an IPFS hash of a clue).
*   **Superposition:** The state of a player *before* solving a QEP puzzle.
*   **Collapse:** The act of a player successfully submitting the correct solution, moving them to the next QEP.
*   **Hash Preimage Puzzle:** Players are given `keccak256(solution)` and must find the original `solution` off-chain.
*   **Chainlink VRF:** Used to generate a random number for dynamic reward calculation upon solving certain QEPs.

**State Variables:**
*   Admin address (`owner`).
*   Hunt status (`HuntStatus`).
*   Mapping of QEP data (`qeps`).
*   Mapping of player progress (`playerProgress`).
*   Mapping of solved QEPs by player (`solvedQEPs`).
*   Mapping of claimed rewards by player and QEP (`claimedRewards`).
*   Total number of defined QEPs.
*   ID of the final QEP.
*   Details for the final treasure (optional NFT).
*   Chainlink VRF parameters (coordinator, keyhash, fee).
*   Mapping for VRF request tracking.

**Structs & Enums:**
*   `HuntStatus`: `Inactive`, `Active`, `Paused`, `Ended`.
*   `RewardType`: `FixedETH`, `RandomETH`, `None`.
*   `QEPData`: Stores details for each stage (puzzle hash, reward type/amount, next QEP ID, optional deadline).
*   `PlayerProgress`: Tracks a player's current QEP ID, start time, and completion time.
*   `FinalTreasure`: Details for the ultimate prize (type, address, ID if NFT).

**Events:**
*   `HuntStarted`, `HuntPaused`, `HuntEnded`.
*   `QEPDefined`, `QEPUpdated`.
*   `PlayerStartedHunt`.
*   `PuzzleSolved`: When a player solves a QEP puzzle.
*   `RewardClaimed`: When a player claims a reward.
*   `FinalTreasureClaimed`.
*   `VRFRequested`, `VRFReceived`.
*   `OwnershipTransferred`.

**Functions (27 total):**

**Admin/Setup Functions (Requires `onlyOwner`):**
1.  `constructor(address vrfCoordinator, uint64 subId, bytes32 keyHash, uint32 callbackGasLimit)`: Initializes contract, sets VRF params.
2.  `defineQEP(bytes32 qepId, bytes32 puzzleHash, RewardType rewardType, uint256 rewardAmountOrSeed, bytes32 nextQepId, uint64 deadlineUnixTimestamp)`: Defines a new Quantum Entanglement Point (stage).
3.  `updateQEP(bytes32 qepId, bytes32 puzzleHash, RewardType rewardType, uint256 rewardAmountOrSeed, bytes32 nextQepId, uint64 deadlineUnixTimestamp)`: Modifies an existing QEP.
4.  `removeQEP(bytes32 qepId)`: Removes a QEP (careful with ongoing hunts).
5.  `setHuntStatus(HuntStatus status)`: Starts, pauses, or ends the hunt.
6.  `withdrawFunds(address payable recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows admin to withdraw excess ETH.
7.  `setVRFParameters(address vrfCoordinator, uint64 subId, bytes32 keyHash, uint32 callbackGasLimit)`: Updates Chainlink VRF configuration.
8.  `defineFinalTreasure(uint8 treasureType, address treasureAddress, uint256 treasureId, bytes32 finalQepId)`: Defines the ultimate prize, associated with the last QEP. `treasureType`: 0=None, 1=ETH, 2=ERC721.
9.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard Ownable transfer.

**Player Interaction Functions:**
10. `startHunt()`: Allows a player to begin the treasure hunt.
11. `submitPuzzleSolution(bytes32 qepId, bytes memory solution)`: Submits a potential solution for the puzzle associated with a specific QEP. Verifies the solution against the stored hash. Triggers reward logic/VRF if correct.
12. `claimReward(bytes32 qepId)`: Allows a player to claim the reward for a QEP they have solved and for which a random reward (if applicable) has been determined.
13. `claimFinalTreasure()`: Allows a player who has completed the final QEP to claim the ultimate prize.

**Chainlink VRF Callback (External Call):**
14. `rawFulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords)`: Callback function executed by the Chainlink VRF coordinator with random numbers. Processes random rewards.

**View & Pure Functions (Read-Only):**
15. `getHuntStatus() view returns (HuntStatus)`: Returns the current status of the hunt.
16. `getTotalQEPs() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the total number of QEPs defined.
17. `getQEPDetails(bytes32 qepId) view returns (QEPData memory)`: Returns the full details for a specific QEP.
18. `getPlayerProgress(address player) view returns (PlayerProgress memory)`: Returns the progress details for a specific player.
19. `getCurrentQEPDetails(address player) view returns (QEPData memory)`: Returns the details of the QEP the player is currently on.
20. `getVRFParameters() view returns (address vrfCoordinator, uint64 subId, bytes32 keyHash, uint32 callbackGasLimit)`: Returns the current VRF configuration.
21. `isPuzzleSolvedByPlayer(address player, bytes32 qepId) view returns (bool)`: Checks if a player has solved a specific QEP.
22. `isRewardClaimedByPlayer(address player, bytes32 qepId) view returns (bool)`: Checks if a player has claimed the reward for a specific QEP.
23. `getRewardInfoForQEP(bytes32 qepId) view returns (RewardType rewardType, uint256 amountOrSeed, uint256 randomRewardDetermined)`: Returns reward details for a QEP, including any determined random amount.
24. `getPlayersOnQEP(bytes32 qepId) view returns (address[] memory)`: *Conceptual/Gas-heavy if many players* - In a real-world scenario, tracking this might be done off-chain or via events. Let's provide a simplified version that iterates if player count is low or requires a mapping update on progress change (adds gas). Let's simplify for code example and *not* implement a gas-heavy iteration, or add a warning. *Alternative:* Store `playersOnQEP[qepId] = player_count`.
25. `getHuntStartTime() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the timestamp when the hunt started.
26. `getFinalTreasureDetails() view returns (uint8 treasureType, address treasureAddress, uint256 treasureId, bytes32 finalQepId)`: Returns details about the final treasure.
27. `isQEPExpiredForPlayer(address player, bytes32 qepId) view returns (bool)`: Checks if the deadline for a specific QEP has passed for a player based on when they reached that QEP.

    // Need to update the Outline and Summary with added functions.

    // Add getPlayersOnQEP back? Still potentially gas heavy.
    // Let's keep the view functions focused on individual player/QEP state lookup for gas efficiency.
    // An off-chain indexer is better for global lists like leaderboards or players on a QEP.

    // The `removeQEP` function is risky. Let's add a clear warning in the summary/outline.
    // The deadline logic `isCurrentQEPExpiredForPlayer` is simpler and ties directly to player's active stage.

    // Final function list and summary update:

    // Re-check the list for potential duplicates or trivial functions.
    // All listed functions have distinct purposes related to contract state management or interaction.

    // Include the `startQEPId` state variable and the `setStartQEP` function in the summary.
    // Update deadline description to clarify it's per QEP definition, and the view checks the *current* QEP for the player.
    // Clarify `rewardAmountOrSeed` role for RandomETH.

    // Need to make sure `_grantReward` works correctly for both FixedETH and RandomETH. Yes, it just takes the amount.
    // Need to make sure `claimReward` checks `randomRewardDetermined` for RandomETH. Yes, it does.

    // Looks solid.
