Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines several interesting and slightly advanced concepts:

1.  **Dynamic State NFTs:** NFTs whose properties (like "Life Force") decay over time and can be influenced by user actions.
2.  **Epoch-Based Rewards:** A system that distributes a resource (like "Wisdom" tokens) based on participation and time, potentially with varying rates per epoch.
3.  **Resource Generation:** NFTs passively generate an ERC-20 token based on their state and external factors (like epochs).
4.  **Crafting/Synthesis:** A mechanism to combine existing NFTs (and potentially tokens) to create new ones with potentially improved properties.
5.  **Staking/Meditation:** Locking NFTs to earn boosted passive rewards.
6.  **Conditional Logic:** Behavior changing based on the current epoch or other state variables.
7.  **Internal Accounting:** Tracking earned rewards per user and per NFT.
8.  **Access Control & Pausability:** Standard best practices.
9.  **Interaction with ERC-20:** Receiving tokens for actions and distributing tokens as rewards.

We'll call this the "Chronicle Protocol". Users own "Chronicles" (NFTs).

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `ChronicleProtocol`

**Purpose:** A smart contract managing dynamic NFTs ("Chronicles") that generate an ERC-20 token ("Wisdom") based on their state and the current epoch. It includes mechanisms for energizing, synthesizing, and meditating with Chronicles.

**Key Components:**

*   **Chronicles (ERC-721):** NFTs with dynamic `lifeForce`, `creationTime`, `lastEnergized`, and tracking for wisdom generation.
*   **Wisdom (ERC-20):** An external token contract address used for payments (energizing/synthesizing) and rewards (claiming). *Note: The ERC-20 contract itself is assumed to be deployed separately.*
*   **Epochs:** Time periods defining reward rates and potentially other system parameters.
*   **Meditation:** A staking mechanism where users lock Chronicles to earn boosted Wisdom.

**Function Summary (Minimum 20 functions):**

**I. Core Protocol Management (Admin/Owner)**
1.  `constructor`: Initializes the contract, sets the Wisdom token address, epoch duration, and initial parameters.
2.  `setWisdomToken`: Sets the address of the ERC-20 Wisdom token (only if not set in constructor, or for potential future upgrade considerations, careful with this in prod).
3.  `setEpochDuration`: Sets the length of each epoch.
4.  `setWisdomRatePerForcePerEpoch`: Sets the base rate at which life force generates wisdom within an epoch.
5.  `setEnergizeCost`: Sets the cost in Wisdom tokens to energize a Chronicle.
6.  `setSynthesisCost`: Sets the cost in Wisdom tokens to synthesize new Chronicles.
7.  `setCreateCost`: Sets the cost in Wisdom tokens to create a new Chronicle.
8.  `pause`: Pauses key protocol actions.
9.  `unpause`: Unpauses the protocol.
10. `withdrawFees`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated Wisdom tokens from synthesis/creation/energize costs.

**II. Chronicle Lifecycle (User Actions)**
11. `createChronicle`: Mints a new Chronicle NFT for the caller, potentially costing Wisdom tokens. Assigns initial `lifeForce`.
12. `energizeChronicle`: Spends Wisdom tokens to increase the `lifeForce` of a specified Chronicle. Calculates decay since last energized before adding force.
13. `synthesizeChronicles`: Burns two specified parent Chronicles and spends Wisdom tokens to mint a new child Chronicle. The child's `lifeForce` is derived from parents (e.g., average/sum).
14. `claimWisdom`: Calculates and transfers accumulated Wisdom tokens earned by all Chronicles owned or energized by the caller. Resets earned counters.

**III. Meditation (Staking) (User Actions)**
15. `startMeditation`: Locks a specified Chronicle NFT in the contract, marking it as meditating.
16. `endMeditation`: Unlocks a meditating Chronicle NFT, transferring it back to the owner. Calculates and adds bonus Wisdom earned during meditation to the user's claimable balance.
17. `getMeditationState`: View function to check if a Chronicle is currently meditating and when meditation started.

**IV. Epoch Management (Protocol/User)**
18. `advanceEpoch`: Callable by anyone. Checks if the current epoch has ended based on duration and time. If so, advances to the next epoch, updates state, and potentially triggers epoch-end logic (e.g., recalculating global rates - though we'll keep epoch logic simple in this example).
19. `getCurrentEpoch`: View function to get the current epoch number.
20. `getTimeUntilNextEpoch`: View function to get the time remaining in the current epoch.

**V. Information / Views**
21. `getChronicleState`: View function to retrieve the full state (`lifeForce`, `creationTime`, etc.) of a specific Chronicle.
22. `calculatePendingWisdom`: View function to calculate the amount of Wisdom a user can currently claim *without* actually claiming it.
23. `getTotalChronicles`: View function for the total number of Chronicles minted.

**VI. Standard ERC-721 Functions (Required for Compliance)**
24. `balanceOf(address owner)`
25. `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`
26. `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
27. `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
28. `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data)`
29. `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
30. `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`
31. `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`
32. `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`
33. `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)` (For ERC-165 compliance)

**(Total Functions: 33, well over the requested 20)**

Let's implement this. We'll use OpenZeppelin contracts for standard components like ERC721, Ownable, and Pausable to focus on the custom logic.

**Explanation of Concepts and Implementation Details:**

1.  **Dynamic State (`lifeForce`, `lastEnergized`):** The `Chronicle` struct holds these fields. `_decayLifeForce` is the core internal function that calculates the passage of time since the last interaction (`lastEnergized`) and reduces `lifeForce` accordingly. This function is called strategically before any action that might change ownership (`_update`, `_burn`), modify state (`energize`), or involve reward calculation (`claimWisdom`, `endMeditation`). This ensures that decay and wisdom calculation are always up-to-date when needed.
2.  **Epoch-Based Rewards (`currentEpoch`, `epochDuration`, `wisdomRatePerForcePerEpoch`):** The contract tracks the current epoch and its start time. `advanceEpoch` allows anyone to move to the next epoch if the required time has passed. The `_decayLifeForce` function uses the `wisdomRatePerForcePerEpoch` (adjusted by `epochDuration`) to determine how much wisdom is generated based on the `lifeForce` and the time passed.
3.  **Resource Generation (`wisdomGeneratedPerEpoch`, `_wisdomEarnedTotal`, `claimWisdom`):** When `_decayLifeForce` is called, it calculates wisdom earned since the last update and adds it to the user's total claimable balance stored in `_wisdomEarnedTotal`. `claimWisdom` simply transfers the user's balance from this mapping and resets it. We accumulate per user to avoid iterating over tokens during claiming, which is more gas efficient.
4.  **Crafting/Synthesis (`synthesizeChronicles`):** This function takes two token IDs, checks ownership/approval, costs Wisdom tokens, burns the parent tokens using `_burn`, and mints a new child token using `_safeMint`. The child's initial `lifeForce` is derived from the parents' state *before* they are burned. The `_burn` override ensures that any pending wisdom for the parents is calculated and credited before they are destroyed.
5.  **Staking/Meditation (`startMeditation`, `endMeditation`, `chronicleMeditationStartTime`, `_meditatingTokenOriginalOwner`, `MEDITATION_BONUS_RATE`):** `startMeditation` transfers the NFT into the contract's custody and records the start time and original owner. `endMeditation` checks the original owner, calls `_decayLifeForce` (which includes the meditation bonus calculation due to the `meditationBonusMultiplier`), resets the state, and transfers the NFT back. The `_update` override prevents meditating tokens from being transferred using standard ERC721 methods.
6.  **Conditional Logic:** The epoch advancement is time-gated. Meditation provides a conditional bonus rate in the wisdom calculation. Pausing restricts access to most functions.
7.  **Internal Accounting (`_wisdomEarnedTotal`, `chronicles` struct fields):** Wisdom is tracked per user (`_wisdomEarnedTotal`). Individual chronicle stats (`lifeForce`, `wisdomGeneratedPerEpoch` - though the latter is less critical with the user-level total accumulator) are stored in the `chronicles` mapping.
8.  **Access Control & Pausability:** `Ownable` and `Pausable` from OpenZeppelin provide standard admin control and emergency pausing.
9.  **Interaction with ERC-20 (`wisdomToken`, `SafeERC20`):** The contract holds the address of the Wisdom token. `SafeERC20` is used for safe token transfers (handling pre-EIP-20 tokens and returning booleans). Wisdom tokens are transferred *into* the contract for creation, energizing, and synthesis costs, and transferred *out* for claiming rewards and fee withdrawal.

This contract provides a complex, interlinked system demonstrating dynamic state, time-based mechanics, resource generation, token burning/minting (synthesis), and staking within an NFT framework, covering well over 20 functions with varying levels of complexity.

Remember that deploying and managing such a contract requires careful consideration of gas costs (especially in iterations or complex calculations like `claimWisdom` if the user owns *many* tokens), potential reentrancy risks ( mitigated here by using `SafeERC20` and avoiding external calls before state updates), and upgradeability (this example is not upgradeable, but in production, a proxy pattern like UUPS would be essential).
