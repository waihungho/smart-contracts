Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Multi-Layered DAO with NFT-Gated Access and Dynamic Governance".

This contract incorporates:
1.  **Multi-Layered Membership:** Users can belong to different "layers" based on criteria, specifically holding certain NFTs.
2.  **NFT Gating:** Access to features, voting power, or membership layers is determined by owning specific NFTs from configured collections.
3.  **Dynamic Governance:** Key governance parameters (like proposal threshold, voting period, quorum) can be changed by the DAO itself through proposals.
4.  **Treasury Management:** The contract can hold and manage ERC20 tokens, Native Currency (ETH), and NFTs, only allowing transfers via successful proposals.
5.  **Batch Execution:** Proposals can bundle multiple actions into a single transaction.
6.  **Timelock Mechanism:** Executing sensitive proposals requires a time delay after voting succeeds.
7.  **Delegation:** Standard voting power delegation.
8.  **Role-Based Access (Council):** An optional 'Council' layer with specific privileges, also managed by governance.

It aims to be creative by tying governance influence directly to external, potentially dynamic NFT ownership and implementing a tiered membership structure within the DAO context. It avoids directly copying standard OpenZeppelin Governance, adding significant custom logic for the layering, NFT checks, and integrated treasury/parameter management.

**Smart Contract: MultiLayerDAO**

**Outline:**

1.  **Pragma and Imports:** Specify Solidity version and import necessary interfaces (ERC20, ERC721, SafeERC20) and utility libraries (Ownable for initial setup).
2.  **Errors:** Define custom errors for clarity.
3.  **Events:** Declare events for tracking key actions (Proposals, Votes, Execution, Parameter Changes, Membership changes, Asset transfers, Timelock).
4.  **Structs:** Define the `Proposal` struct to hold all information about a governance proposal, including batch call data.
5.  **Enums:** Define `ProposalState` to track the lifecycle of a proposal.
6.  **State Variables:**
    *   Owner (for initial setup/emergencies).
    *   Treasury address.
    *   Governance parameters (`proposalThreshold`, `votingPeriod`, `quorumNumerator`, `quorumDenominator`, `timelockDelay`, `executionWindow`).
    *   Proposal counter.
    *   Mapping for proposals (`proposals`).
    *   Mapping for votes (`proposalId => voter => support`).
    *   Mapping for member layers (`address => uint256`).
    *   Mapping for Council members (`address => bool`).
    *   Mappings for NFT requirements for each layer (`layerId => collectionAddress => minCount`).
    *   Mapping for required NFT collection addresses (`layerId => arrayIndex => collectionAddress`).
    *   Mapping for queued proposals (`proposalId => eta`).
7.  **Modifiers:** Define modifiers for access control (`onlyCouncil`, `onlyMemberLayer`, `onlyActiveProposal`, etc. - *will integrate checks directly for clarity/flexibility in some functions*).
8.  **Constructor:** Initialize core parameters and the initial owner.
9.  **Core Governance Functions:**
    *   `propose` (Single call)
    *   `proposeBatch` (Multiple calls)
    *   `castVote` (Yes/No/Abstain)
    *   `queue` (For timelock)
    *   `execute` (After timelock)
    *   `cancel` (Cancel a proposal)
10. **View/Helper Functions (Governance):**
    *   `getProposalState`
    *   `getProposalDetails`
    *   `getVotingWeight` (Based on member layer)
    *   `getCurrentQuorum`
    *   `getTimelockStatus`
11. **Membership/Layer Functions:**
    *   `determineMemberLayer` (Internal helper)
    *   `getMemberLayer` (External view)
    *   `setRequiredNFTCollections` (Governance controlled)
    *   `updateRequiredNFTMinimums` (Governance controlled)
    *   `getRequiredNFTCollections` (View)
    *   `getRequiredNFTMinimums` (View)
12. **Council Management Functions:**
    *   `addCouncilMember` (Governance controlled)
    *   `removeCouncilMember` (Governance controlled)
    *   `isCouncilMember` (View)
13. **Treasury Management Functions:**
    *   `depositERC20` (Receive tokens)
    *   `depositNative` (Receive ETH)
    *   `batchWithdrawAssets` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
    *   `getTreasuryBalanceERC20` (View)
    *   `getTreasuryBalanceNative` (View)
14. **Dynamic Parameter Functions:**
    *   `setProposalThreshold` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
    *   `setVotingPeriod` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
    *   `setQuorumNumerator` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
    *   `setTimelockDelay` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
    *   `setExecutionWindow` (Callable ONLY by `execute`)
15. **Utility Functions:**
    *   `delegateVotingPower` (Standard token delegation - *Assumes a separate voting token or integrates logic, let's simplify by tying weight directly to layer/NFT for this example*) - *Correction:* Tying voting weight directly to layer/NFT makes delegation slightly different. We can skip standard token delegation and rely on address-based voting weight, or implement a custom layer-based delegation. Let's stick to direct layer-based voting weight for this example.
    *   `getVersion` (Simple version info)

**Function Summary (Counting towards >= 20):**

1.  `constructor`
2.  `propose` (Single call)
3.  `proposeBatch` (Multiple calls)
4.  `castVote`
5.  `queue`
6.  `execute`

    // The Ownable functions like `transferOwnership` are inherited.
    // It's crucial that ownership eventually is transferred to the DAO itself (address(this))
    // or a trusted multisig/guardian contract for decentralization.
    // A function to transfer ownership via a proposal would be essential in a real system.
    // For this example, keeping Ownable implies the deployer retains control initially.
    // In a real DAO, you'd add a proposal type or a specific proposal to `transferOwnership(address(this))`.

    // --- ERC721Holder Hooks ---
    // Implement necessary ERC721Holder hooks if accepting arbitrary NFTs.
    // This contract inherits ERC721Holder, which provides `onERC721Received`.
    // Make sure to handle received NFTs appropriately or restrict which can be received.
    // For simplicity, this contract accepts any ERC721 via `onERC721Received`.

    // Override the function defined in ERC721Holder to ensure we explicitly want to receive NFTs
    function onERC721Received(
        address operator,
        address from,
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes memory data
    ) public virtual override returns (bytes4) {
        // Add logic here if needed, e.g., restrict allowed NFT collections,
        // emit an event about receiving, etc.
        // For now, just return the standard selector to indicate successful reception.
         // Emit an event for clarity on received NFTs
        emit NFTTransferred(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId); // Emitting 'sent to self' event
        return this.onERC721Received.selector;

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multi-Layered Membership & NFT Gating:**
    *   `_memberLayers` mapping (though computed dynamically for simplicity here) and `determineMemberLayer` function implement tiered membership.
    *   `_layerNFTRequirements` and `_layerRequiredNFTCollections` map layers to required NFT collections and minimum counts.
    *   `getVotingWeight` ties voting power directly to the computed member layer, which is determined by NFT holdings.
    *   Functions like `castVote` and `propose` check `getVotingWeight` to enforce minimum layer/threshold requirements.
    *   Governance (via `execute`) can update NFT requirements using `setRequiredNFTCollections` and `updateRequiredNFTMinimums`, making the layer criteria dynamic.

2.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:**
    *   State variables like `proposalThreshold`, `votingPeriod`, `quorumNumerator`, `timelockDelay`, and `executionWindow` are not fixed constants.
    *   Setter functions (`setProposalThreshold`, etc.) exist for these parameters.
    *   These setters are designed to be called *only* by the contract's own `execute` function, meaning parameter changes must pass through the full governance process (proposal -> vote -> queue -> execute).

3.  **Integrated Treasury & Batch Execution:**
    *   The contract acts as its own treasury, capable of receiving ETH (`receive`) and ERC20 (`depositERC20`). It also inherits `ERC721Holder` to receive NFTs.
    *   Withdrawals of *any* asset type are not direct functions callable by users. Instead, they must be included as target calls within a `propose` or `proposeBatch` transaction. For example, a proposal to withdraw ETH would have a target address (the recipient), a value (the ETH amount), and empty signature/calldata. A proposal to withdraw ERC20 would target the ERC20 contract, value 0, signature `transfer(address,uint256)`, and calldata encoding the recipient and amount. An NFT withdrawal would target the ERC721 contract, value 0, signature `safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)`, and calldata encoding `address(this)`, the recipient, and tokenId.
    *   `proposeBatch` allows bundling multiple such treasury actions (and other arbitrary calls) into a single proposal.

4.  **Timelock Mechanism:**
    *   Proposals that succeed (`Succeeded` state) don't execute immediately.
    *   They must be `queue`d, which sets an `eta` (`execution time actual`) based on the current timestamp plus `timelockDelay`.
    *   `execute` can only be called after the `eta` and within the `executionWindow`. This provides a safety delay for potentially malicious or erroneous proposals to be identified and potentially countered off-chain or via emergency measures (if implemented).

5.  **Role-Based Access (Council):**
    *   The `_isCouncilMember` mapping defines a specific role.
    *   The `determineMemberLayer` function gives Council members the highest layer (Layer 3), granting them the highest voting weight.
    *   A specific rule allows Council members to cancel an `Active` proposal (`cancel` function), providing a potential emergency brake mechanism controlled by a specific group chosen by the DAO.
    *   Council membership is also managed via governance proposals (`addCouncilMember`, `removeCouncilMember`).

6.  **Error Handling:** Uses custom errors (`revert InvalidProposalId()`) introduced in Solidity 0.8.x for more gas-efficient and informative error reporting compared to simple `require` with strings.

This contract demonstrates how multiple modern Solidity and Web3 concepts can be integrated into a single, complex governance system, going beyond simple token-weighted voting or basic multisigs.
