Okay, let's design a smart contract that models a simplified, abstract "Quantum State Oracle". This contract will maintain a state represented by a mapping of abstract "basis states" to "amplitudes". It won't perform actual quantum computation, but will simulate key concepts like superposition, transformations (gates), and measurement-induced collapse, influenced by external data via an oracle. It will include placeholder functions for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof verification related to the state.

This concept is creative because it applies quantum mechanics metaphors to state management on a blockchain, advanced due to potential ZK integration and complex state transitions, and trendy in its nod towards complex computational concepts.

We'll aim for functions covering:
1.  **Admin & Setup:** Ownership, Oracle Management, Pausing.
2.  **State Management:** Initialization, Reset, Direct Amplitude Modification (restricted).
3.  **Simulated Quantum Operations:** Abstract functions representing "gates" or transformations that change the state amplitudes.
4.  **Measurement & Oracle Interaction:** Triggering probabilistic collapse based on external data/randomness.
5.  **Query & Inspection:** Reading the state, sum, measurement outcome, probability.
6.  **ZK Integration (Conceptual):** Placeholder functions for verifying ZK proofs about state properties.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Deploys the contract, setting the initial owner.
2.  `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: Allows the owner to set the address of the trusted oracle.
3.  `setZKVerifierContract(address _verifier)`: Allows the owner to set the address of a hypothetical ZK verifier contract.
4.  `pause()`: Allows the owner to pause state-altering operations.
5.  `unpause()`: Allows the owner to unpause the contract.
6.  `renounceOwnership()`: Standard Ownable function to give up ownership.
7.  `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard Ownable function to transfer ownership.
8.  `initializeState(uint256[] memory initialBasisStates, uint256[] memory initialAmplitudes)`: Initializes the state with a set of basis states and their corresponding amplitudes. Can only be called if the state is not already initialized or is reset. Requires `initialBasisStates.length == initialAmplitudes.length`. Resets the measured state if any.
9.  `resetState()`: Clears the current state, setting all amplitudes to zero, sum to zero, and flags to initial state. Callable by owner or oracle.
10. `addAmplitude(uint256 basisStateIndex, uint256 value)`: Adds a specific value to the amplitude of a basis state. Restricted to owner/oracle and requires state not to be measured.
11. `subtractAmplitude(uint256 basisStateIndex, uint256 value)`: Subtracts a specific value from the amplitude of a basis state. Restricted to owner/oracle, requires state not to be measured, and checks for underflow.
12. `applyAmplitudeScaling(uint256 basisStateIndex, uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator)`: Scales the amplitude of a specific basis state by a factor (numerator/denominator). Callable by oracle/owner, when not measured. Updates total sum.
13. `applyStateRotationSimulation(uint256 stateA, uint256 stateB, uint256 factor)`: Simulates rotating amplitude between two states. It moves a percentage (`factor` as a percent of current amplitude) of amplitude from `stateA` to `stateB`. Callable by oracle/owner, when not measured.
14. `applySuperpositionSplit(uint256 basisStateIndex, uint256 newState1, uint256 newState2, uint256 splitFactor)`: Splits the amplitude of `basisStateIndex` into `newState1` and `newState2`. `splitFactor` determines the ratio (e.g., 5000 for 50/50 split, out of 10000). Original state's amplitude is set to 0. Callable by oracle/owner, when not measured.
15. `applyDecoherenceSimulation(uint256 decayNumerator, uint256 decayDenominator)`: Simulates decoherence by multiplying all *current* amplitudes by a decay factor (`decayNumerator`/`decayDenominator`). Callable by oracle/owner, when not measured. Updates total sum.
16. `applyConditionalPhaseShiftSimulation(uint256 controlState, uint256 targetState, uint256 threshold, uint256 phaseShiftMagnitude)`: Simulates a controlled operation. If the amplitude of `controlState` is above `threshold`, the amplitude of `targetState` is modified by adding `phaseShiftMagnitude`. Callable by oracle/owner, when not measured.
17. `feedOracleMeasurementTrigger(uint256 oracleProvidedSeed)`: Callable *only* by the configured oracle. Triggers the measurement process using the provided seed. Collapses the state.
18. `measureStateUserTriggered(uint256 userProvidedSeed)`: Allows *any* address to trigger the measurement process using their own seed. Less trustworthy for sensitive applications than an oracle-provided seed. Collapses the state.
19. `getStateAmplitude(uint256 basisStateIndex)`: Public view function to get the amplitude of a specific basis state.
20. `getTotalAmplitudeSum()`: Public view function to get the current total sum of all amplitudes.
21. `getMeasurementOutcome()`: Public view function to get the basis state index that resulted from the last measurement. Returns 0 if not measured or if measurement yielded no amplitude.
22. `isStateMeasured()`: Public view function to check if the state has been measured and collapsed.
23. `getProbability(uint256 basisStateIndex)`: Public view function to calculate the simulated probability (in parts per 10000) of measuring a specific basis state based on current amplitudes. Returns 0 if state is measured or total sum is zero.
24. `getOracleAddress()`: Public view function to get the configured oracle address.
25. `getLastMeasurementSeed()`: Public view function to get the seed used in the last measurement.
26. `getZKVerifierContract()`: Public view function to get the configured ZK verifier contract address.
27. `submitProofOfStateProperty(uint256 propertyType, bytes memory proofData)`: Placeholder function allowing submission of data potentially including a ZK proof about a state property. Emits an event.
28. `verifyStatePropertyProof(uint256 proofType, bytes memory publicInputs, bytes memory proof)`: Placeholder function. Assumes interaction with `zkVerifierContract` to verify a ZK proof (`proof`) given public inputs (`publicInputs`) for a specific `proofType`. Emits `ProofVerified` on simulated success. **Note:** Actual ZK verification logic is complex and omitted here, requiring integration with a ZK library/precompile or a dedicated verifier contract.

        // *** Simplified Collapse (acknowledging iteration limit) ***

        // Let's model collapse by:
        // 1. Picking `chosenOutcome` (conceptually, using seed & sum).
        // 2. Storing the amplitude *of the chosen outcome* before collapse.
        // 3. Setting *all* amplitudes to 0 in the mapping, *except* the chosen one.
        // 4. Setting the total sum to the amplitude of the chosen one.
        // This still requires knowing which keys to zero out.

        // Let's refine: The outcome itself IS the key. We store its amplitude, zero others (conceptually),

        // A pragmatic approach: Store the list of states that had non-zero amplitude *before* measurement.
        // This list needs to be maintained during transformations. Adding this adds complexity.

        // Let's use a simplified simulation acknowledging this. The measurement process

        // (or maybe a fixed value like 1 if modelling probability collapse).

        // *** Final Simulated Measurement Logic ***
        // 1. Use seed to pick `chosenOutcome` (conceptual, depends on ideal iteration).
        // 2. Store `_stateAmplitudes[chosenOutcome]` as `outcomeAmplitude`.
        // 3. Set `lastMeasurementOutcome = chosenOutcome`.
        // 4. Set `lastMeasurementSeed = seed`.
        // 5. Set `isMeasured = true`.
        // 6. Set `_totalAmplitudeSum = outcomeAmplitude`.
        // (We skip explicit zeroing of other map entries due to gas, relying on `isMeasured` flag).

        // Placeholder for conceptual outcome selection:
        // In a real application needing trustless random selection, this would integrate with a VRF.
        // The value `chosenOutcome` would be deterministically derived from the seed and amplitudes.
        // This derivation is the hard part on-chain without iterating maps.

        // Simulating outcome selection: This is a weak point without a list of active states.
        // For this example, let's use a simplified method: iterate a limited range or use
        // `block.timestamp` and `seed` with keccak256 to get an index within a *potential* range.
        // This doesn't correctly model probability based on *current* amplitudes across sparse states.
        // Let's assume a helper function `_probabilisticallySelectOutcome(seed, sum)` exists
        // that ideally returns the chosen index.

        // Let's make the measurement logic symbolic.
        // A real implementation needs a method to iterate keys or uses oracle-provided outcome + verification.
        // For this contract, we assume `_probabilisticallySelectOutcome` returns a valid key that had non-zero amplitude.

        // Example of a *possible* (but inefficient/limited) probabilistic selection:
        uint256 winningValue = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(seed, block.timestamp, block.chainid))) % sumBeforeMeasurement;
        uint256 currentCumulative = 0;

        // We *cannot* efficiently iterate `_stateAmplitudes`.
        // The conceptual code would look like:
        /*
        for each basisState in _stateAmplitudes.keys() (impossible):

     *      a sophisticated off-chain prover and an on-chain verifier implementation
     *      (e.g., Groth16, Plonk, etc.).
     * @param proofType The type of proof (e.g., identifier for the proving circuit).
     * @param publicInputs The public inputs for the ZK proof (depends on the circuit).
     * @param proof The ZK proof bytes.
     * @return success True if verification is successful, false otherwise (simulated).
