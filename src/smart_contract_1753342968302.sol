Here's a smart contract written in Solidity, incorporating interesting, advanced, creative, and trendy concepts related to decentralized computation, privacy (via ZKPs), and self-optimizing protocol mechanics. It aims to be unique by combining these elements in a specific marketplace model, rather than duplicating existing open-source projects for individual components.

# CognitoCompute Protocol

## Outline

This contract, `CognitoCompute`, establishes a decentralized marketplace for verifiable and private computations. It leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to allow solvers to prove computation correctness without revealing sensitive inputs or methods. The protocol includes mechanisms for reputation management and a self-optimizing treasury to ensure network health and efficiency.

*   **I. Core Protocol Management:** Handles general administration, contract pausing, and fee collection/withdrawal.
*   **II. ZK Circuit Registry:** Manages the registration and lifecycle of different ZK circuits (i.e., types of verifiable computations) the protocol supports.
*   **III. Computation Task Lifecycle:** Governs the creation, funding, cancellation, and updates of computation tasks by requesters.
*   **IV. Solver Management & Proof Verification:** Manages solver registration, enables the submission of ZK proofs, and handles the verification and rewarding process.
*   **V. Reputation and Incentive Mechanisms:** Implements a dynamic reputation system for solvers, including configurable weights for successes, failures, and dispute outcomes, as well as a reputation decay mechanism.
*   **VI. Protocol Treasury & Self-Optimization:** Manages the protocol's treasury, allowing for deposits, and implements an adaptive bounty mechanism to incentivize the completion of underperforming tasks using treasury funds, along with a proposal system for treasury spending.

## Function Summary

**I. Core Protocol Management:**

1.  `constructor(address _bountyToken)`: Initializes the contract, setting the owner and the ERC20 token to be used for bounties and treasury management.
2.  `updateProtocolFee(uint256 newFeeBps)`: Allows the owner to adjust the protocol fee, charged on task bounties, in basis points.
3.  `withdrawProtocolFees(address recipient)`: Enables the owner to withdraw accumulated protocol fees to a specified address.
4.  `pause()`: Pauses core contract functionalities, useful for emergency situations.
5.  `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract, resuming normal operations.

**II. ZK Circuit Registry:**

6.  `registerZKCircuit(bytes32 circuitId, bytes memory verificationKey)`: Registers a new ZK circuit by associating a unique ID with its verification key, enabling support for new types of private computations.
7.  `deregisterZKCircuit(bytes32 circuitId)`: Removes a previously registered ZK circuit.
8.  `getZKCircuit(bytes32 circuitId)`: Retrieves the verification key bytes for a given registered circuit ID.

**III. Computation Task Lifecycle:**

9.  `createComputationTask(bytes32 circuitId, bytes32 inputHash, uint256 bounty, uint256 maxExecutionTime, bytes memory taskMetadata)`: Allows a requester to create and fund a new computation task, specifying the required ZK circuit, a hash of private inputs, the bounty, and execution time limits.
10. `cancelComputationTask(uint256 taskId)`: Enables a requester to cancel their own task if it has not yet been assigned or solved, refunding the bounty.
11. `updateTaskBounty(uint256 taskId, uint256 newBounty)`: Allows a requester to increase the bounty for an existing task to make it more attractive to solvers.
12. `getTaskDetails(uint256 taskId)`: Provides detailed information about a specific computation task.

**IV. Solver Management & Proof Verification:**

13. `registerSolver()`: Allows any address to register as a solver, gaining the ability to submit proofs and earn bounties.
14. `deregisterSolver()`: Allows a registered solver to remove their registration.
15. `submitComputationProof(uint256 taskId, bytes memory proof, bytes32 outputHash)`: A registered solver submits a ZKP and the hash of the computed output for a task. The contract verifies the proof and processes the bounty payment.
16. `challengeProof(uint256 taskId, bytes32 allegedCorrectOutputHash)`: Allows a third party to challenge a submitted proof by providing what they believe is the correct output hash, triggering a resolution process that impacts solver and challenger reputation.

**V. Reputation and Incentive Mechanisms:**

17. `getSolverReputation(address solverAddress)`: Retrieves the current reputation score of a specified solver.
18. `setReputationDecayPeriod(uint256 decayPeriod)`: Sets the time period after which a solver's reputation will begin to decay due to inactivity.
19. `configureReputationWeights(int256 successWeight, int256 failureWeight, int256 challengeSuccessWeight, int256 challengeFailureWeight)`: Configures how different outcomes (successful proof, failed verification, successful challenge against solver, failed challenge by challenger) impact solver reputation.
20. `recomputeSolverReputation(address solverAddress)`: Manually triggers an update to a solver's reputation, applying any due decay.

**VI. Protocol Treasury & Self-Optimization:**

21. `depositToTreasury(uint256 amount)`: Allows any user to contribute funds to the protocol's treasury (in the designated bounty token).
22. `activateAdaptiveBountyMechanism(bool activate)`: Toggles the automated adaptive bounty mechanism, which can increase bounties on tasks that are underperforming.
23. `setAdaptiveBountyParams(uint256 activationThreshold, uint256 increasePercentage)`: Configures the parameters for the adaptive bounty mechanism, including the time threshold for "underperforming" tasks and the percentage increase.
24. `adjustBountyForUnderperformingTasks(uint256[] calldata taskIds)`: A callable function (e.g., by a keeper bot) that checks specified tasks and, if they meet the underperforming criteria and the adaptive mechanism is active, increases their bounties from the protocol treasury.
25. `initiateTreasurySpendingProposal(uint256 amount, address targetAddress, bytes memory callData, string memory description)`: Enables the owner to propose spending funds from the protocol treasury for operations, upgrades, or other initiatives.
26. `finalizeTreasurySpendingProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes an approved treasury spending proposal.
27. `getProtocolTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current liquid balance of the protocol treasury, excluding protocol fees awaiting withdrawal.
