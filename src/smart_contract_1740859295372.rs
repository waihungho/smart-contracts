/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Impact Investing
 * @author Bard (AI Language Model)
 * @notice This smart contract implements a DAO for impact investing, focusing on transparent and community-driven funding of sustainable projects. It introduces several innovative features:
 *   - **Dynamic Quadratic Funding (DQF):**  Adjusts matching fund allocation based on both individual contribution *and* project impact score.  Projects with higher impact and widespread support receive a disproportionately larger share of the matching funds.
 *   - **Impact Score Oracle Integration:**  Allows for integration with external oracles that provide objective impact scores for proposed projects.  These scores can be updated periodically.
 *   - **Tokenized Impact Credits (TICs):**  Investors receive TICs representing their share in the impact generated by funded projects. These tokens can be used for governance, staking, or traded on secondary markets.
 *   - **Permissioned Proposal Submission with KYC:**  Only KYC-verified users can submit proposals, enhancing the quality and accountability of projects listed.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Quadratic Funding (DQF):**  The core innovation.  The `calculateDynamicQuadraticFunding` function computes a quadratic funding amount, but importantly, it *multiplies* the result by the project's `impactScore` (scaled using `impactScoreMultiplier`). This means projects with both high community support (quadratic funding) AND a high impact score from the oracle get a disproportionately larger share of the matching funds.  This incentivizes funding of *effective* projects.  The sqrt function is included to provide a basic quadratic funding calculation.
* **Impact Score Oracle Integration:** The `updateImpactScore` function, callable *only* by the `impactScoreOracleAddress`, allows the DAO to receive objectively verifiable impact scores for projects.  Crucially, the `impactScoreOracleAddress` can be a complex oracle network or a trusted third party providing verified data.
* **Tokenized Impact Credits (TICs):** The `ImpactCredit` token (`impactToken`) represents an investor's stake in the positive impact generated by the project.  This adds another layer of incentive and allows for potential secondary markets or further governance rights based on impact ownership. The claimImpactCredits function allows investors to claim their Impact Credits upon project completion.
* **KYC Verification:** The `onlyKYCVerified` modifier enforces that only users who have passed KYC can submit proposals, helping to ensure higher quality projects and reduce spam.  The `KYCContract` is a mock for demonstration purposes; a real implementation would need to integrate with a suitable KYC/AML provider.  I've kept it simple for illustrative clarity.
* **Voting Mechanism:** Includes basic voting functionality with "For" and "Against" options, and a minimum stake requirement to participate in governance, preventing sybil attacks.
* **ReentrancyGuard:**  The `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin prevents reentrancy attacks, which are a common vulnerability in smart contracts that handle token transfers.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Includes require statements to check for invalid inputs and prevent unexpected behavior.
* **Events:** Emits events to track key actions within the contract, making it easier to monitor and audit.
* **Admin Functions:** Includes admin functions to manage the contract, such as setting the KYC contract address, Impact Score Oracle address, minimum stake, voting duration, and recover accidentally sent ERC20 tokens.
* **Clear Structure and Comments:** The code is well-structured and commented to improve readability and understanding.
* **Ownable:**  Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract for basic ownership management and control.
* **SafeMath:** Employs OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow errors.

**How it works:**

1. **Proposal Submission:**  KYC-verified users submit project proposals with details including title, description, funding goal, start and end times.
2. **Funding:** Users contribute governance tokens to projects they believe in.
3. **Impact Score Update:** The `ImpactScoreOracle` periodically updates the impact scores of proposals.
4. **Voting:** Users with enough staked governance tokens can vote for or against a project proposal.
5. **Execution:** If a project meets its funding goal and receives more "For" votes than "Against" votes, it's executed, and the funds are transferred to the proposer.
6. **Matching Fund Distribution:** After execution, the DAO owner can trigger the `distributeMatchingFunds` function.  This calculates the DQF amount, taking into account individual contributions and the project's impact score.  The higher the impact score, the more matching funds the project receives.
7. **Impact Credit Claim:**  Investors can claim their share of `ImpactCredit` tokens, representing their stake in the impact generated by the project.

**To deploy and use this contract:**

1. **Deploy Governance Token:**  Deploy an ERC20 token that will be used for governance and funding.
2. **Deploy KYC Contract:**  Deploy a (mock) KYC contract for testing or integrate with a real KYC provider.
3. **Deploy Impact Score Oracle:** Deploy a (mock) Impact Score Oracle.
4. **Deploy ImpactDAO:**  Deploy the `ImpactDAO` contract, providing the addresses of the governance token, KYC contract, and Impact Score Oracle.  Also, set the `minimumStake` and `votingDuration`.
5. **KYC Verification:**  Use the KYC contract to verify users who will submit proposals.
6. **Deposit Matching Funds:**  The DAO owner deposits governance tokens into the `matchingFundPool`.
7. **Create Proposals:**  KYC-verified users create proposals.
8. **Fund Proposals:**  Users fund the proposals.
9. **Update Impact Scores:** The `ImpactScoreOracle` updates the impact scores for each proposal.
10. **Vote on Proposals:**  Users vote on the proposals.
11. **Execute and Distribute:**  Once the funding goal is met and the voting period is over, the owner calls `distributeMatchingFunds` to allocate matching funds.  The project proposer receives the funding, and the project is marked as complete.
12. **Claim Impact Credits:** Investors claim their impact credits.

This comprehensive design provides a solid foundation for a truly decentralized and impact-driven investment DAO.  Remember to thoroughly test this contract and audit it for potential vulnerabilities before deploying it to a production environment.  The mock KYC and Oracle contracts *must* be replaced with real, secure implementations.
