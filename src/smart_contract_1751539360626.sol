Okay, let's design a smart contract that acts as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on funding, managing, and verifying **Decentralized Research Projects**. This incorporates concepts like role-based access, milestone-based funding, staking for commitment, reputation scoring, and decentralized data references (via CIDs). It's more complex than a simple token or voting contract and combines several trendy ideas.

We'll aim for 20+ distinct functions covering various aspects of the research DAO lifecycle.

## Decentralized Autonomous Researcher DAO

**Outline:**

1.  **Purpose:** A DAO to manage and fund decentralized research projects, allowing members to propose, vote on, fund, execute, and validate research output.
2.  **Roles:** Defines roles for members (Researcher, Validator, Funder, Governance).
3.  **Membership:** Manages member lifecycle (joining, approval, leaving).
4.  **Treasury:** Handles incoming funds and project payouts.
5.  **Research Projects:** Struct defines project details, milestones, status, and associated data.
6.  **Project Lifecycle:** Functions cover proposal, voting, funding, execution (milestone submission), validation, and finalization.
7.  **Staking:** Researchers stake collateral for projects.
8.  **Reputation:** Tracks member contributions and success (conceptually via a score/internal points, could be linked to SBTs).
9.  **Governance:** Core functions for DAO control, project approval, and dispute resolution.
10. **AI/Data Integration (Conceptual):** Placeholders/mechanisms for linking off-chain AI analysis or data verification requests.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the DAO, setting the initial governance member.
2.  `joinDAO(string memory _motivationCID)`: Allows anyone to submit a proposal to join the DAO, including a link (CID) to their motivation/qualifications.
3.  `approveMembershipProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Governance approves a membership proposal, making the proposer an active member.
4.  `rejectMembershipProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Governance rejects a membership proposal.
5.  `grantRole(address _member, Role _role)`: Governance assigns a specific role (Researcher, Validator, Funder) to a member.
6.  `revokeRole(address _member, Role _role)`: Governance removes a role from a member.
7.  `leaveDAO()`: Allows an active member to leave the DAO.
8.  `depositFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit Ether into the DAO treasury.
9.  `withdrawFunds(uint256 _amount)`: Governance withdraws funds from the treasury.
10. `submitResearchProposal(string memory _title, string memory _descriptionCID, uint256 _totalBudget, uint256 _stakeRequired, uint256[] memory _milestoneBudgets, uint256[] memory _milestoneValidationQuorums)`: A Researcher submits a new research project proposal with budget, stake, milestones, and validation requirements.
11. `stakeForProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: A Researcher stakes the required amount to activate their research proposal for voting/funding.
12. `voteOnResearchProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Active members vote on staked research proposals.
13. `approveResearchProject(uint256 _proposalId)`: Governance approves a research proposal based on voting results and available funds, converting it into an active project.
14. `fundProject(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows Funders (or anyone if allowed) to contribute specific funds to an approved project.
15. `submitMilestoneReport(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, string memory _reportCID)`: The designated Researcher submits a report for a completed milestone, linking to the findings (CID).
16. `voteOnMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, bool _verified)`: Validators vote on whether a submitted milestone report is satisfactory.
17. `verifyMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: Governance finalizes the milestone verification based on validator votes and quorum, potentially releasing funds.
18. `claimMilestoneReward(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: The Researcher claims the reward for a successfully verified milestone.
19. `disputeMilestoneVerification(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, string memory _reasonCID)`: A Researcher or Validator can formally dispute the outcome of a milestone verification, triggering governance review.
20. `submitFinalResearchResult(uint256 _projectId, string memory _resultCID)`: The Researcher submits the final results of the project.
21. `voteOnFinalResult(uint256 _projectId, bool _verified)`: Validators vote on the final research result.
22. `finalizeProject(uint256 _projectId)`: Governance finalizes the project based on validator votes, potentially distributing final rewards and releasing stakes.
23. `cancelProject(uint256 _projectId, string memory _reasonCID)`: Governance cancels a project (e.g., failure, inactivity), handling stakes and funds.
24. `unstakeFromCancelledProject(uint256 _projectId)`: Researcher reclaims part/all of their stake if a project is cancelled under certain conditions (governance decision).
25. `proposeGovernanceAction(string memory _descriptionCID, bytes memory _callData)`: Allows members (or specific roles) to propose complex governance actions (e.g., changing parameters, calling arbitrary functions).
26. `voteOnGovernanceAction(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on governance proposals.
27. `executeGovernanceAction(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved and passed governance proposal.
28. `getMemberReputationScore(address _member)`: Retrieves the calculated reputation score for a member (based on successful projects, validations, etc.). (Internal calculation based on events/state).
29. `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Allows a member to delegate their voting power for proposals to another member.
