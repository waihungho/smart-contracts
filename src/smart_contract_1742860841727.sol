/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Investment Fund (DAIF) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Investment Fund (DAIF).
 *      This contract allows users to deposit funds, participate in governance, propose and vote on investment strategies,
 *      manage risk through circuit breakers and emergency withdrawals, and transparently track fund performance.
 *      It incorporates advanced concepts like decentralized governance, dynamic strategy allocation, and community-driven investment decisions.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Fund Management:**
 *    - depositFunds(): Allow users to deposit funds into the DAIF.
 *    - withdrawFunds(): Allow users to withdraw their funds (subject to withdrawal limits and governance).
 *    - getAccountBalance(): View individual user's balance in the fund.
 *    - getFundTotalBalance(): View the total balance of the fund.
 *    - setWithdrawalFee(): Set a withdrawal fee percentage (governance controlled).
 *    - getWithdrawalFee(): View the current withdrawal fee percentage.
 *
 * 2. **Governance & Proposals:**
 *    - createInvestmentProposal(): Allow token holders to propose new investment strategies.
 *    - voteOnProposal(): Allow token holders to vote on active investment proposals.
 *    - executeProposal(): Execute a passed investment proposal (strategy activation/deactivation).
 *    - getProposalStatus(): View the status of a specific investment proposal.
 *    - setVotingDuration(): Set the duration of voting periods for proposals (governance controlled).
 *    - getVotingDuration(): View the current voting duration.
 *    - setQuorumThreshold(): Set the quorum threshold for proposal approval (governance controlled).
 *    - getQuorumThreshold(): View the current quorum threshold.
 *
 * 3. **Investment Strategy Management:**
 *    - addInvestmentStrategy(): Add a new investment strategy (governance controlled).
 *    - removeInvestmentStrategy(): Remove an existing investment strategy (governance controlled).
 *    - activateInvestmentStrategy(): Activate a specific investment strategy for fund allocation (governance controlled via proposals).
 *    - deactivateInvestmentStrategy(): Deactivate a specific investment strategy (governance controlled via proposals).
 *    - getAllInvestmentStrategies(): View a list of all registered investment strategies.
 *    - getActiveInvestmentStrategies(): View a list of currently active investment strategies.
 *    - allocateFundsToStrategy(): (Internal) Function to allocate fund balance to active strategies (automated or governance-triggered).
 *
 * 4. **Risk Management & Emergency Controls:**
 *    - setCircuitBreakerThreshold(): Set a percentage threshold for fund balance drop to trigger a circuit breaker (governance controlled).
 *    - getCircuitBreakerThreshold(): View the current circuit breaker threshold.
 *    - triggerEmergencyWithdrawal(): Initiate an emergency withdrawal process (governance controlled under extreme conditions).
 *    - isCircuitBreakerActive(): Check if the circuit breaker is currently active.
 *
 * 5. **Tokenomics & Rewards (Optional - Can be extended):**
 *    - distributeRewards(): Distribute rewards to fund participants (e.g., based on fund performance or staking - could be a future enhancement).
 *
 * 6. **Transparency & Auditability:**
 *    - getTransactionHistory(): View the transaction history of the fund (deposits, withdrawals, strategy allocations).
 *    - getFundPerformance(): View overall fund performance metrics (e.g., ROI, APY - would require integration with external data oracles for real-world asset values).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - **Fund Management:**  Handles user deposits, withdrawals, and balance tracking.
 * - **Governance & Proposals:** Implements a DAO-like governance system for investment decisions through proposals and voting.
 * - **Investment Strategy Management:**  Manages the registration, activation, and deactivation of investment strategies.
 * - **Risk Management & Emergency Controls:**  Incorporates mechanisms to mitigate risk and handle extreme market conditions.
 * - **Tokenomics & Rewards:** (Placeholder for future reward mechanisms).
 * - **Transparency & Auditability:** Provides functions for tracking fund activity and performance.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Investment Fund (DAIF) Concept:** The contract embodies the idea of a community-governed investment fund, moving away from centralized management.

2.  **Governance via Proposals and Voting:**
    *   **Proposal System:** Users (token holders in a real-world DAO, or just anyone in this example) can create proposals for key fund actions like adding/removing/activating/deactivating investment strategies and setting parameters.
    *   **Voting Mechanism:**  A simple voting system is implemented where token holders can vote "yes" or "no" on proposals.  The quorum threshold ensures that a sufficient percentage of the voting power is reached for a proposal to pass.
    *   **Voting Duration:** The voting period is configurable, allowing for adjustments based on governance needs.

3.  **Investment Strategy Management:**
    *   **Strategy Registry:** The contract maintains a registry of investment strategies, each with a name, description, and potentially a smart contract address (for future integration with external DeFi protocols or automated strategies).
    *   **Strategy Activation/Deactivation:**  Investment strategies can be activated or deactivated through governance proposals, allowing the community to dynamically adjust the fund's investment approach.
    *   **Fund Allocation (Placeholder):** The `allocateFundsToStrategy()` function is a placeholder. In a real DAIF, this function would contain the complex logic to distribute the fund's capital across the active investment strategies. This could involve interacting with external DeFi protocols, executing trades, managing risk parameters per strategy, etc.

4.  **Risk Management - Circuit Breaker and Emergency Withdrawal:**
    *   **Circuit Breaker:**  A circuit breaker mechanism is implemented. If the fund's total balance drops below a certain percentage threshold (configurable by governance), the circuit breaker can be triggered (or automatically triggered in a more advanced version). This could halt certain fund operations to prevent further losses.
    *   **Emergency Withdrawal:**  In extreme situations (e.g., a major market crash, critical vulnerability discovered), governance can trigger an emergency withdrawal process. This function is a placeholder and would need to be fleshed out with specific logic for how users would withdraw funds in an emergency scenario.

5.  **Transparency and Auditability:**
    *   **Events:** The contract emits events for key actions (deposits, withdrawals, proposals, votes, strategy changes, etc.). Events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and building user interfaces to track fund activity.
    *   **View Functions:** Functions like `getAccountBalance()`, `getFundTotalBalance()`, `getProposalStatus()`, `getAllInvestmentStrategies()`, `getActiveInvestmentStrategies()`, `getVotingDuration()`, `getQuorumThreshold()`, `getCircuitBreakerThreshold()`, and `isCircuitBreakerActive()` provide transparency into the fund's state and parameters.
    *   **Transaction History and Performance (Placeholders):** `getTransactionHistory()` and `getFundPerformance()` are placeholders.  Real-world implementations would require more sophisticated mechanisms (likely off-chain indexing of events and integration with data oracles) to provide detailed transaction history and performance metrics.

6.  **Advanced Concepts and Trends Incorporated:**
    *   **DAO Principles:** Decentralized governance, community-driven decision-making.
    *   **Dynamic Strategy Allocation:** The ability to change investment strategies based on market conditions or community consensus.
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Circuit breaker and emergency withdrawal mechanisms address potential risks in volatile crypto markets.
    *   **Transparency and Auditability:** Focus on providing clear information about fund operations.

7.  **Non-Duplication of Open Source (as requested):** While the concepts are inspired by DeFi and DAO principles, the specific combination of features and the structure of this contract are designed to be unique and not a direct copy of any single open-source project.  It's a conceptual framework demonstrating advanced smart contract capabilities.

**Important Notes for Real-World Use:**

*   **Security Audits:**  Before deploying any smart contract like this to a production environment, it is absolutely critical to have it thoroughly audited by reputable security experts. DeFi contracts are high-value targets for exploits.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  For complex logic like strategy allocation and parameter setting via proposals, gas optimization is crucial to make the contract efficient and cost-effective to use.
*   **External Interactions:** The `allocateFundsToStrategy()` function and strategy contract integration are placeholders.  A real DAIF would need robust and secure integration with external DeFi protocols, DEXes, or other smart contracts to execute investment strategies. This would involve careful interface design, error handling, and security considerations for interacting with external systems.
*   **Data Oracles:**  For features like `getFundPerformance()` and potentially for dynamic strategy allocation that depends on market data, integration with reliable data oracles is essential to bring real-world information onto the blockchain.
*   **DAO Framework Integration:** For a truly decentralized governance system, consider integrating with established DAO frameworks (like Aragon, Snapshot, Governor Bravo from OpenZeppelin, etc.) instead of a simplified `onlyGovernance` owner-based model.
*   **Tokenomics Design:**  For a real DAIF, careful design of the fund's tokenomics (if it has its own governance token) is critical for incentivizing participation, aligning incentives, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO.

This contract provides a foundation and a conceptual blueprint. Building a production-ready DAIF would require significant further development, security hardening, and integration with a broader DeFi ecosystem.
