Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts without being a direct copy of standard open-source projects.

We'll create a contract called `QuantumTrustResolver`. The concept is a decentralized system for resolving subjective or uncertain claims based on staked reputation, submitted evidence, collective endorsements, and simulated interaction with futuristic/advanced concepts like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Oracles representing complex external data/computation. The "Quantum" aspect loosely represents the state of a claim being uncertain until it's "observed" or "collapsed" into a resolved state through various inputs.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Reputation Staking:** Users stake ETH/tokens to gain reputation, which influences the weight of their actions.
2.  **Claim Creation:** Users propose claims about future events or states, staking funds on a predicted outcome.
3.  **Evidence Submission:** Users submit references (hashes) to evidence supporting one side of a claim, staking funds.
4.  **Reputation-Weighted Endorsements:** Users endorse claims or evidence, using their staked reputation to add weight.
5.  **ZK Proof Simulation:** The contract simulates verification of ZK proofs submitted by users, adding a strong signal for resolution if verified.
6.  **Oracle Simulation:** The contract simulates receiving data from a complex oracle (perhaps representing AI analysis or quantum computation outcome), which can trigger resolution.
7.  **Multiple Resolution Paths:** Claims can be resolved based on:
    *   Internal consensus (weighted sum of endorsements + evidence stake).
    *   Simulated Oracle data.
    *   Simulated ZK Proof verification success.
    *   Manual resolution by a trusted entity (e.g., owner in this simplified version, but could be a DAO).
    *   Expiry.
8.  **Challenge Mechanism:** Users can challenge claims or resolutions, potentially forcing a dispute state.
9.  **Dynamic Stakes & Rewards:** Stakes are distributed based on the final resolved outcome and contributions (evidence, endorsement, challenges).
