Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for an advanced NFT Investment Fund. It combines concepts like pooled capital, fractional ownership (via shares), NFT management, a flexible (potentially oracle-driven) valuation mechanism, multi-currency support, and manager-controlled operations with features like pausing and emergency withdrawal.

It's designed to be complex and feature-rich, going beyond basic token or NFT contracts. It also abstracts away the complexities of *external* marketplace interactions, focusing on the fund's internal logic, asset holding, and valuation.

/**
 * @title NFTFundManager
 * @dev A smart contract representing a decentralized NFT investment fund.
 * Investors contribute accepted currencies (ETH or ERC20) and receive shares
 * of the fund (represented by an ERC20 token). The fund manager uses the
 * pooled capital to acquire NFTs. The fund's value is tracked based on
 * token balances and NFT valuations, which can be set by a manager or an oracle.
 * Investors can redeem shares based on the fund's value.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Variables & Data Structures: Core data like manager, shares, assets, valuations.
 * 2. Events: Signalling important actions (Invest, Redeem, Buy, Sell, etc.).
 * 3. Access Control: Modifiers for restricting function calls (onlyManager, whenNotPaused).
 * 4. Constructor: Initializes the fund manager, share token, and initial parameters.
 * 5. Currency Management: Functions to add/remove accepted deposit currencies.
 * 6. Investment: Functions for investors to deposit ETH or ERC20 and receive shares.
 * 7. Withdrawal/Redemption: Functions for investors to redeem shares for fund assets.
 * 8. NFT Handling:
 *    - Callbacks for receiving ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
 *    - Internal tracking of owned NFTs.
 *    - Function for manager to transfer NFTs out (e.g., for sale or distribution).
 * 9. Asset Management: Function for manager to transfer accepted currencies out (e.g., for purchases, fees).
 * 10. Valuation:
 *     - Mechanism to set/update individual NFT values (manager or oracle).
 *     - Tracking of total fund value.
 *     - Functions to get asset/fund/share values.
 * 11. Fund Operations: Pausing, Emergency Withdrawal.
 * 12. View Functions: For querying state (balances, owned NFTs, settings).
 *
 * Advanced Concepts Used:
 * - NFT Fund: Pooling capital to invest in non-fungible assets.
 * - Fractional Ownership: Representing fund ownership with an ERC20 share token.
 * - Dynamic Valuation: Implementing a mechanism (simulated oracle/manager update)
 *   to track the changing value of illiquid NFT assets on-chain.
 * - Multi-currency Support: Accepting different types of tokens and ETH for investment.
 * - ERC-1155 Support: Handling both single (ERC721) and multiple (ERC1155) NFTs.
 * - Explicit Asset Control: Manager must explicitly manage assets coming in/out via designated functions.
 * - Pausable: Standard security mechanism.
 * - Emergency Withdrawal: Critical function for disaster recovery.
 *
 * Note on Valuation: Real-time, accurate, and decentralized NFT valuation on-chain
 * is a significant challenge. This contract provides a framework where valuation data
 * is provided either by a trusted manager or integrated via a separate oracle mechanism.
 * The `latestFundValue` state variable acts as the source of truth for redemptions,
 * requiring the manager or oracle to keep it updated. Iterating over potentially thousands
 * of owned NFTs to sum their values on-chain in a single transaction is often too gas-intensive,
 * hence the reliance on an updated total value.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Design Choices:**

1.  **NFT Fund Structure:** It's not just holding tokens; it's specifically designed to pool funds for NFT *investment*.
2.  **Fractional Ownership:** The use of a dedicated ERC20 `shareToken` makes the fund's underlying value (ETH, ERC20s, NFTs) fungible and divisible, allowing investors to own fractions of the overall portfolio.
3.  **Dynamic & External Valuation:** This is a critical and complex aspect of NFT funds.
    *   Instead of trying to calculate the value of every diverse NFT asset on-chain in real-time (which is prohibitively expensive and difficult), the contract uses a state variable `latestFundValue`.
    *   This value is intended to be updated by a trusted entity (`nftValuationOracle`, which could be the manager or a separate oracle contract/DAO).
    *   Individual NFT valuations can also be updated via `updateNFTValuation`, allowing granular tracking, but the *total* fund value for investment/redemption calculations (`latestFundValue`) relies on an external process aggregating these or other data.
    *   `getShareValue` derives its value directly from `latestFundValue`, making redemptions dependent on timely external valuation updates.
4.  **Multi-Currency Support:** The fund can accept investments in ETH and multiple different ERC20 tokens, managed via `acceptedCurrencies`.
5.  **ERC-1155 Handling:** Explicit support for the ERC-1155 standard alongside ERC-721 adds complexity and handles more diverse digital assets (e.g., multiple copies of the same artwork). The `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` callbacks are implemented.
6.  **Explicit Asset Management:** The manager uses dedicated functions (`transferNFTOut`, `transferAcceptedCurrencyOut`) to move assets out of the contract, providing clear audit trails for how fund assets are used (purchases, sales, fees, distributions).
7.  **Manager-Controlled Operations:** While not a full DAO, the `onlyManager` modifier centralizes control for key decisions (buying/selling/transferring assets, setting fees, updating value, pausing), simulating the operational aspect of a managed fund.
8.  **Internal NFT Tracking:** The `_ownedNFTs` and `_ownedNFTCounts` mappings track assets received by the contract, providing an internal inventory. `isNFTOwned` and `getNFTCountByCollection` offer visibility into these holdings. `_totalNFTCount` provides an aggregated count.
9.  **Separation of Concerns:** Investment/Redemption logic is separate from Asset Transfer logic. Valuation setting is separate from Investment/Redemption calculations, highlighting the different roles and processes involved.
10. **Emergency Withdrawal:** A crucial security feature for high-value contracts, allowing the manager to rescue fungible assets in case of unforeseen circumstances.

This contract provides a framework for a sophisticated on-chain fund interacting with non-fungible assets, while acknowledging and abstracting some of the most challenging aspects like real-time decentralized NFT valuation.
