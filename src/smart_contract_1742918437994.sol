/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @notice A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, featuring community-driven curation, dynamic exhibitions,
 * artist collaboration opportunities, fractional NFT ownership, and more.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -----------------
 * **Gallery Management:**
 * 1. initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _galleryOwner) - Initializes the gallery with a name and owner.
 * 2. setGalleryName(string _newName) - Allows the gallery owner to update the gallery name.
 * 3. setGalleryOwner(address _newOwner) - Allows the gallery owner to transfer ownership.
 * 4. pauseGallery() - Pauses core functionalities of the gallery.
 * 5. unpauseGallery() - Resumes paused functionalities.
 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 6. submitArt(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string _artTitle, string _artistName, string _description, string _ipfsHash) - Artists submit their NFTs for consideration.
 * 7. voteOnArt(uint256 _artId, bool _approve) - Community members vote to approve or reject submitted art.
 * 8. getArtSubmissionDetails(uint256 _artId) - Retrieves details of a specific art submission.
 * 9. setArtApprovalThreshold(uint256 _newThresholdPercentage) - Gallery owner sets the percentage of votes needed for art approval.
 * 10. withdrawRejectedArt(uint256 _artId) - Artists can withdraw their rejected art submissions.
 *
 * **Exhibition Management:**
 * 11. createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime) - Curators create new exhibitions with names and timeframes.
 * 12. addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId) - Curators add approved art pieces to an exhibition.
 * 13. removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId) - Curators remove art from an exhibition.
 * 14. startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId) - Starts a scheduled exhibition.
 * 15. endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId) - Ends an active exhibition.
 * 16. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId) - Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 *
 * **Artist Collaboration & Fractionalization:**
 * 17. requestCollaboration(uint256 _artId, address _collaboratorArtist) - Artists can request collaborations on their submitted art.
 * 18. respondToCollaborationRequest(uint256 _requestId, bool _accept) - Artists respond to collaboration requests.
 * 19. fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _numberOfFractions) - Gallery owner (or designated role) can fractionalize approved art into ERC1155 tokens.
 * 20. purchaseFraction(uint256 _fractionalArtId, uint256 _amount) - Users can purchase fractions of fractionalized art.
 *
 * **Community Features:**
 * 21. donateToGallery() payable - Users can donate ETH to support the gallery.
 * 22. proposeFeature(string _proposalDescription) - Community members can propose new gallery features.
 * 23. voteOnFeatureProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support) - Community members vote on feature proposals.
 * 24. withdrawGalleryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) - Gallery owner can withdraw funds (potentially subject to governance in a more advanced version).
 * 25. getGalleryBalance() - Retrieves the current ETH balance of the gallery contract.
