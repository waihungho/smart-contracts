Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Creating a truly novel and advanced concept in Solidity while avoiding open-source duplication and hitting 20+ functions requires combining several cutting-edge ideas.

I've designed a contract called **"QuantumSynth"** â€“ a Decentralized Predictive Asset Generation & Adaptive Intelligence Network.

**Core Concept:**
QuantumSynth is a protocol where users submit "predictive insights" about future events (e.g., market trends, technological advancements, environmental shifts). These insights are staked, evaluated for accuracy, and contribute to a collective "adaptive intelligence" layer. Based on the aggregated outcomes of these predictions, the contract can dynamically:
1.  **Synthesize Unique Digital Assets (Dynamic NFTs):** Trigger the creation or modification of NFTs whose properties or very existence depend on the verified future states predicted by the network.
2.  **Orchestrate Automated Actions:** Automatically propose or execute actions in connected decentralized systems (e.g., DAOs, GameFi, Metaverse) based on high-confidence aggregated predictions.

This goes beyond simple prediction markets by linking predictions to tangible *actionable outcomes* and *generative asset creation*, and it's not just a passive system but an *active intelligence* that can initiate processes.

## QuantumSynth: Decentralized Predictive Asset Generation & Adaptive Intelligence Network

### Outline:

1.  **Core Systems & Access Control:**
    *   Ownership, Pausability, Role Management.
2.  **QuantumSynth Token (QSYNTH):**
    *   Internal, minimal ERC-20 like implementation for staking and rewards.
3.  **Insight & Prediction Management:**
    *   Defining future-oriented "Insight Topics".
    *   Users submitting and staking on their "Insights" (predictions).
    *   Allowing insight retraction within a window.
4.  **Oracle & Resolution System:**
    *   Designated Oracles resolve Insight Topics with actual outcomes.
    *   Community challenge mechanism for Oracle resolutions, potentially triggering DAO votes.
5.  **Reputation & Reward System:**
    *   Non-transferable reputation score based on insight accuracy.
    *   Distribution of QSYNTH rewards to accurate predictors; slashing for inaccurate ones.
6.  **Dynamic Asset Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Defining "Asset Blueprints" with conditions tied to aggregated insight outcomes.
    *   User-initiated synthesis of unique digital assets (simulated dynamic NFTs).
    *   Mechanism to update asset metadata based on ongoing network intelligence.
7.  **Adaptive Intelligence & DAO Orchestration:**
    *   Aggregating resolved topic outcomes into a "collective intelligence".
    *   The contract *proactively* generating DAO proposals or executing pre-approved automated actions based on this intelligence.
8.  **External System Interaction Hooks:**
    *   Registers external contracts (e.g., GameFi, other DAOs) for potential interaction.

### Function Summary:

1.  **`constructor()`**: Initializes contract owner, deploys/links QSYNTH token (minimal internal impl.).
2.  **`pause()` / `unpause()`**: Owner can pause/unpause critical functions for maintenance.
3.  **`transferOwnership(address newOwner)`**: Transfers contract ownership.
4.  **`addOracle(address _oracle)`**: Grants address `_oracle` the Oracle role.
5.  **`removeOracle(address _oracle)`**: Revokes Oracle role.
6.  **`mintQSYNTH(address _to, uint256 _amount)`**: Internal function for reward distribution.
7.  **`burnQSYNTH(address _from, uint256 _amount)`**: Internal function for slashing.
8.  **`defineInsightTopic(bytes32 _topicHash, string memory _description, uint256 _predictionWindowEnd, uint256 _resolutionWindowEnd, address _resolutionOracle)`**: Creates a new topic for predictions.
9.  **`submitInsight(bytes32 _topicHash, bytes32 _insightDataHash, uint256 _stakeAmount)`**: Users submit a prediction (as a hash of off-chain data) and stake QSYNTH.
10. **`retractInsight(bytes32 _topicHash, uint256 _insightId)`**: Allows a user to retract their insight before prediction window closes, with a small penalty.
11. **`resolveInsightTopic(bytes32 _topicHash, bytes32 _actualOutcomeHash)`**: Oracle submits the actual outcome for a topic.
12. **`challengeResolution(bytes32 _topicHash, bytes32 _proposedOutcomeHash)`**: Allows users to challenge an oracle's resolution, staking QSYNTH.
13. **`voteOnResolutionChallenge(bytes32 _topicHash, bool _approve)`**: QSYNTH holders (or reputation holders) vote on challenged resolutions.
14. **`distributeRewards(bytes32 _topicHash)`**: Calculates and distributes QSYNTH rewards based on insight accuracy.
15. **`claimRewards(bytes32 _topicHash)`**: Allows users to claim their QSYNTH rewards and updates reputation.
16. **`getReputation(address _user)`**: Returns a user's non-transferable reputation score.
17. **`defineAssetBlueprint(bytes32 _blueprintHash, string memory _name, string memory _symbol, string memory _baseURI, uint256 _requiredReputation, uint256 _qsynthCost, bytes32[] memory _triggerTopicHashes, address _generationLogicContract)`**: Creates a blueprint for a dynamic asset/NFT.
18. **`synthesizeAsset(bytes32 _blueprintHash)`**: Users initiate asset synthesis. Mints a unique asset if their reputation, QSYNTH balance, and aggregated insight outcomes match the blueprint's criteria.
19. **`updateAssetMetadata(uint256 _assetId, string memory _newURI)`**: Allows the contract itself to update the metadata of an already synthesized asset, based on new aggregated intelligence.
20. **`registerExternalSystem(string memory _systemName, address _systemAddress)`**: Registers an address of an external contract (e.g., a GameFi land contract, another DAO).
21. **`aggregateTopicOutcomes(bytes32 _topicHash)`**: Internal function to process all insights for a topic and determine the "collective intelligence" outcome (weighted consensus).
22. **`triggerDAOProposal(bytes32 _topicHash, bytes32 _aggregatedOutcome, address _targetContract, bytes memory _callData)`**: The contract *proposes* an action to a registered external DAO based on an aggregated outcome.
23. **`executeAutomatedAction(bytes32 _topicHash, bytes32 _aggregatedOutcome, address _targetContract, bytes memory _callData)`**: For pre-approved scenarios, the contract *automatically executes* an action on an external system.
24. **`getAggregatedOutcome(bytes32 _topicHash)`**: Returns the QuantumSynth network's "collective belief" for a topic.
25. **`getPendingRewards(address _user, bytes32 _topicHash)`**: View pending rewards for a user on a specific topic.
26. **`getQSYNTHBalance(address _user)`**: Returns the QSYNTH token balance for a user.
