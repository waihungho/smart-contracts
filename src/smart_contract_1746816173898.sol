Okay, let's create a smart contract concept that blends elements of prediction markets, probabilistic outcomes, and asset swaps, incorporating randomness and distinct states. We'll call it "QuantumFluctuationSwap" (metaphorical "quantum" for probabilistic nature).

It allows users to swap two tokens based on the outcome of a future event, but the *exact* swap ratio is influenced by the correctness of their prediction *and* a pseudo-random factor determined at the time of resolution. Participants deposit tokens into a pool associated with a specific predicted event.

**Disclaimer:** Using `blockhash` for randomness in `calculateRandomFactor` is insecure in production environments as miners/validators can influence it. For real-world use, integrate a secure Verifiable Random Function (VRF) like Chainlink VRF. This contract is for illustrative purposes of complex logic.

### Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** QuantumFluctuationSwap

**Core Concept:** A decentralized platform where users predict the outcome of specific events and commit token pairs (Token A and Token B). After the event resolves, assets within the pool are redistributed among participants based on their prediction's correctness and a dynamically calculated, random-influenced swap ratio.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Prediction Events:** Admin creates events with a description and resolution time/block.
2.  **Fluctuation Pools:** Each event has a pool where users deposit tokens A and B and state their prediction (Yes/No).
3.  **Probabilistic Swap:** After resolution, a random factor influences a multiplier range applied to correct vs. incorrect predictions, determining each participant's final share of the pool's total assets.
4.  **Claiming:** Users claim their final calculated share of tokens A and B after the swap logic is triggered for the event.
5.  **Roles:** Owner (admin), Resolver (can resolve events, potentially granted by owner).
6.  **Fees:** Optional protocol fee on the total value swapped or profits.

**Function Summary (24 Functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with owner, Token A, and Token B addresses.
2.  `createPredictionEvent()`: (Admin/Owner) Creates a new prediction event.
3.  `cancelPredictionEvent()`: (Admin/Owner) Cancels an unresolved event, allowing participants to withdraw.
4.  `updatePredictionEventResolutionTime()`: (Admin/Owner) Modifies the resolution time for an event before it passes.
5.  `grantResolverRole()`: (Owner) Grants permission to an address to resolve prediction events.
6.  `removeResolverRole()`: (Owner) Revokes resolver permission from an address.
7.  `isResolver()`: (View) Checks if an address has the resolver role.
8.  `setFeeRecipient()`: (Admin/Owner) Sets the address to receive protocol fees.
9.  `setProtocolFeeBps()`: (Admin/Owner) Sets the protocol fee percentage (in basis points).
10. `withdrawProtocolFees()`: (Admin/Owner) Allows the fee recipient to withdraw collected fees.
11. `enterFluctuationPool()`: User commits Token A and Token B to a pool and makes a prediction (Yes/No). Requires prior token approval.
12. `exitFluctuationPoolPreResolution()`: User exits a pool before resolution, withdrawing their initial stake (potentially with a penalty/fee, though not implemented here for simplicity).
13. `resolvePredictionEvent()`: (Resolver Role) Sets the final outcome (Yes/No) for a resolved event.
14. `triggerFluctuationSwap()`: (Anyone) Calculates the final token distribution for a resolved event based on predictions, outcome, and randomness. This function processes the pool and makes user balances claimable.
15. `claimAssetsPostSwap()`: User claims their final calculated share of Token A and Token B from a processed pool.
16. `getPredictionEvent()`: (View) Retrieves details of a specific prediction event.
17. `isPredictionEventResolved()`: (View) Checks if a prediction event has been resolved.
18. `getPredictionOutcome()`: (View) Gets the resolved outcome for an event (returns Unresolved if not resolved).
19. `getUserPosition()`: (View) Retrieves a user's committed stake and prediction for a specific event.
20. `getPoolState()`: (View) Gets the total committed assets and participant count for a pool before swaps are triggered.
21. `getPotentialSwapRatio()`: (View) Provides a *hypothetical* range of swap ratios based on outcome and potential random factors (illustrative, not exact).
22. `getParticipatingEvents()`: (View) Lists all event IDs a user is participating in.
23. `getTotalParticipants()`: (View) Gets the total number of unique participants in a pool.
24. `getPoolTotalAssets()`: (View) Gets the total amounts of Token A and B currently held by the contract for a specific pool *after* swaps are triggered but before claims.

        // Map randomFactor (0-999) to the ranges
        uint256 correctRange = 2200 - 1800; // 400
        correctPredictionWeightMultiplier = 1800 + (randomFactor * correctRange / 999);

        uint256 incorrectRange = 600 - 400; // 200
        incorrectPredictionWeightMultiplier = 400 + (randomFactor * incorrectRange / 999);


        // The distribution depends on who predicted Correct vs. Incorrect.
        // Total weight comes from summing up (user_stake * multiplier) for all users.
        // User's final share = (user_stake * multiplier) / total_effective_weight * total_pool_assets.
        // THIS REQUIRES ITERATING USERS OR A PULL-BASED CLAIM.

        // --- REVISED PLAN FOR GAS EFFICIENCY & COMPLEXITY ---
        // `triggerFluctuationSwap` will calculate the total "winning side" and "losing side" weight,
        // total effective weight, and calculate the *final claimable amount* for *each* participant
        // and store it in `userFinalBalanceA`/`B`. This pre-calculation is done once.
        // `claimAssetsPostSwap` will then just transfer the pre-calculated amount.
        // This still requires knowing who all the participants are. Let's add an array for this.

        // --- Adding User List Tracking (Requires careful gas consideration) ---
        // mapping(uint256 => address[]) public eventParticipants; // This mapping is needed but adds complexity/gas

        // For *this example*, we'll use a placeholder list of participants.
        // In a real contract, managing this list securely and efficiently is key.
        address[] memory participants = new address[](0); // Placeholder

        // In a real scenario, you'd populate 'participants' from storage:
        // participants = eventParticipants[_eventId]; // If you tracked them in an array

        // --- SIMULATION OF USER ITERATION (CONCEPTUAL LOOP) ---

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Complexity:**

1.  **State Machine:** The contract manages distinct states for each `PredictionEvent`: `Unresolved` -> `Resolved` -> `SwapsTriggered` -> `Claimable`. There's also a `Cancelled` state. Transitions are controlled by conditions (resolution block, resolver role, `swapsTriggered` flag).
2.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Uses `Ownable` for administrative functions and introduces a `ResolverRole` with dedicated functions to grant/revoke.
3.  **Probabilistic Outcome Swap:** The core mechanic isn't a simple 1:1 or fixed ratio swap. The outcome for each participant is modulated by:
    *   Whether their prediction was correct or incorrect.
    *   A pseudo-random factor determined at the time `triggerFluctuationSwap` is called.
    *   Their initial stake relative to the *total* effective stake of all participants in the pool.
4.  **Dynamic Calculation:** The final amounts transferred to users are not fixed amounts they committed, but a dynamically calculated share of the *entire pool's* assets based on the probabilistic outcome.
5.  **Pull Pattern for Claims:** To manage gas costs, especially with a potentially large number of participants, the swap logic calculates the necessary parameters (`totalPoolEffectiveWeight`, `eventRandomFactors`) *once* in `triggerFluctuationSwap`. Individual users then call `claimAssetsPostSwap` to perform their specific calculation and transfer. This distributes the computation cost.
6.  **Internal Accounting:** The contract tracks user positions, total committed assets, and total claimable assets internally before tokens are transferred out.
7.  **Gas Considerations (Acknowledged Limitations):**
    *   Iterating through all `eventParticipants` in `triggerFluctuationSwap` is gas-intensive for very large pools. Scalable solutions would involve batch processing or more complex data structures (e.g., linked lists) or relying entirely on off-chain calculation with on-chain verification/proofs (ZK?).
    *   Iterating through all event IDs in view functions like `getParticipatingEvents` or `getTotalLockedA/B` is also inefficient. Production dApps usually track these in more easily queryable ways (e.g., arrays per user/token).
    *   Growing the `eventParticipants` array in `enterFluctuationPool` costs gas.
8.  **Pseudo-Randomness (Security Warning):** The reliance on `blockhash` for randomness is explicitly insecure for financial applications. A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) service is necessary for production. The code includes comments highlighting this critical limitation.
9.  **Structured Data:** Uses `structs` and `enums` to manage complex data related to events and positions.

This contract goes beyond basic token transfers or simple swaps by introducing prediction, randomness, and a dynamic, outcome-dependent asset redistribution mechanism, while also touching upon gas optimization patterns (pull vs. push) and state management. The complexity lies in the interconnected calculations in `triggerFluctuationSwap` and `claimAssetsPostSwap` and the necessary state variables to support this logic.
