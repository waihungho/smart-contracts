Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts beyond typical ERC20/ERC721/basic DAO structures. It focuses on a "Quantum Governance DAO" with complex state, reputation, roles, dynamic proposals, and built-in attestation/verification features.

This contract combines:
1.  **Reputation System:** Alongside token weighting for governance.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions beyond just an owner.
3.  **Dynamic Proposal Types:** Allowing for different on-chain actions based on proposal outcomes.
4.  **Attestation Registry:** For verifiable claims managed by the DAO.
5.  **Pausable State:** Role-controlled emergency pause.
6.  **Delegate Voting:** Standard delegation pattern.
7.  **Basic VRF Integration Concept:** Placeholder for requesting verifiable randomness (actual implementation would require an oracle like Chainlink VRF).
8.  **Staking/Bonding:** For increased governance weight or membership requirements.

 *   - `isMember(address account)`: Checks if an address is a DAO member.
 *   - `getTotalMembers()`: Returns the total number of DAO members.
 *   - `transferToken(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers governance tokens (requires permission).
 *   - `balanceOfToken(address account)`: Gets token balance.
 *   - `stakeToken(uint256 amount)`: Stakes tokens for potential benefits (e.g., voting weight, membership tier).

 *   - `createTreasuryAllocationProposal(string memory description, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Creates a proposal to send funds from the treasury.
 *   - `createAttestationProposal(string memory description, address subject, bytes32 dataHash, uint64 expirationTimestamp)`: Creates a proposal to issue an attestation.
 *   - `createCustomProposal(string memory description, address target, bytes memory callData)`: Creates a generic proposal for arbitrary contract interaction (requires review/permissions).
 *   - `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Casts a weighted vote (token + reputation).
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal.
 *   - `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancels a proposal (only creator within time or specific role).
 *   - `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a proposal.
 *   - `getProposalVote(uint256 proposalId, address account)`: Gets vote details for a specific account on a proposal.
 *   - `getProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of proposals.
 * - DELEGATION:
 *   - `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Delegates voting power (token + reputation) to another member.
 *   - `getDelegatedVotee(address delegator)`: Gets who an address has delegated to.
 * - TREASURY:
 *   - `depositToTreasury()`: Allows sending funds to the DAO treasury.
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Gets the balance of the DAO contract.
 * - ATTESTATIONS:
 *   - `createAttestation(address subject, bytes32 dataHash, uint64 expirationTimestamp)`: Issues an attestation (via proposal execution).
 *   - `revokeAttestation(uint256 attestationId)`: Revokes an attestation (via proposal or authorized role).
 *   - `getAttestationDetails(uint256 attestationId)`: Gets attestation details.
 *   - `getAttestationsForSubject(address subject)`: Gets list of attestation IDs for a subject.
 * - VRF:
 *   - `requestRandomMemberSelection(bytes32 seed)`: Requests a random member selection (conceptual, needs oracle).
 * - QUERY:
 *   - `getMemberInfo(address account)`: Gets combined info (tokens, reputation, roles, stake).
 *   - `getRoleMembers(Role role)`: Returns list of addresses with a specific role (duplicate, but requested structure).
 *
 * Total Functions: 33
 *
 * Note: This contract is a complex example and would require extensive testing, gas optimization,
 *       and potential external library/oracle integration (like Chainlink VRF, access control libraries)
 *       for a production environment. The VRF part is conceptual here.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Reputation System:** Standard DAOs often only use token weight. This contract introduces `reputation` points (`uint256 members[account].reputation`) that are earned, lost, and crucially, factored into voting weight (`_getVotingWeight`). This allows the DAO to value participation and positive contributions beyond just capital stake.
2.  **Combined Token & Reputation Voting:** The `_getVotingWeight` function explicitly combines staked tokens and reputation (weighted by `REPUTATION_TOKEN_WEIGHT_RATIO`) to determine a member's influence in voting. This is a more nuanced governance model.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Instead of a single `owner` or simple whitelist, the contract uses an `enum Role` and a mapping `_roles` to define specific permissions (`onlyRole` modifier). This allows for distribution of responsibilities (Admin, Treasury, Emergency, Attestor) within the DAO itself.
4.  **Dynamic Proposal Execution:** The `ProposalType` enum and the `executeProposal` function handle different proposal outcomes dynamically. It uses low-level calls (`address(this).call`, `payable(target).call`) based on the proposal type (`PARAMETER_CHANGE`, `TREASURY_ALLOCATION`, `CUSTOM_CALL`, `ATTESTATION_ISSUE`), allowing the DAO to trigger arbitrary on-chain actions on itself or other contracts *if* passed by governance.
5.  **Attestation Registry:** The `Attestation` struct and `attestations` mapping provide a minimal, built-in registry. The DAO can issue verifiable claims (`createAttestation`) via proposals, and these claims can be queried (`getAttestationDetails`, `getAttestationsForSubject`) or revoked (`revokeAttestation`). This creates a layer of on-chain verifiable information governed by the DAO's consensus.
6.  **Pausable State with RBAC:** The `_paused` state variable and `whenNotPaused`/`whenPaused` modifiers implement a pause mechanism. However, unlike simple implementations, pausing/unpausing is restricted to a specific `EMERGENCY` role, adding a layer of decentralized control over the kill switch.
7.  **Staking/Bonding:** The `stakedTokens` in the `MemberInfo` struct and the `stakeToken`/`unstakeToken` functions introduce a bonding mechanism. Requiring a minimum stake to join (`MIN_JOIN_STAKE`) or propose (`MIN_PROPOSAL_STAKE`) aligns incentives and adds a cost to participation, potentially reducing spam. Staked tokens also contribute to voting weight.
8.  **Delegate Voting with Tracking:** The `delegateVote` function implements standard voting delegation. The `MemberInfo` struct includes `delegatedTo` and `delegatedBy` (simplified reverse mapping) to track delegation status. Voting weight is calculated using the *effective* voter (the delegatee) in `_getVotingWeight`.
9.  **Conceptual VRF Integration:** The `requestRandomMemberSelection` function shows *how* you might integrate a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) like Chainlink VRF into the DAO. While the placeholder implementation is not truly random, it demonstrates the intent to use on-chain verifiable randomness for tasks like selecting members for audits, committees, or tasks in a provably fair way. A real version would require Chainlink VRF contract interaction and a `fulfillRandomWords` callback.
10. **Complex State Relationships:** The contract manages interconnected state: members, their tokens, their staked tokens, their reputation, their roles, their delegation status, and the proposals they interact with. Queries like `getMemberInfo` demonstrate retrieving this consolidated data.
11. **Multiple Proposal Types:** The contract defines and handles multiple distinct proposal types (`PARAMETER_CHANGE`, `TREASURY_ALLOCATION`, `ATTESTATION_ISSUE`, `CUSTOM_CALL`), each triggering different logic upon successful execution. This makes the DAO capable of governing diverse actions.
12. **Treasury Management:** The `receive` and `depositToTreasury` functions allow the contract to receive native currency, establishing a DAO-controlled treasury. `createTreasuryAllocationProposal` shows how funds can be spent via governance.
13. **Basic Quorum/Threshold Logic:** `executeProposal` includes checks (`metQuorum`, `votesFor > votesAgainst`) based on the calculated voting weight, although the quorum check against total weight is marked as an area for optimization.
14. **Proposal Lifecycle:** Proposals move through distinct states (`PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `QUEUED`, `EXECUTED`, `CANCELLED`, `DEFEATED`, `EXPIRED`), enforced by modifiers and state checks before actions like voting or execution.
15. **Cancellation Mechanism:** `cancelProposal` provides a way to abort proposals under specific conditions (proposer grace period or Admin override), adding flexibility to the governance process.

This contract is designed to be a complex, interconnected system showcasing various advanced concepts working together within a single DAO structure, aiming to be distinct from standard open-source templates. Remember that a production version would require significantly more robust error handling, gas optimization, security checks (like reentrancy guards where calls are made), and potentially external library integration.
