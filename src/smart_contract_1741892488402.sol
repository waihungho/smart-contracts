 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - "ArtVerse DAO"
 * @author Bard (Example - Replace with your name/alias)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery managed by a DAO, featuring advanced concepts like:
 *      - Dynamic NFT metadata updates based on gallery events.
 *      - AI-powered art recommendation system (simulated on-chain).
 *      - Fractionalized NFT ownership and governance.
 *      - Time-based art exhibitions with rotating collections.
 *      - Artist revenue sharing and community rewards.
 *      - Decentralized curation and voting mechanisms.
 *      - On-chain reputation system for artists and curators.
 *      - Integration with external oracles for real-world data (simulated).
 *      - Gamified art discovery and engagement features.
 *      - Conditional access control based on user reputation or NFT ownership.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * 1. initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _daoTreasury): Initializes the gallery with a name and DAO treasury address.
 * 2. setGalleryCurator(address _curatorAddress): Sets the gallery curator (DAO-controlled, initially deployer).
 * 3. registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistBio): Allows artists to register with the gallery.
 * 4. createArtworkNFT(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash, uint256 _editionSize): Artists mint new artwork NFTs.
 * 5. setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price): Artists set the price for their artworks.
 * 6. purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Users purchase artworks, supporting fractional ownership (if enabled).
 * 7. listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId): Artists list their owned artworks for sale.
 * 8. unlistArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId): Artists unlist their artworks from sale.
 * 9. transferArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address _recipient): Allows artwork owners to transfer their NFTs.
 * 10. startExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime): Curator starts a new art exhibition.
 * 11. proposeArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId): Curator proposes artworks to be included in an exhibition.
 * 12. voteOnExhibitionArtwork(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId, bool _vote): Registered users vote on proposed artworks for exhibitions.
 * 13. finalizeExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Curator finalizes an exhibition after voting.
 * 14. getRecommendedArtworks(address _userAddress): (Simulated AI) Returns a list of recommended artworks for a user based on their history.
 * 15. fractionalizeArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions): Allows artwork owners to fractionalize their NFT.
 * 16. proposeGalleryGovernanceChange(string _proposalDescription, bytes _calldata): Allows users to propose changes to gallery parameters (DAO governance).
 * 17. voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Registered users vote on governance proposals.
 * 18. executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes a passed governance proposal (DAO controlled).
 * 19. stakeGalleryToken(uint256 _amount): Users can stake gallery tokens for reputation and rewards (simulated).
 * 20. claimStakingRewards(): Users claim accumulated staking rewards (simulated).
 * 21. updateArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string _newMetadataURI): Updates the metadata URI of an artwork NFT (demonstrates dynamic NFTs).
 * 22. redeemFractionalOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount): Redeem fractional tokens for a combined artwork NFT (if fractionalization enabled).
