Here's a smart contract in Solidity called "AuraVerse," designed to be interesting, advanced, creative, and trendy. It focuses on decentralized AI-generated art, dynamic NFTs, a reputation system, and DAO governance. To meet the requirement of a single smart contract file with many functions, it internally simulates ERC-721 and ERC-20 functionalities for the Aura NFTs and AuraPoints reputation token, respectively.

**Outline and Function Summary: AuraVerse - Dynamic AI Art & Decentralized Curation Protocol**

**I. Contract Overview**
AuraVerse is an advanced smart contract protocol enabling the creation, evolution, and decentralized curation of AI-generated art (Aura NFTs). It integrates an off-chain AI oracle, a robust on-chain reputation system (AuraPoints), dynamic NFT evolution mechanics, and DAO-based governance, fostering a vibrant, self-moderating digital art ecosystem.

**II. Core Components**
*   **Aura NFTs (ERC721-like):** Unique digital art pieces, dynamically evolving. Each Aura represents an AI-generated artwork with associated metadata (prompt, quality score, IPFS URI).
*   **AuraPoints (ERC20-like):** A reputation token earned through positive contributions (e.g., successful curation, governance participation) and used for governance voting, accessing premium features like Aura evolution, and flagging.
*   **AI Oracle Integration:** An external, off-chain service responsible for generating art based on user prompts and delivering the art's metadata (IPFS hash, AI-generated quality score) back to the contract.
*   **Decentralized Curation:** A community-driven mechanism where users can flag low-quality or inappropriate Aura NFTs, and other community members vote to validate or dispute these flags, affecting their AuraPoints balance.
*   **DAO Governance:** AuraPoints holders have the power to collectively propose and vote on changes to key protocol parameters, update the trusted oracle address, and manage future treasury funds.

**III. Function Summary (Total: 25 Functions)**

**A. Initialization & Administrative (Owner/DAO Controlled)**
1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, setting the deployer as the initial administrative owner.
2.  `setAIOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Updates the address of the trusted AI Oracle contract. Crucial for secure communication with the off-chain AI. Callable only by the DAO.
3.  `updateMintingParameters(uint256 _newBasePrice, uint256 _newMinPromptLength)`: Adjusts the base fee (in ETH/WEI) required for minting new Auras and the minimum character length for user prompts. Callable only by the DAO.
4.  `updateEvolutionParameters(uint256 _upvoteThreshold, uint256 _auraPointsCost)`: Sets the criteria for an Aura NFT to be eligible for evolution: a minimum number of community upvotes and the AuraPoints cost for the owner to trigger it. Callable only by the DAO.
5.  `toggleMintingPaused(bool _paused)`: Allows the DAO to pause or unpause new Aura NFT minting in emergencies or for upgrades.
6.  `withdrawProtocolFees(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Enables the DAO to withdraw accumulated protocol fees (from minting) to a specified address, typically for treasury management.

**B. Aura (NFT) Management**
7.  `requestAuraMint(string calldata _prompt)`: A user calls this to initiate the creation of a new Aura NFT. They pay the `baseMintingPrice` and provide a text prompt for the AI. This emits an event the AI Oracle monitors.
8.  `fulfillAuraMint(uint256 _requestId, address _minter, string calldata _tokenURI, uint256 _aiQualityScore)`: This is the callback function, callable *only by the trusted AI Oracle*, to finalize the Aura NFT creation. It takes the AI-generated art's IPFS URI and an AI-assigned quality score, then mints the NFT to the original minter.
9.  `triggerAuraEvolution(uint256 _auraId)`: Allows an Aura NFT owner to attempt to evolve their art. This requires sufficient AuraPoints and that the Aura meets `evolutionUpvoteThreshold` community upvotes. It signals the Oracle for potential re-generation or enhancement.
10. `burnAura(uint256 _auraId)`: Enables an Aura NFT owner to permanently remove (burn) their NFT from circulation. This action can have minor reputation implications.

**C. AuraPoints (Reputation) System**
11. `getAuraPoints(address _user)`: A read-only function to query the current AuraPoints balance of any user.
12. `rewardAuraPoints(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: An internal helper function used by the contract to grant AuraPoints to users for positive contributions (e.g., successful flagging, governance participation).
13. `penalizeAuraPoints(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: An internal helper function used by the contract to deduct AuraPoints from users for negative or disputed actions (e.g., failed flags, malicious behavior).
14. `claimAuraPoints()`: (Conceptual) A placeholder function indicating how users might claim various accrued AuraPoints rewards. In a full system, rewards would accumulate and be claimable.

**D. Decentralized Curation & Moderation**
15. `flagAuraForReview(uint256 _auraId, string calldata _reason)`: Allows users to flag an Aura NFT they believe is low quality or inappropriate. This action costs a small amount of AuraPoints to prevent spam.
16. `voteOnFlaggedAura(uint256 _flagId, bool _isAppropriate)`: Community members use this to vote on active flagged Auras. They incur a small AuraPoints cost and their vote contributes to the resolution.
17. `resolveFlaggedAura(uint256 _flagId)`: Resolves a flagged Aura review based on the collected community votes. It distributes rewards or penalties to the flagger, voters, and the Aura owner based on the outcome.
18. `reportOracleMisconduct(uint256 _requestId, string calldata _reason)`: Users can report instances where the AI Oracle failed to deliver or provided incorrect data for a `requestAuraMint`. This helps maintain the Oracle's reputation (off-chain) and rewards vigilant users.

**E. DAO Governance**
19. `proposeParameterChange(string calldata _description, address _target, bytes calldata _callData)`: Users with sufficient AuraPoints can submit proposals to change contract parameters or call arbitrary functions within the protocol. This forms the basis of decentralized governance.
20. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: AuraPoints holders cast their vote (for or against) on an active governance proposal. Their voting power is proportional to their AuraPoints balance.
21. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Any user can call this function once a proposal's voting period has ended and it has met the required quorum and majority. If successful, the proposed changes are enacted.
22. `delegateAuraPoints(address _delegatee)`: Allows users to delegate their AuraPoints voting power to another address. This enables passive participation in governance for users who don't want to vote directly.

**F. Read-Only / Query Functions**
23. `getAuraDetails(uint256 _auraId)`: Provides comprehensive details about a specific Aura NFT, including its owner, URI, prompt, quality score, and flag status.
24. `getFlaggedAuraStatus(uint256 _flagId)`: Returns the current state of a flagged Aura review, including vote counts for removal and against removal.
25. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves all relevant information about a governance proposal, such as its description, target function, voting status, and execution status.
