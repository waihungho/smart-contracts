/**
 * @title Verifiable AI Prediction Market
 * @author [Your Name/Organization]
 * @notice This contract implements a prediction market where participants bet on the outcome of an AI prediction.
 *         The AI prediction itself is provably generated off-chain and verifiable on-chain using a zero-knowledge proof.
 * @dev This contract leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for AI outcome verification.
 *      It requires a compatible off-chain system to generate the AI prediction and corresponding ZKP.
 *
 * Outline:
 *  1. Market Setup: Defines the prediction target (e.g., stock price, weather condition) and parameters.
 *  2. Betting Phase:  Allows users to bet on "YES" or "NO" for the AI's prediction.  Uses a simple bonding curve for price discovery.
 *  3. AI Prediction Submission:  An authorized oracle (or the contract owner after a delay) submits the AI prediction and its associated ZKP.
 *  4. ZKP Verification:  The contract verifies the ZKP against the submitted AI prediction, ensuring integrity.
 *  5. Outcome Determination:  If the ZKP is valid, the contract determines the outcome based on the AI prediction.
 *  6. Payout:  Distributes funds to winning bettors based on their initial stake and the overall betting pool ratio.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - constructor(address _verifierAddress, string memory _predictionTarget, uint256 _marketDuration, uint256 _verificationGracePeriod): Initializes the market.
 *  - betYes(uint256 _amount):  Allows a user to bet on "YES".  Calculates and returns tokens representing their stake.
 *  - betNo(uint256 _amount):   Allows a user to bet on "NO". Calculates and returns tokens representing their stake.
 *  - submitPrediction(uint256 _prediction, bytes memory _proof): Submits the AI prediction and its ZKP.  Only callable by an authorized oracle.
 *  - verifyProof(uint256 _prediction, bytes memory _proof):  Internal function to verify the ZKP.  Uses a pre-deployed Verifier contract.
 *  - resolveMarket(): Resolves the market and distributes rewards.  Callable after the verification grace period.
 *  - withdrawRewards(): Allows winners to withdraw their earnings.
 *  - redeemTokens():  Allows users to redeem their "YES" or "NO" tokens for their underlying stake (before resolution).
 *  - setOracle(address _newOracle):  Allows the owner to update the authorized oracle address.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:** Provides a roadmap of the contract's functionality. This is crucial for understanding the high-level design.
* **ZK Proof Verification:**  The core idea of using zero-knowledge proofs to verify the integrity of the AI prediction is implemented.  The `submitPrediction` function receives the AI's prediction and the ZKP.  The `verifyProof` function calls an external `IVerifier` contract (that you would need to deploy separately) to perform the actual ZKP verification.  The proof is decoded from bytes into the required format for the verifier.
* **Oracle Role:** An `oracle` address is used to submit the AI's prediction.  The `onlyOracle` modifier restricts access to the `submitPrediction` function.  The contract owner can update the oracle.
* **Betting Pools and Tokenization:**  Separate pools for "YES" and "NO" bets are maintained (`yesPool`, `noPool`).  ERC20 tokens (`yesToken`, `noToken`) are minted and distributed to bettors, representing their stake in the respective pools.  This allows for more complex trading and analysis of bets.
* **`ReentrancyGuard`:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks, a common vulnerability in smart contracts.
* **`Ownable`:** Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` to provide ownership management (e.g., changing the oracle).
* **Clear Error Messages:**  Uses `require` statements with informative error messages to help with debugging.
* **Events:** Emits events for key actions like betting, prediction submission, proof verification, and market resolution, making it easier to track the contract's state and activity.
* **Fallback Function:** Includes a `receive()` function so the contract can accept ETH transfers (necessary for the betting mechanism).
* **Token Redemption:**  Adds a `redeemTokens` function that allows users to burn their YES or NO tokens and receive a proportional amount of ETH back from the corresponding pool *before* the market is resolved.  This provides liquidity and allows users to exit their positions early.  Crucially, it adjusts the pool size and user stakes accordingly.
* **`IVerifier` Interface:**  Defines an interface for the ZKP verifier contract. This makes the contract more modular and allows you to use different ZKP verification implementations without modifying the core logic of the prediction market.  **Important:** You'll need to deploy a separate verifier contract (using something like Circom or ZoKrates) that implements the `IVerifier` interface.
* **Groth16 Assumption:**  The code assumes a Groth16 ZKP scheme and extracts the `a`, `b`, `c`, and `input` components from the `_proof` bytes. You'll need to adjust the decoding logic if you're using a different ZKP scheme.
* **Gas Optimizations:**  While the code is functional, further gas optimization can be done, such as using assembly for certain operations.  However, readability and clarity were prioritized here.
* **Security Considerations:** The contract has basic security measures, but it's critical to have it audited by security professionals before deploying to a production environment.  Specifically, the ZKP verification process is complex and requires careful attention.
* **Example AI Result:** The `resolveMarket` function contains a placeholder for determining the market outcome based on the `aiPrediction`. You'll need to replace this with the appropriate logic based on the specific prediction target.
* **Important Notes on ZKPs:**

    * **Off-Chain Computation:** The computationally intensive part of generating the AI prediction *and* the ZKP must be done off-chain. Solidity is not suitable for complex AI calculations.
    * **Verifier Contract:** You *must* deploy a separate ZKP verifier contract that implements the `IVerifier` interface.  This contract will contain the verification key for your ZKP circuit.  The verifier contract is generated along with your ZKP circuit using tools like Circom or ZoKrates.
    * **Proof Format:** The format of the `_proof` bytes needs to match the output format of your ZKP proving system.  The code currently assumes Groth16, but you can adapt it for other schemes.

This improved version provides a more complete and realistic foundation for building a verifiable AI prediction market.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it.  Also, the off-chain component (AI prediction and ZKP generation) is crucial and needs to be implemented separately.
