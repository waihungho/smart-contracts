Okay, let's design a smart contract that acts as a decentralized AI Oracle platform. This contract will allow users to request predictions or data classifications from registered AI providers, who stake tokens to participate and are rewarded or potentially penalized based on submitting timely and accurate results (aligned with consensus).

This concept combines several advanced themes:
1.  **Oracles:** Bringing off-chain data/computation on-chain.
2.  **Decentralization:** Relying on multiple providers for robustness and censorship resistance.
3.  **Staking:** Economic incentives and disincentives for providers.
4.  **AI Integration (Indirect):** Facilitating the *use* of off-chain AI models within a blockchain context.
5.  **Consensus Mechanism:** Determining the "correct" result from multiple submissions.
6.  **Flexible Data:** Handling arbitrary inputs and outputs (`bytes`) guided by metadata.

It's important to note that the AI model itself runs *off-chain*. The smart contract manages the *request*, the *submission* of results by providers, and the *aggregation/consensus* of those results on-chain.

**Smart Contract: DecentralizedAIPredictionOracle**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:**
    *   Owner address
    *   Token address used for staking and fees
    *   Counters for unique IDs (requests, model types)
    *   Mappings for Requests, Providers, Model Types
    *   Configuration parameters (fee rates, minimum stake, quorum size, submission window, consensus method, consensus threshold)
    *   Protocol fee balance

2.  **Enums:**
    *   RequestStatus (Requested, ResultsSubmitted, ConsensusReached, Failed, Cancelled)

3.  **Structs:**
    *   `Request`: Stores request details (user, model type, input data, status, timestamp, submitted results)
    *   `Provider`: Stores provider details (address, total stake, active state, reputation/score)
    *   `ModelType`: Stores AI model type details (description, input hint, output hint, active state, min stake, quorum, consensus threshold)
    *   `ProviderResult`: Stores individual provider submissions (provider address, raw result bytes, submission timestamp)

4.  **Events:**
    *   `PredictionRequested`
    *   `PredictionResultSubmitted`
    *   `ConsensusReached`
    *   `ProviderStaked`
    *   `ProviderUnstaked`
    *   `AIModelTypeRegistered`
    *   `ConfigUpdated`
    *   `FeesWithdrawn`
    *   `ProviderPaused`
    *   `ProviderResumed`

5.  **Functions:**

        *   `unpauseProvider`
        *   `withdrawProtocolFees`
        *   `transferOwnership`
    *   **Provider Actions:**
        *   `stakeForProvider`
        *   `unstakeFromProvider`
        *   `submitPredictionResult`
    *   **User Actions:**
        *   `requestPrediction`
        *   `processRequestResults` (Can be called by anyone after window/quorum)
        *   `getPredictionResult`
        *   `getPredictionStatus`
        *   `getProviderStake`

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address _stakingToken)`: Sets the staking token address and initializes the owner.
2.  `registerAIModelType(string memory description, bytes memory inputTypeHint, bytes memory outputTypeHint, uint256 minStake, uint256 quorumSize, uint256 consensusThreshold)`: Allows the owner to add a new type of AI model that providers can support and users can request predictions for. Defines expected data formats, staking requirements, and consensus parameters for this model type.
3.  `updateAIModelType(uint256 modelTypeId, string memory description, bytes memory inputTypeHint, bytes memory outputTypeHint, uint256 minStake, uint256 quorumSize, uint256 consensusThreshold)`: Allows the owner to modify parameters of an existing model type.
4.  `deactivateAIModelType(uint256 modelTypeId)`: Allows the owner to deactivate a model type, preventing new requests for it.
5.  `setFeeRate(uint256 rate)`: Allows the owner to set the fee percentage charged to users per request (fee is percentage of staking token).
6.  `setMinStake(uint256 modelTypeId, uint256 amount)`: Allows the owner to set the minimum staking requirement for providers for a specific model type. *Note: Redundant with `registerAIModelType` param, but kept for update flexibility.*
7.  `setQuorumSize(uint256 modelTypeId, uint256 size)`: Allows the owner to set the minimum number of provider submissions required before consensus can be processed for a model type request.
8.  `setResultSubmissionWindow(uint256 duration)`: Allows the owner to set the time duration within which providers must submit results after a request is made.
9.  `setConsensusThreshold(uint256 modelTypeId, uint256 percentage)`: Allows the owner to set the percentage of submitted results that must agree for consensus to be reached for a specific model type.
10. `pauseProvider(address provider)`: Allows the owner to temporarily disable a provider from submitting results or participating in new requests.
11. `unpauseProvider(address provider)`: Allows the owner to re-enable a paused provider.
12. `withdrawProtocolFees(address recipient)`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated protocol fees to a specified address.
13. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of the contract.
14. `stakeForProvider(uint256 amount, uint256 modelTypeId)`: Allows a provider to stake the required token for a specific model type, registering them as a potential provider for that type. Requires token approval beforehand.
15. `unstakeFromProvider(uint256 amount, uint256 modelTypeId)`: Allows a provider to withdraw their staked tokens. May be subject to limitations if they have active pending requests or potential penalties.
16. `requestPrediction(uint256 modelTypeId, string memory inputData, uint256 feeAmount)`: Allows a user to request a prediction for a specific AI model type, providing the input data. Requires approval of the `feeAmount` (in staking tokens) beforehand. The contract pulls eligible providers for this type.
17. `submitPredictionResult(uint256 requestId, bytes memory rawResult)`: Allows a registered and staked AI provider to submit their calculated result for a specific request ID within the submission window.
18. `processRequestResults(uint256 requestId)`: Can be called by anyone after the submission window has passed or the quorum of results has been reached. This function calculates consensus based on submitted results, distributes fees to providers who submitted matching/majority results, and potentially flags providers who submitted deviating results (basic implementation here simply distributes fees to consensus providers). Transitions request status to `ConsensusReached` or `Failed`.
19. `getPredictionResult(uint256 requestId)`: Allows the user (or anyone) to retrieve the final, consolidated result once consensus has been reached.
20. `getPredictionStatus(uint256 requestId)`: Returns the current status of a request.
21. `getProviderStake(address provider, uint256 modelTypeId)`: Returns the amount of tokens staked by a provider for a specific model type.
22. `getProviderInfo(address provider)`: Returns the overall status and stake information for a provider.
23. `getModelTypeInfo(uint256 modelTypeId)`: Returns details about a specific registered AI model type.
24. `getRequestDetails(uint256 requestId)`: Returns comprehensive details about a specific request, including submitted results.
25. `getProtocolFeeBalance()`: Returns the total amount of accumulated protocol fees held by the contract.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Decentralized AI Oracle:** It's not a single entity providing data but a network of staked providers. This increases resilience and censorship resistance compared to a centralized oracle.
2.  **Staking Mechanism:** Providers lock value (`stakingToken`) to participate. This provides an economic incentive to behave honestly (earn fees) and a disincentive for misbehavior (potential future slashing, though basic slashing isn't fully implemented here).
3.  **Flexible Model Types (`ModelType` struct and Hints):** The contract isn't hardcoded for one type of data (like price feeds). It can support various "AI models" (sentiment analysis, image classification hashes, complex predictions) defined by metadata (`inputTypeHint`, `outputTypeHint`). This makes the oracle adaptable to different AI tasks.
4.  **On-Chain Consensus:** The `processRequestResults` function implements a consensus algorithm (simplified majority vote on `bytes`) to agree on a single result from multiple provider submissions. This is crucial for trust in decentralized data. The threshold and quorum are configurable per model type.
5.  **Economic Incentives:** Users pay fees (in `stakingToken`), which are distributed to providers who successfully contribute to a consensus result, minus a protocol fee. This aligns incentives between users and providers.
6.  **State Machine for Requests:** Requests progress through defined states (`Requested`, `ResultsSubmitted`, `ConsensusReached`, `Failed`), managing the workflow and ensuring functions are called at appropriate times.
7.  **Bytes for Data Flexibility:** Using `bytes` for inputs and outputs allows the oracle to handle virtually any type of data structure, as long as off-chain providers and users agree on the encoding format (guided by the hints).
8.  **Separation of Concerns:** The contract manages the *protocol* (requests, stakes, consensus, fees) but delegates the *computation* (running the AI model) to off-chain participants. This is essential as running complex AI on-chain is prohibitively expensive and slow.
9.  **Configurability:** Key parameters like fee rate, minimum stake, quorum size, and consensus threshold are owner-configurable, allowing the network to adapt over time.
10. **Owner/DAO Pattern:** Uses Ownable for basic access control, acknowledging that a real-world decentralized system might evolve to DAO governance for these configuration parameters.

This contract provides a robust framework for a decentralized AI oracle network, showcasing how smart contracts can interact with and incentivize off-chain computational resources while maintaining trust and transparency through on-chain verification and consensus.
