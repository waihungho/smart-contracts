 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, showcasing advanced concepts
 *      such as on-chain curation, dynamic pricing, community-driven exhibitions, and artist support mechanisms.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Gallery Management:**
 *    - `setGalleryName(string _name)`: Allows the contract owner to set the gallery's name.
 *    - `setStakeToken(address _tokenAddress)`: Allows the contract owner to set the token used for staking and governance.
 *    - `setStakeAmount(uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner to set the minimum stake amount to become a stakeholder.
 *    - `emergencyWithdraw(address _tokenAddress, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Emergency function for owner to withdraw stuck tokens in case of unforeseen issues.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(address _nftContract, uint256 _tokenId, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to submit their NFTs for consideration.
 *    - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Stakeholders can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork including submission status, votes, etc.
 *    - `getGalleryArtworks()`: Returns a list of IDs of artworks currently accepted into the gallery.
 *    - `rejectArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Governance/Admin) Forcefully rejects an artwork after submission.
 *    - `removeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Governance/Admin) Removes an artwork from the gallery (e.g., due to policy violation).
 *
 * **3. Exhibition & Dynamic Display:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows stakeholders to propose and create exhibitions.
 *    - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: (Curator/Exhibition Creator) Adds approved artworks to a specific exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: (Curator/Exhibition Creator) Removes artworks from an exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition, including artworks.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Returns a list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **4. Stakeholder Governance & Community Features:**
 *    - `stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake tokens to become stakeholders and participate in governance.
 *    - `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows stakeholders to unstake their tokens.
 *    - `getStakeholderBalance(address _stakeholder)`: Retrieves the staked balance of a stakeholder.
 *    - `proposeGalleryUpdate(string memory _proposalDescription, bytes memory _calldata)`: Allows stakeholders to propose changes to gallery parameters via governance.
 *    - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Stakeholders can vote on active governance proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Governance/Admin) Executes a proposal after it reaches quorum and passes.
 *    - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific governance proposal.
 *
 * **5. Artist Support & Revenue Sharing (Conceptual):**
 *    - `donateToArtist(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to directly donate to artists whose work is in the gallery.
 *    - `distributeArtistDonations(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal/Automated) Distributes accumulated donations to the artist of a specific artwork.
 *
