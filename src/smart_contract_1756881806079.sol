This smart contract, `AdaptiveYieldVault`, embodies several advanced and trending concepts in decentralized finance. It functions as a dynamic yield optimization vault where users can deposit funds, which are then strategically allocated across various yield-generating strategies. The core innovation lies in its integration of **simulated ZK-proofs for private strategy contribution**, **AI-driven dynamic risk rebalancing**, and **flash loan integration for efficient capital management**.

While individual components like yield aggregators or flash loans exist, this contract aims for a unique combination: strategists can propose new, high-yield opportunities *privately* via ZK-proofs to prevent front-running. Once approved by governance (after conceptual ZK verification), these strategies are integrated into a vault that dynamically adjusts its asset allocation based on perceived risk factors and insights from a (simulated) AI oracle, all while leveraging flash loans for efficient rebalancing.

## Function Summary:
1.  **`deposit(uint256 amount, uint256 riskProfileId)`**: Users deposit base token into the vault, receiving shares proportional to their deposit and the vault's current value. Users also specify their preferred risk profile.
2.  **`withdraw(uint256 shares)`**: Users redeem their vault shares for base token, proportional to their stake in the vault's total value. Funds are withdrawn from strategies and idle capital.
3.  **`getTotalShares()`**: Returns the total number of shares minted by the vault, representing the collective stake of all users.
4.  **`getVaultValue()`**: Returns the total value of assets managed by the vault, including unallocated funds and assets held within all active strategies, denominated in the base token.
5.  **`getAvailableDepositCapacity()`**: Indicates how much more base token can be deposited into the vault. Currently returns `MAX_UINT256` as there's no hard cap.
6.  **`proposeStrategy(bytes32 zkProofHash)`**: Approved strategists submit a hash of their ZK-proof, conceptually proving the validity and adherence of a new yield strategy without revealing its specific smart contract details yet.
7.  **`verifyAndRevealStrategy(bytes memory proofData, address strategyAddress)`**: Governance verifies the submitted ZK-proof (simulated off-chain verification) and, if valid, reveals the actual strategy contract address, making it eligible for approval.
8.  **`approveStrategy(address strategyAddress)`**: Governance officially approves a revealed strategy. This makes the strategy 'active' and eligible to receive funds from the vault.
9.  **`deactivateStrategy(address strategyAddress)`**: Governance deactivates an active strategy, preventing further fund allocation to it and initiating a full withdrawal of its existing funds back to the vault.
10. **`allocateToStrategy(address strategyAddress, uint256 percentage)`**: Governance allocates a specific percentage (in permille, 0-1000) of the vault's available funds to a single active strategy.
11. **`rebalanceAllocation(address[] calldata strategies, uint256[] calldata percentages)`**: Governance initiates a comprehensive rebalancing. It reallocates funds across multiple specified strategies based on new percentage distributions (summing to 1000 permille).
12. **`defineRiskProfile(uint256 id, uint256 maxRiskScore, uint256 minDiversificationFactor)`**: Governance defines custom risk tolerance profiles, specifying parameters like maximum acceptable aggregate risk score and minimum strategy diversification for users.
13. **`updateStrategyRiskScore(address strategyAddress, uint256 newScore)`**: Governance or a trusted oracle updates the risk score associated with a particular strategy, influencing dynamic rebalancing decisions.
14. **`triggerDynamicRebalance()`**: Allows anyone to call this function, which triggers an internal, algorithm-driven rebalance of funds across active strategies based on current risk scores and potential AI insights.
15. **`getStrategyRiskScore(address strategyAddress)`**: Returns the current risk score assigned to a specific strategy.
16. **`setAIOracle(address newOracle)`**: Governance sets the address of the trusted AI Oracle, which provides market insights.
17. **`receiveAIInsights(bytes32 insightHash)`**: The AI Oracle pushes new market insights (represented by a hash) to the vault. This can trigger or inform subsequent rebalancing decisions.
18. **`processAIRebalanceSuggestion(address[] calldata strategies, uint256[] calldata percentages, bytes32 insightHash)`**: Governance or an authorized relayer can execute a rebalance suggested by the AI Oracle, linking it to a specific insight hash.
19. **`executeFlashLoanArbitrage(address tokenIn, uint256 amount, address tokenOut, uint256 minAmountOut, bytes calldata data)`**: Initiates a flash loan with a configured provider to perform arbitrage or highly efficient rebalancing operations within the vault.
20. **`onFlashLoan(address initiator, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 fee, bytes calldata data)`**: The callback function for `executeFlashLoanArbitrage`, where the actual logic for utilizing and repaying the flash loan is executed.
21. **`withdrawFees()`**: Governance or an authorized address can withdraw accumulated performance fees from the vault's idle funds.
22. **`updatePerformanceFee(uint256 newFee)`**: Governance updates the percentage (in basis points) of the performance fee charged on vault profits.
23. **`setGovernance(address newGovernance)`**: Transfers the contract's governance (ownership) role to a new address.
24. **`addApprovedStrategist(address strategist)`**: Whitelists an address, allowing it to propose new strategies to the vault.
25. **`removeApprovedStrategist(address strategist)`**: Removes an address from the approved strategist whitelist.
26. **`emergencyWithdrawAll()`**: A critical function allowing governance to immediately withdraw all funds from all strategies and the vault itself in case of an emergency or critical exploit.
