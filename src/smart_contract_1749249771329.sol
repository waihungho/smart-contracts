Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates interesting, advanced, and creative concepts beyond standard patterns like basic token vaults, simple vesting, or typical DeFi primitives. We'll call it the "Quantum Flux Vault" – a contract that holds assets and releases them based on a complex web of conditions, including probabilistic outcomes and inter-condition dependencies ("entanglement").

**Concept:**

The Quantum Flux Vault acts as a secure container for ETH, ERC-20, and ERC-721 tokens. Unlike a simple time-locked vault or multi-sig, asset release is governed by a set of dynamic, recipient-specific "flux conditions". These conditions can be time-based, event-triggered, require holding specific NFTs, or even depend on a probabilistic outcome derived from external randomness. The unique aspect is the ability to "entangle" conditions, meaning the state of one condition can influence the state of another for a specific recipient.

**Advanced/Creative Features:**

1.  **Multi-Conditional Release:** Assets for a recipient are only claimable when *all* assigned conditions are met.
2.  **Probabilistic Conditions:** Integrates a placeholder for verifiable randomness (like Chainlink VRF) to determine if a specific release condition is met upon request. The "flux quantum" refers to this moment of probabilistic determination.
3.  **Condition Entanglement:** Define dependencies between conditions (e.g., Condition A requires Condition B to be true, or Condition C and D are mutually exclusive – only one can be true for the claim).
4.  **Dynamic NFT Gating:** Require ownership of specific or *any* of a set of NFTs at the moment of claiming.
5.  **Event-Triggered Release:** Conditions can be tied to abstract events that are signaled to the contract (e.g., "ProjectMilestoneReached").
6.  **Vault States:** The contract can exist in different operational states (Setup, Active, Paused, ResolverActive) affecting available actions.
7.  **Resolver Role:** A designated address can resolve the state of certain conditions (e.g., confirming an external event occurred) or mediate disputes.
8.  **Conditional Parameter Updates:** Owner can dynamically adjust parameters of *existing* conditions within constraints.
9.  **Claim Limits/Weights:** Recipients can be assigned weights determining their potential share of the vault's contents upon meeting conditions.
10. **Atomic Claim:** A single transaction attempts to check *all* relevant conditions and claim eligible assets across different types.
