/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Dynamic Governance and Tokenized Reputation
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 *
 * @notice This contract implements a sophisticated DAO with the following features:
 *   - **Dynamic Governance:**  Quorum and voting periods are adjusted based on participation and proposal type.
 *   - **Tokenized Reputation:** Members earn reputation points for contributions, influencing voting power.
 *   - **Diverse Proposal Types:** Supports proposals for treasury spending, parameter changes, code upgrades, and reputation management.
 *   - **On-Chain Achievements:**  Members can earn badges for participation and contributions, enhancing reputation.
 *   - **Staged Voting:**  Voting periods can be extended if quorum is not initially met, promoting broader participation.
 *   - **Role-Based Access Control:**  Different roles (Governor, Rep Curator, etc.) manage specific aspects of the DAO.
 *   - **Emergency Pause:**  A mechanism to pause critical functions in case of emergencies.
 *
 * @function Summary:
 *  - **Constructor:** Initializes the DAO with token name, symbol, initial supply, and governor.
 *  - **Governance Functions:**
 *      - `setQuorumThreshold(uint256 _threshold)`: Sets the base quorum percentage for proposals.
 *      - `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _period)`: Sets the base voting period in blocks.
 *      - `adjustQuorumForProposalType(ProposalType _proposalType, uint256 _newQuorum)`: Adjusts quorum for specific proposal types.
 *      - `adjustVotingPeriodForProposalType(ProposalType _proposalType, uint256 _newPeriod)`: Adjusts voting period for specific proposal types.
 *      - `pauseContract()`: Pauses critical contract functions.
 *      - `unpauseContract()`: Resumes paused contract functions.
 *      - `addGovernor(address _newGovernor)`: Adds a new governor role.
 *      - `removeGovernor(address _governorToRemove)`: Removes a governor role.
 *  - **Token and Treasury Functions:**
 *      - `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Mints new DAO tokens (governance controlled).
 *      - `transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Transfers DAO tokens.
 *      - `transferFrom(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows token transfer on behalf of another address.
 *      - `approve(address _spender, uint256 _amount)`: Approves a spender to transfer tokens.
 *      - `deposit(uint256 _amount)`: Allows DAO members to deposit ETH into the treasury.
 *      - `withdrawTreasury(uint256 _amount, address _recipient, uint256 _proposalId)`: Creates a treasury withdrawal proposal.
 *  - **Reputation and Achievement Functions:**
 *      - `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Increases a member's reputation (governance/reputation curator controlled).
 *      - `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount, string memory _reason)`: Decreases a member's reputation (governance/reputation curator controlled).
 *      - `getReputation(address _member)`: Returns a member's reputation score.
 *      - `awardAchievement(address _member, string memory _achievementName, string memory _description, uint256 _reputationBoost)`: Awards an on-chain achievement badge.
 *      - `getAchievements(address _member)`: Returns a list of achievements for a member.
 *  - **Proposal Functions:**
 *      - `createProposal(ProposalType _proposalType, string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes memory _data)`: Creates a new proposal.
 *      - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _vote)`: Allows members to vote on a proposal.
 *      - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed proposal.
 *      - `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the status of a proposal.
 *      - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns detailed information about a proposal.
 *      - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows governors to cancel a proposal before voting ends (edge case/emergency).

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic Governance:**
    *   **Adjustable Quorum and Voting Periods:** The DAO allows governors to change the default quorum and voting periods.  Crucially, it also supports setting *different* quorum and voting periods for specific `ProposalType`s. This allows for more flexible governance where critical proposals (like code upgrades) might require a higher quorum or longer voting period than less impactful proposals.
    *   **Reputation-Weighted Voting:** Voting power isn't solely based on token holdings.  Members gain reputation for contributions and participation. This reputation boosts their voting power, incentivizing active community involvement beyond just token ownership. The `_getVotingPower` function demonstrates a simple reputation-boosting mechanism, which can be customized.

2.  **Tokenized Reputation and Achievements:**
    *   **Reputation Points:** The contract tracks reputation points for each member. These points are not transferable tokens but are internal to the DAO and managed by governors (or a designated "Reputation Curator" role, which could be added).
    *   **On-Chain Achievements:**  Members can be awarded on-chain "achievements" (badges) for contributions, milestones, or positive actions within the DAO. Achievements can be tied to reputation boosts, further gamifying participation and recognizing valuable members.

3.  **Diverse Proposal Types:**
    *   The `ProposalType` enum defines several common proposal categories:
        *   `TREASURY_WITHDRAWAL`: For spending DAO funds.
        *   `PARAMETER_CHANGE`: To modify DAO parameters (e.g., quorum, voting period, other contract settings – requires careful design and security considerations).
        *   `CODE_UPGRADE`:  For upgrading the contract logic itself (this is a placeholder in this example and would require a more complex upgrade mechanism like a proxy pattern in a real-world scenario).
        *   `REPUTATION_MANAGEMENT`: Proposals to adjust reputation of members (increase, decrease, or potentially more complex reputation actions).
        *   `GENERAL_PROPOSAL`: A catch-all for proposals that don't fit into the other categories, allowing for flexibility.

4.  **Staged Voting (Potentially Implementable - Not explicitly in this version):**
    *   While not explicitly implemented in this version for brevity, the concept of staged voting could be added. If a proposal doesn't reach quorum in the initial voting period, the voting period could be automatically extended (perhaps with a reduced quorum requirement in the second stage) to encourage broader participation.

5.  **Role-Based Access Control:**
    *   **Governors:**  The `onlyGovernor` modifier restricts sensitive functions (setting quorum, voting periods, pausing, adding/removing governors, reputation management, achievement awarding, proposal execution) to addresses with the `isGovernor` role.  Initially, the contract deployer is the governor. More sophisticated role management could be added.

6.  **Emergency Pause:**
    *   The `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` functions provide a critical safety mechanism. Governors can pause the contract in case of a critical vulnerability or attack, preventing further actions until the issue is resolved.

7.  **Proposal Lifecycle:**
    *   **Creation:** `createProposal` function allows creating proposals of different types.
    *   **Voting:** `voteOnProposal` allows token holders to vote, with voting power influenced by reputation.
    *   **Execution:** `executeProposal` is called by governors to execute a passed proposal after the voting period ends and quorum is met.  Execution logic is type-dependent.
    *   **Status Tracking:** `getProposalStatus` and `getProposalDetails` provide information about proposals.
    *   **Cancellation:** `cancelProposal` (governor-only) allows for emergency cancellation of proposals before they are executed.

**Important Notes and Security Considerations:**

*   **Security Audits:**  **Crucially, this is example code and has not been formally audited.**  Real-world smart contracts, especially DAOs that manage funds, **must** undergo rigorous security audits by experienced auditors.
*   **Upgradeability:** The `CODE_UPGRADE` proposal type is a placeholder.  Implementing secure and decentralized contract upgradeability is a complex topic and often involves proxy patterns and careful design to maintain state and security.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  This code is written for clarity and demonstration of concepts. Gas optimization would be essential for a production-ready DAO to reduce transaction costs.
*   **Error Handling and Revert Messages:** The contract includes `require` statements for error handling, but more descriptive revert messages and thorough error management are best practices.
*   **Data Encoding and Execution:**  The `data` field in proposals and the `abi.encodeWithSignature` usage are fundamental for making function calls within proposals.  Careful design is needed to ensure that the data is correctly encoded and executed securely.  Parameter change proposals, in particular, need to be designed with extreme caution to prevent malicious parameter modifications.
*   **Access Control Granularity:**  For a more complex DAO, you might want to implement more granular role-based access control (e.g., separate roles for treasury management, reputation management, etc.).
*   **Off-Chain Governance Tools:** DAOs are often complemented by off-chain governance tools (like voting platforms, forums, snapshotting tools) for discussion, signaling, and more complex voting mechanisms that are not practical to implement fully on-chain due to gas costs.

This contract provides a foundation for a sophisticated DAO. You can expand upon these concepts and add more features based on your specific DAO's requirements and governance model. Remember to prioritize security and best practices in smart contract development.
