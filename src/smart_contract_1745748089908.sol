Okay, let's create a smart contract with an interesting, advanced, and creative concept. We'll build a "Quantum Flux Auction" â€“ a multi-phase auction where the final settlement amount and refund structure are influenced by the dynamic "flux" level of the auction, which changes based on bidding activity and timing. This isn't a standard English, Dutch, or Sealed Bid auction.

It incorporates:
1.  **Multi-Phase System:** Different rules/dynamics apply in different phases.
2.  **Dynamic State ('Flux'):** A value (`currentFlux`) changes based on bidding behavior, influencing the outcome.
3.  **Entropy Accumulation:** A pseudo-randomness or activity metric (`accumulatedEntropy`) derived from bid timing and values, influencing the flux and phase transitions.
4.  **Flux-Influenced Settlement:** The winning bidder pays the highest bid, but losing bidders receive a refund amount that is *less* than their bid, with the deducted amount depending on the final `currentFlux` level. This deducted amount (the "flux cost of participation") contributes to the auction owner's proceeds.
5.  **Strategic Bidding:** Bidders can specify a minimum flux tolerance, subtly interacting with the dynamic system.
6.  **Outcome Estimation:** A function allows bidders to get a *non-binding estimate* of their potential outcome based on the *current* state, highlighting the uncertainty.

This goes beyond typical auction examples by adding dynamic, state-dependent outcomes and strategic complexity.

## Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** QuantumFluxAuction

**Concept:** A multi-phase auction for a conceptual digital asset ("Quantum Entangled Unit" - QEU) where bidding activity influences a dynamic "flux" level. The final settlement (loser refunds) is adjusted based on this flux, adding a layer of strategic cost and unpredictability.

**States:** `Pending`, `Active`, `Paused`, `Settling`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`
**Phases (within Active state):** `Stabilization`, `Fluctuation`, `Convergence`, `Settlement`

**State Variables:**
*   Basic auction parameters (owner, item details - conceptual, min bid, increment)
*   Auction state and phase
*   Timing (start time, phase durations, calculated end times)
*   Bid tracking (highest bid, bidder info mapping, list of bidders)
*   Dynamic state (current flux, accumulated entropy)
*   Settlement tracking (winner, claimed status)
*   Flux/Entropy parameters (factors for calculation)

**Events:**
*   `AuctionStarted`, `PhaseTransitioned`, `BidPlaced`, `BidRetracted`, `AuctionPaused`, `AuctionResumed`, `AuctionCancelled`, `SettlementInitiated`, `ItemClaimed`, `RefundClaimed`, `OwnerProceedsWithdrawn`, `ParametersUpdated`

**Function Summary (29 functions):**

**Setup & Configuration (Owner Only):**
1.  `constructor(uint256 _minBid, uint256 _bidIncrement, uint64[3] memory _phaseDurations, string memory _itemDetails)`: Initializes auction parameters and owner.
2.  `setPhaseDuration(AuctionPhase _phase, uint64 _duration)`: Sets duration for a specific phase before auction starts.
3.  `setMinBid(uint256 _minBid)`: Sets minimum bid requirement before auction starts.
4.  `setMinBidIncrement(uint256 _increment)`: Sets minimum bid increment before auction starts.
5.  `setFluxParameters(uint256 _entropyPerBidFactor, uint256 _entropyPerTimeFactor, uint256 _fluxEntropyFactor, uint256 _fluxBidFactor)`: Configures parameters for flux/entropy calculation.

**Auction Lifecycle (Owner/Trigger):**
6.  `startAuction()`: Transitions state from `Pending` to `Active` and phase to `Stabilization`.
7.  `triggerPhaseTransition()`: Allows anyone to trigger phase transition if time conditions are met. Owner can force transition.
8.  `pauseAuction()`: Owner transitions state to `Paused`.
9.  `resumeAuction()`: Owner transitions state from `Paused` to `Active`, resuming timer.
10. `cancelAuction()`: Owner transitions state to `Cancelled`, enabling refund claims.
11. `settleAuction()`: Transitions state to `Settling` and phase to `Settlement`. Determines winner and calculates final settlement parameters based on flux.

**Bidding & Participation:**
12. `placeBid(uint256 _minFluxTolerance)`: Allows participants to place a bid in ETH. Updates high bid, entropy, and flux. Requires minimum bid/increment and active state. Includes a strategic `_minFluxTolerance` parameter.
13. `retractBid()`: Allows a bidder (if not current high bidder and before `Convergence` phase) to withdraw their bid.

**Settlement & Claims:**
14. `claimItem()`: Allows the winning bidder to conceptually claim the auctioned item after settlement.
15. `claimRefunds()`: Allows losing bidders to claim their bid amount minus the flux-dependent participation cost after settlement.
16. `withdrawOwnerProceeds()`: Owner collects the winning bid amount plus the accumulated participation costs from losing bidders.

**Dynamic State Calculation (Internal/View):**
17. `_calculateFlux(uint256 _currentEntropy, uint256 _totalBidVolume)`: Internal helper to determine current flux level based on entropy and bid activity.
18. `_updateEntropy(uint256 _bidAmountDifference)`: Internal helper to accumulate entropy based on bid activity and timing.
19. `_getEffectiveParticipationCost(uint256 _finalFlux, uint256 _bidAmount, uint256 _bidFluxTolerance)`: Internal helper to calculate the amount deducted from a losing bid based on final flux and the bidder's tolerance.

**Query & View Functions:**
20. `getAuctionState()`: Returns the current state of the auction.
21. `getCurrentPhase()`: Returns the current phase of the auction.
22. `getHighBid()`: Returns details of the current highest bid.
23. `getBidDetails(address _bidder)`: Returns details for a specific bidder's bid.
24. `getFluxLevel()`: Returns the current calculated flux level.
25. `getEntropy()`: Returns the current accumulated entropy.
26. `getSettlementDetails()`: Returns details about the winner, winning bid, and final flux after settlement.
27. `getPhaseEndTime(AuctionPhase _phase)`: Returns the calculated end time for a given phase.
28. `getAuctionEndTime()`: Returns the estimated overall auction end time (end of Convergence).
29. `predictOutcomeEstimate(address _bidder)`: Provides a *non-binding estimate* of potential refund/outcome based on *current* state and hypothetical final flux. (Creative/Advanced)
