/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (Generated Example)
 * @notice A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to collaborate, curate, and monetize digital art.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership & Governance:**
 *   - `proposeMembership(address _artistAddress, string memory _reason)`: Allows existing members to propose new artists for membership.
 *   - `voteOnMembership(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on pending membership proposals.
 *   - `revokeMembership(address _artistAddress, string memory _reason)`: Allows governance to propose and vote to revoke a member's membership.
 *   - `setMembershipVoteDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows governance to set the duration of membership voting periods.
 *   - `setMembershipQuorum(uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Allows governance to set the quorum percentage required for membership votes.
 *   - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of collective members.
 *   - `isMember(address _artistAddress)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *
 * **2. Art Submission & Curation:**
 *   - `submitArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows members to submit art proposals with IPFS hash for the artwork.
 *   - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on pending art proposals.
 *   - `finalizeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Finalizes an approved art proposal, mints an NFT representing the collective art.
 *   - `setArtProposalVoteDuration(uint256 _durationInBlocks)`: Allows governance to set the duration of art proposal voting periods.
 *   - `setArtProposalQuorum(uint256 _quorumPercentage)`: Allows governance to set the quorum percentage required for art proposal votes.
 *   - `getArtProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the status of an art proposal (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
 *   - `getArtProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of art proposals submitted.
 *
 * **3. Collective NFT Management:**
 *   - `mintCollectiveNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Internal) Mints a collective NFT for an approved art proposal.
 *   - `burnCollectiveNFT(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows governance to burn a collective NFT (e.g., for removal or rights issues).
 *   - `transferCollectiveNFT(address _to, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows the collective to transfer ownership of a collective NFT (e.g., for sales, collaborations).
 *   - `getCollectiveNFTOwner(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the owner of a collective NFT.
 *   - `getCollectiveNFTContractAddress()`: Returns the address of the deployed CollectiveNFT contract.
 *
 * **4. Revenue Sharing & Treasury:**
 *   - `depositToTreasury() payable`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective treasury.
 *   - `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows governance to withdraw ETH from the treasury for collective purposes.
 *   - `setRevenueSharePercentage(uint256 _percentage)`: Allows governance to set the percentage of NFT sales revenue shared with artists.
 *   - `distributeRevenue(uint256 _tokenId)`: (Example - Triggered upon NFT sale) Distributes revenue from an NFT sale to contributing artists and treasury.
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective treasury.
 *
 * **5. Events & Collaboration (Future Expansion - Conceptual):**
 *   - `createCollectiveEvent(string memory _eventName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: (Conceptual) Function to create collective art events or exhibitions (can be expanded).
 *   - `proposeCollaboration(address _partnerContract, string memory _details)`: (Conceptual) Function to propose collaborations with other projects or artists.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**
 * - **Decentralized Curation:** Members collectively decide which art is added to the collective's portfolio through voting.
 * - **Autonomous Governance:**  Membership, rules, and treasury management are governed by on-chain voting and rules.
 * - **Collective Ownership of Art:** NFTs are minted representing art owned by the collective, not individual artists (though artists are recognized and rewarded).
 * - **Revenue Sharing Mechanism:**  Automated distribution of revenue from collective art sales to contributing artists and the treasury.
 * - **Dynamic Governance Parameters:**  Voting durations and quorums can be adjusted by governance to adapt to the collective's needs.
 * - **Potential for Expansion:** The contract structure is designed to be expandable to include more features like event management, collaboration proposals, and reputation systems.
 *
 * **Important Notes:**
 * - This is a conceptual example and requires further development and testing for production use.
 * - Security considerations are paramount in real-world smart contracts. Thorough audits are necessary.
 * - Gas optimization is important for contract efficiency.
 * - Error handling and edge case management should be robustly implemented.
 * - The `distributeRevenue` function is a simplified example and would require a more complex implementation for real-world revenue distribution based on contribution (which is not tracked in this basic example).
 * - The `CollectiveNFT` contract is assumed to be deployed and its address is set in this contract. You would need to create a separate ERC721 contract for the NFTs.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Decentralized Curation and Governance:** The core concept is a DAO for art. Members collectively decide what art becomes part of the collective through proposals and voting. This embodies decentralized curation, moving away from centralized art institutions. Membership is also governed, adding another layer of decentralization.

2.  **Collective Ownership of Art (Conceptual):** The contract *conceptually* mints NFTs in the name of the collective (represented by the contract itself, or a separate collective NFT contract). This is different from individual artists owning their NFTs. The collective owns the art, and the artists contribute and benefit from the collective's success. (The actual NFT minting part is simplified in this example for brevity and would require a separate deployed ERC721 contract and integration.)

3.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:** The voting durations and quorum percentages for both membership and art proposals are adjustable by the contract owner (governance). This allows the collective to adapt its governance rules over time, reflecting a more advanced and flexible DAO structure.

4.  **Revenue Sharing Mechanism:**  The `distributeRevenue` function (while simplified in this example) demonstrates an automated mechanism to share revenue from NFT sales. This is a key aspect of DAOs and creator economies – ensuring fair compensation and incentivizing participation.  A more advanced implementation would track individual artist contributions to each NFT for more granular revenue distribution.

5.  **Expansion Potential (Events, Collaborations):** The inclusion of conceptual functions like `createCollectiveEvent` and `proposeCollaboration` hints at the contract's potential to grow beyond just art curation. It can be expanded to manage events, collaborations with other artists or projects, creating a more dynamic and interactive art collective ecosystem.

6.  **Pause Functionality:** The `pauseContract` and `unpauseContract` functions provide a safety mechanism for emergency situations. This is a practical consideration for smart contracts, allowing governance to temporarily halt operations if critical issues arise.

**To Use this Contract (Conceptual Steps):**

1.  **Deploy a CollectiveNFT (ERC721) Contract:** You would first need to deploy a separate ERC721 contract that will represent the collective's NFTs. This contract should have minting and burning functionalities.
2.  **Deploy the `DecentralizedAutonomousArtCollective` Contract:** Deploy the Solidity code provided above, providing the address of your deployed `CollectiveNFT` contract as a constructor argument. The initial owner address will become the governance address.
3.  **Membership Proposals:** Members propose new artists. Existing members vote. If approved, the artist becomes a member.
4.  **Art Submissions:** Members submit art proposals with titles, descriptions, and IPFS hashes of their artwork.
5.  **Art Curation Voting:** Members vote on art proposals.
6.  **NFT Minting (Conceptual):** If an art proposal is approved, the `_mintCollectiveNFT` function (in a real implementation, would call the `mint` function of the `CollectiveNFT` contract) is triggered, conceptually minting an NFT representing the artwork and attributing it to the collective.
7.  **Revenue Sharing (Conceptual):** When a collective NFT is sold (this part is simplified and needs integration with a marketplace or internal sale mechanism), the `distributeRevenue` function would be called to distribute proceeds to artists (in this example, equally to all members, but could be refined to be contribution-based) and the treasury.
8.  **Governance:** The contract owner (initially the deployer) has governance rights to set parameters, revoke membership, manage the treasury, and potentially expand the contract's functionality.

**Important Disclaimer:** This is a conceptual example and is not production-ready. It would require significant further development, security audits, gas optimization, and thorough testing before being used in a real-world scenario. The NFT minting and revenue distribution parts are simplified and would need more robust implementation and integration with external systems.
