 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - No Actual Author)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit art,
 *      community members to curate and fractionalize art ownership, govern exhibitions, and participate in
 *      a self-sustaining ecosystem. This contract focuses on advanced concepts like fractionalization,
 *      DAO governance, dynamic curation, and reputation systems, going beyond typical open-source examples.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Initialization & Ownership:**
 *    - `constructor(string _collectiveName, address[] _initialCurators)`: Initializes the contract with a collective name and initial curators.
 *    - `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Allows the contract owner to transfer ownership.
 *
 * **2. Art Proposal & Submission:**
 *    - `submitArtProposal(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Artists submit art proposals with title, description, and IPFS hash.
 *    - `updateArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Artists update their submitted art proposals before curation.
 *    - `cancelArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Artists can cancel their art proposals before curation.
 *
 * **3. Curation & Voting:**
 *    - `addCurator(address _curator)`: Owner function to add new curators.
 *    - `removeCurator(address _curator)`: Owner function to remove curators.
 *    - `proposeArtForCuration(uint256 _proposalId)`: Curators propose an art proposal for community curation voting.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Community members vote on art proposals proposed for curation.
 *    - `finalizeArtProposalCuration(uint256 _proposalId)`: Owner/Curator function to finalize curation after voting period.
 *    - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to check the curation status of an art proposal.
 *
 * **4. Fractionalization & Ownership:**
 *    - `fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Owner/Curator function to fractionalize approved art into ERC1155 tokens.
 *    - `redeemFractionalShares(uint256 _artId, uint256 _amount)`: Holders of fractional shares can redeem them to potentially claim a portion of future revenue (example use case, can be customized).
 *    - `getFractionalSharesBalance(uint256 _artId, address _holder)`: View function to check the balance of fractional shares for a holder.
 *
 * **5. Exhibition Management:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Owner/Curator function to create a new art exhibition.
 *    - `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Owner/Curator function to add approved art to an exhibition.
 *    - `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artId)`: Owner/Curator function to remove art from an exhibition.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: View function to retrieve details of an exhibition.
 *
 * **6. DAO Governance & Proposals:**
 *    - `createGovernanceProposal(string _proposalTitle, string _proposalDescription, bytes _calldata)`: Community members can create governance proposals for contract changes.
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Community members vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Owner function to execute approved governance proposals (carefully designed).
 *    - `getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to get details of a governance proposal.
 *
 * **7. Utility & Information:**
 *    - `getArtProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: View function to get details of an art proposal.
 *    - `getApprovedArtIds()`: View function to retrieve a list of approved art IDs.
 *    - `isCurator(address _account)`: View function to check if an address is a curator.
 *    - `getCollectiveName()`: View function to get the name of the art collective.

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):**  The core idea is to create a community-driven art collective that operates transparently and autonomously via a smart contract.

2.  **Art Proposal & Curation Process:**
    *   **Submission:** Artists submit their art proposals, including metadata and IPFS links.
    *   **Curation:** Curators (initially set by the contract owner, potentially governed later by the DAO) propose submitted art for community voting.
    *   **Community Voting:** Community members (anyone, or potentially token holders in a more advanced version) vote on whether to accept the proposed art into the collective.
    *   **Finalization:** Curators finalize the curation based on voting results and quorum. This introduces a decentralized art selection process.

3.  **Fractionalization of Art Ownership (ERC1155):**
    *   Approved art can be fractionalized into ERC1155 tokens. This represents shared ownership of the digital art piece.
    *   `fractionalizeArt()` mints ERC1155 tokens for a given artwork ID.
    *   `redeemFractionalShares()` is a placeholder example. In a real application, redeeming shares could unlock benefits like:
        *   Claiming a portion of future revenue generated by the artwork (e.g., if the collective sells prints or licenses the art).
        *   Gaining voting power in the DAO related to that specific artwork.
        *   Access to exclusive content related to the artwork.
    *   ERC1155 is used because it's efficient for managing multiple quantities of the same fractional share token.

4.  **Exhibition Management:**
    *   Curators can create digital art exhibitions within the contract.
    *   Approved and potentially fractionalized art can be added to exhibitions.
    *   This allows for curated digital art showcases governed by the collective.

5.  **DAO Governance & Proposals:**
    *   The contract incorporates basic DAO governance.
    *   Community members can create governance proposals to modify contract parameters or suggest actions for the collective.
    *   `createGovernanceProposal()` allows proposing changes with `calldata` that can execute contract functions.
    *   `voteOnGovernanceProposal()` allows community voting on proposals.
    *   `executeGovernanceProposal()` (owner-controlled for security) executes approved proposals. **Caution:** Governance execution needs to be carefully designed and audited to prevent malicious proposals.
    *   Governance can be used to change curators, voting durations, quorum percentages, add new functionalities, etc., making the collective more self-governing over time.

6.  **Curator Roles:**
    *   Curators are designated addresses with special privileges (proposing curation, managing exhibitions, fractionalization).
    *   Curator roles can be managed by the contract owner initially, and later potentially by DAO governance itself.

7.  **Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted for key actions (proposal submissions, voting, fractionalization, exhibitions, governance) to enable off-chain tracking and UI updates.

8.  **Advanced Concepts:**
    *   **Decentralized Curation:**  Shifts art selection power from individuals to a community voting process.
    *   **Fractional Ownership:** Democratizes access to and ownership of digital art.
    *   **DAO Governance:**  Enables community-led evolution and management of the art collective.
    *   **Dynamic Exhibition Platform:** Creates a platform for showcasing and contextualizing digital art within the blockchain ecosystem.

9.  **Non-Duplication from Open Source:**  While using OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC1155 and Ownable for standard functionalities is efficient and secure, the overall concept, the combination of features (curation + fractionalization + DAO + exhibitions), and the specific logic within functions are designed to be unique and go beyond typical open-source examples like simple token contracts or basic DAOs.

**Important Notes and Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Gas Optimization:** This contract is designed for functionality and concept demonstration. Gas optimization would be crucial for a production-ready contract (e.g., array handling, event data, storage optimizations).
*   **Voting Power & Reputation:**  In a real DAO, voting power should likely be weighted based on factors like:
    *   Holding fractional shares of art.
    *   Staking tokens in the collective.
    *   Reputation earned through participation (e.g., successful curation votes, contributions).
*   **Revenue Generation & Distribution:**  The contract currently lacks a clear revenue model.  A real DAAC might explore:
    *   Selling fractional shares.
    *   Charging fees for exhibitions.
    *   Selling prints or merchandise related to the art.
    *   Donations.
    *   Revenue distribution mechanisms to fractional share holders and the collective itself need to be defined.
*   **Security Audits:**  Any smart contract dealing with value should undergo rigorous security audits before deployment.
*   **Off-Chain Infrastructure:**  A real DAAC would require off-chain infrastructure for:
    *   Storing and serving art metadata and IPFS content.
    *   Building a user interface for interaction.
    *   Snapshotting voting and participation for reputation systems.
*   **Scalability and Layer 2 Solutions:** For a large-scale DAAC, consider scalability solutions and potentially Layer 2 technologies to reduce transaction costs.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Considerations:**  DAOs and fractionalized ownership of assets have legal and regulatory implications that need to be considered based on jurisdiction.

This contract provides a foundation for a sophisticated and trendy decentralized art collective. You can further expand upon these features and concepts to create a truly unique and innovative blockchain-based art ecosystem.
