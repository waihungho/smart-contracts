Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's create a smart contract that combines a few advanced, creative, and trendy concepts:

1.  **Simulated Quantum State:** A core element whose state is initially uncertain (superposition) and only becomes definite upon interaction (measurement). This isn't *actual* quantum computing, but a simulation of its *principles* using probabilistic state transitions on-chain.
2.  **Entanglement (Simulated):** Actions on one part of the system can influence the state probabilities of another linked part.
3.  **On-Chain Game/Puzzle:** A game where players interact with this "quantum" system to find a hidden treasure.
4.  **Decentralized Governance:** A DAO-like structure for players to propose and vote on changes to the game rules, parameters, or outcomes, influencing the "quantum" simulation itself.
5.  **Dynamic NFTs (Conceptual):** Players could hold NFTs representing their "particles" or clues, whose properties might change based on the quantum state collapse or entanglement resolution (though we won't implement the full NFT standard here, just the state changes).
6.  **Prize Pool:** A mechanism for players to contribute funds, distributed upon finding the treasure.

Let's call this contract `QuantumTreasureHunt`.

## QuantumTreasureHunt Smart Contract

This contract simulates a treasure hunt game based on probabilistic state transitions ("quantum collapse"), linked states ("entanglement"), and governed by player proposals.

### Outline

1.  **State Variables:** Define the core data structures for the grid, cells, particles, players, governance proposals, and game parameters.
2.  **Events:** Declare events to log important actions and state changes.
3.  **Enums & Structs:** Define custom types for game status, cell states, particle types, and proposal structures.
4.  **Modifiers:** Define access control and state-checking modifiers.
5.  **Game Setup & Control:** Functions for initializing, starting, and ending the game.
6.  **Player Management:** Functions for players to register and manage their state.
7.  **Core Game Logic:** Functions for interacting with the grid (explore/measure), moving particles, and resolving entanglement.
8.  **Prize Pool:** Functions for contributing to and claiming the prize.
9.  **Decentralized Governance (DAO):** Functions for creating, voting on, and executing proposals to modify game parameters or resolve issues.
10. **View Functions:** Functions to query the state of the game, players, grid, and proposals.

### Function Summary

Here are 25+ functions planned to exceed the requirement and cover the features:

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with basic parameters.
2.  `setGameParameters(uint _gridWidth, uint _gridHeight, uint _maxParticles, address payable _treasury)`: Sets initial game dimensions and treasury address (callable only in `Setup` state).
3.  `addInitialCellStateProbability(uint _x, uint _y, CellState _state, uint _probability)`: Configures the initial probabilistic superposition for a cell (callable only in `Setup` state). Sum of probabilities for a cell must be 10000 (for 4 decimals).
4.  `addInitialParticle(ParticleType _pType, uint _initialX, uint _initialY)`: Adds a particle to the grid at a starting position (callable only in `Setup` state).
5.  `startGame()`: Transitions the game state from `Setup` to `Active`.
6.  `endGame()`: Transitions the game state to `Ended` (callable by admin or via governance).
7.  `registerPlayer()`: Allows an address to join the game as a player. Requires a small fee or stake.
8.  `exploreCell(uint _x, uint _y)`: The core "measurement" action. Triggers a probabilistic collapse of the cell's state based on its current superposition and influences.
9.  `moveParticle(uint _particleId, uint _newX, uint _newY)`: Player attempts to move a particle they control (or maybe any particle if rules allow) to a new valid location. Movement might be restricted or probabilistic (simulated quantum walk).
10. `attemptEntangleLink(uint _x1, uint _y1, uint _x2, uint _y2)`: Players can propose linking two cells. If successful (might require cost or condition), collapsing one affects the other's probabilities.
11. `resolveEntanglement(uint _linkId)`: Triggers the probabilistic influence of an entangled link on the target cell's superposition probabilities without necessarily collapsing it yet.
12. `depositPrizeContribution()`: Allows anyone to contribute Ether to the treasure prize pool.
13. `claimPrize()`: Called by the winner(s) after the treasure is found and game ends.
14. `createProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Players can create governance proposals. `_calldata` contains the encoded function call and arguments for execution.
15. `voteOnProposal(uint _proposalId, bool _support)`: Players cast their vote (yay or nay) on a proposal. Voting power might be based on stake or game participation.
16. `executeProposal(uint _proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal whose voting period has ended and passed the threshold.
17. `delegateVote(address _delegate)`: Delegate voting power to another address.
18. `revokeDelegate()`: Revoke delegated voting power.
19. `getGameStatus()`: View function to get the current state of the game.
20. `getGridSize()`: View function to get the dimensions of the grid.
21. `getGridCellState(uint _x, uint _y)`: View function to get the current (collapsed) state of a cell. Returns `Unknown` if not yet collapsed.
22. `getGridCellPotentialStates(uint _x, uint _y)`: View function to see the current probabilistic distribution of states for a cell *before* collapse. (Requires careful internal state representation).
23. `getParticlePosition(uint _particleId)`: View function to get a particle's current grid coordinates.
24. `getPlayerInfo(address _player)`: View function to get a player's registration status, associated particle(s), and voting power.
25. `getEntangledLinks()`: View function to get a list of active entangled links.
26. `getProposalState(uint _proposalId)`: View function to get the status and details of a governance proposal.
27. `getPrizePoolBalance()`: View function to check the total Ether held for the prize.
28. `getWinner()`: View function to see the address(es) of the winner(s) once the game is ended by finding the treasure.
29. `getTreasuryAddress()`: View function for the treasury wallet.

**Explanation of Concepts and Implementation:**

1.  **Simulated Quantum State:**
    *   Cells have a `CellState` enum. `Unknown` represents superposition.
    *   `potentialStateProbabilities` mapping stores the probability distribution for `Unknown` cells. Probabilities sum up to `PROBABILITY_SCALE` (10000 for 100%).
    *   `exploreCell` is the "measurement". It uses a pseudo-random number (`_pseudoRandomNumber`) to pick an outcome state based on the current probabilities.
    *   The `isCollapsed` flag tracks if a cell's state is definite.

2.  **Entanglement (Simulated):**
    *   `EntanglementLink` struct stores a link between two cells and defines how collapsing `cell1` influences the probabilities of `cell2`.
    *   `cell2ProbabilityInfluence` mapping within the link determines *how* specific outcomes in `cell1` (keys) add modifier points to probabilities of states in `cell2`.
    *   `attemptEntangleLink` allows players to try and create these links (probabilistically or based on rules).
    *   `resolveEntanglement` (called potentially within `exploreCell` or as a separate action) applies the stored `stateProbabilityModifiers` to the target cell based on the source cell's *collapsed* state. These modifiers adjust the probabilities *before* the target cell is itself collapsed.

3.  **On-Chain Game/Puzzle:**
    *   The grid and particles represent the game board and elements.
    *   `exploreCell` and `moveParticle` are the primary player actions.
    *   Finding the `Treasure` state in a cell wins the game (`winner` is set, `endGame` is called).
    *   `_applyStateEffects` demonstrates how different collapsed states can have in-game consequences beyond just revealing information.

4.  **Decentralized Governance (DAO):**
    *   `Player` struct includes `votingPower` and `delegate`.
    *   `Proposal` struct stores details about proposed changes. `callData` and `targetContract` allow proposals to trigger functions *within this contract* (or potentially other linked contracts if designed).
    *   `createProposal` allows players with enough power to propose changes.
    *   `voteOnProposal` handles voting, including delegation (`delegateVote`, `revokeDelegate`).
    *   `executeProposal` checks if a proposal met the quorum and majority thresholds and then attempts to execute the stored `callData`.
    *   `totalVotingSupply` tracks the total power for quorum calculation. (Simplified, ideally updated on power changes).

5.  **Dynamic NFTs (Conceptual):**
    *   While full ERC-721 is not implemented, the `Particle` struct could easily be linked to an NFT ID.
    *   The particle's position or properties (`controlledBy`, `name`, potentially other custom fields) could be stored here and represent dynamic traits of the associated NFT, updated by `moveParticle` or `_applyStateEffects`.

6.  **Prize Pool:**
    *   `depositPrizeContribution` allows adding Ether.
    *   `claimPrize` allows the determined `winner` to withdraw the contract's balance.

**Advanced Concepts Used:**

*   **Probabilistic State Transitions:** Simulating quantum collapse on-chain using random number generation (acknowledging the security risks of on-chain randomness).
*   **State Influence/Linking:** Implementing "entanglement" where actions in one part of the system modify probabilities in another linked part.
*   **Generic Function Execution:** Using `callData` in proposals for the DAO to execute arbitrary functions on the contract itself (or others), enabling complex governance actions.
*   **Delegated Voting:** A standard DAO pattern implemented for governance.
*   **Complex State Management:** Handling a 2D grid with dynamic cell states and associated data.

**Non-Duplication:**

While individual components (basic DAOs, prize pools, grids) exist in open source, the combination of a probabilistic "quantum" state simulation with simulated entanglement as a core game mechanic, layered with a DAO that can influence these mechanics via arbitrary calls, is a unique design. The specific state transition and entanglement logic defined here is not a standard open-source pattern.

**Important Considerations for Production:**

*   **Randomness:** The internal pseudo-randomness (`_pseudoRandomNumber`) is insecure and easily exploitable in a real game. Use a secure oracle (like Chainlink VRF) or a well-designed commit-reveal scheme.
*   **Gas Costs:** A contract with this much state and logic can become expensive, especially functions like `exploreCell` depending on how probability resolution scales or `executeProposal` depending on the complexity of the called function. Careful optimization and potentially breaking down logic or state is necessary.
*   **Scalability:** Large grids, many particles, or numerous entanglement links could strain gas limits and storage costs.
*   **Security Audit:** A contract managing funds and complex state transitions requires a thorough security audit. Arbitrary execution via DAO proposals is powerful but must be carefully restricted and secured.
*   **Player Voting Power:** The current model is very simple (1 power per player). A real DAO would likely tie this to staked tokens, activity, or other metrics.
*   **Entanglement Influence Logic:** The `cell2ProbabilityInfluence` and `resolveEntanglement` logic is basic. A real game would need carefully designed rules for how states and links affect probabilities to create interesting gameplay.
*   **State Iteration:** Iterating through mapping keys (like `potentialStateProbabilities`) is not directly supported. The `getGridCellPotentialStates` and the state resolution loop in `exploreCell` had to use predefined lists of states as a workaround. A better approach for variable states might require different data structures.

This contract provides a framework demonstrating the concepts. Building a full, production-ready game on top would require significant expansion, refinement, and robust security measures.
