Okay, let's design a complex, creative, and advanced smart contract. We'll build a "Decentralized Knowledge Forge" - a platform for submitting, validating, challenging, and curating knowledge fragments using concepts like staking, reputation, time-based phases, dispute resolution by a council, and placeholders for advanced verification methods like ZK proofs and AI oracle outcomes.

This contract goes beyond simple token transfers or basic NFT minting by incorporating a multi-stage lifecycle for knowledge items, a reputation system, staking incentives with slashing, and integrating concepts relevant to verifiable computation and off-chain intelligence (via hashes/outcomes).

---

**Contract Name:** DecentralizedKnowledgeForge

**Concept:** A decentralized platform for submitting, validating, and curating knowledge items. Users stake tokens to endorse (validate) or dispute (challenge) items. A reputation system tracks user performance. Challenged items enter a dispute phase, potentially resolved by a Validator Council or based on AI Oracle input. Successful participants earn rewards from a token pool and potentially slashed stakes.

**Advanced Concepts & Features:**
1.  **Multi-Stage Item Lifecycle:** Items progress through Pending, Validation, Challenge, Dispute, Finalized states.
2.  **Staking & Slashing:** Participants stake tokens to validate or challenge, with stakes slashed for incorrect outcomes.
3.  **Reputation System:** On-chain tracking of user performance (correct validations/challenges/votes).
4.  **Validator Council:** A privileged group for dispute resolution voting.
5.  **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Timed voting phase for challenged items.
6.  **Reward Distribution:** Participants on the 'correct' side of a resolution share staked and potentially slashed tokens.
7.  **ZK Proof Integration (Placeholder):** Allows submitters to associate a ZK proof hash with knowledge for off-chain verification reference.
8.  **AI Oracle Integration (Placeholder):** Allows a designated oracle to record an AI's assessment outcome, potentially influencing dispute resolution or state.
9.  **Parameter Governance:** Owner can set key contract parameters (stake amounts, durations, oracle address).
10. **Extensive View Functions:** Detailed insights into items, users, and contract state.

**Outline & Function Summary:**

*   **I. State Variables & Data Structures**
    *   Enums for Item State and Dispute Outcome.
    *   Structs for KnowledgeItem, UserProfile, Stake.
    *   Mappings to store items, user profiles, stakes, council members, oracle address.
    *   Counters for item IDs and stake IDs.
    *   Configuration parameters (staking amounts, durations, reward token).
*   **II. Events**
    *   `KnowledgeItemSubmitted`, `ItemStateChanged`, `Staked`, `StakeWithdrawn`, `DisputeVoted`, `DisputeFinalized`, `RewardsClaimed`, `UserProfileUpdated`, `CouncilMemberAdded`, `CouncilMemberRemoved`, `OracleAddressSet`, `ParametersUpdated`.
*   **III. Modifiers**
    *   `onlyOwner`, `onlyValidatorCouncil`, `onlyOracle`, `whenItemIsInState`, `whenStakeExists`.
*   **IV. Constructor**
    *   Initializes owner, reward token address (can be zero initially), and potentially initial council members.
*   **V. Admin & Configuration (6 Functions)**
    1.  `constructor(address initialRewardToken, address[] initialCouncilMembers)`: Deploys the contract.
    2.  `setRewardToken(address newRewardToken)`: Sets the address of the ERC-20 token used for rewards.
    3.  `addValidatorCouncilMember(address member)`: Adds a new member to the Validator Council.
    4.  `removeValidatorCouncilMember(address member)`: Removes a member from the Validator Council.
    5.  `setStakingAmounts(uint256 validationStake, uint256 challengeStake)`: Sets the required staking amounts for validation and challenges.
    6.  `setPhaseDurations(uint40 validationDuration, uint40 challengeDuration, uint40 disputeDuration)`: Sets the time durations for each item phase.
*   **VI. Knowledge Item Management (3 Functions)**
    7.  `submitKnowledgeItem(bytes32 knowledgeDataHash, string memory metadataUri, uint256 categoryId)`: Submits a new knowledge item, starts in PENDING state.
    8.  `submitZKProofHash(uint256 itemId, bytes32 zkProofHash)`: Allows the original submitter to associate a ZK proof hash (reference for off-chain verification). Can only be called once and before validation/challenge.
    9.  `recordOracleAIValidationOutcome(uint256 itemId, uint8 outcomeCode, bytes32 outcomeDetailsHash)`: Authorized Oracle records an AI's assessment outcome, influencing item state or dispute (outcomeCode semantics defined off-chain).
*   **VII. Participation & Staking (3 Functions)**
    10. `stakeAndValidate(uint256 itemId)`: Stakes tokens to endorse an item during its Validation phase.
    11. `stakeAndChallenge(uint256 itemId, bytes32 challengeEvidenceHash)`: Stakes tokens to dispute an item during its Challenge phase. Requires evidence hash.
    12. `withdrawStake(uint256 stakeId)`: Allows a user to withdraw their stake if the item is finalized and they were on the correct side.
*   **VIII. Dispute Resolution & Lifecycle (5 Functions)**
    13. `finalizeValidationPhase(uint256 itemId)`: Moves item from VALIDATION to CHALLENGE or FINALIZED based on time and challenges.
    14. `finalizeChallengePhase(uint256 itemId)`: Moves item from CHALLENGE to DISPUTE or FINALIZED based on time.
    15. `voteOnDispute(uint256 itemId, bool supportsOriginalItem)`: Validator Council members vote on challenged items during the DISPUTE phase.
    16. `finalizeDisputePhase(uint256 itemId)`: Moves item from DISPUTE to FINALIZED, calculates outcome based on council votes and AI outcome, distributes rewards/slashed stakes.
    17. `cancelItem(uint256 itemId, string memory reason)`: Allows owner/council to cancel an item (e.g., for spam, off-chain policy violation). All stakes are returned.
*   **IX. User & Rewards (2 Functions)**
    18. `getUserProfile(address user)`: Views a user's reputation and stake count.
    19. `claimRewards()`: Allows a user to claim their accumulated reward tokens and withdraw eligible stakes.
*   **X. View Functions & Getters (5 Functions)**
    20. `getKnowledgeItemDetails(uint256 itemId)`: Returns detailed information about a knowledge item.
    21. `getValidatorCouncil()`: Returns the list of Validator Council members.
    22. `getItemStakes(uint256 itemId)`: Returns a list of stake IDs associated with an item.
    23. `getStakeDetails(uint256 stakeId)`: Returns details of a specific stake.
