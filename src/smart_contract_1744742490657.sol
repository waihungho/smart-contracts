/**
 * @title Dynamic Feature Control and Access Management Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This contract implements a dynamic feature control and access management system.
 * It allows the contract owner to enable or disable features, manage roles for different access levels,
 * implement rate limiting for specific features, and introduce circuit breakers for emergency situations.
 * It also includes functionalities for data verification and decentralized communication,
 * aiming to provide a comprehensive and flexible smart contract framework.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Ownership and Administration:**
 *    - `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Allows the owner to transfer contract ownership.
 *    - `renounceOwnership()`: Allows the owner to renounce ownership, making the contract ownerless.
 *
 * 2. **Feature Management:**
 *    - `enableFeature(string memory featureName)`: Enables a specific feature.
 *    - `disableFeature(string memory featureName)`: Disables a specific feature.
 *    - `isFeatureEnabled(string memory featureName) view returns (bool)`: Checks if a feature is enabled.
 *    - `describeFeature(string memory featureName, string memory description)`: Sets or updates the description of a feature.
 *    - `getFeatureDescription(string memory featureName) view returns (string memory)`: Retrieves the description of a feature.
 *    - `listFeatures() view returns (string[] memory)`: Lists all registered features.
 *
 * 3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
 *    - `addRole(address account, string memory roleName)`: Assigns a role to an account.
 *    - `removeRole(address account, string memory roleName)`: Removes a role from an account.
 *    - `hasRole(address account, string memory roleName) view returns (bool)`: Checks if an account has a specific role.
 *    - `checkRole(address account, string memory roleName)`: Modifier to check if an account has a specific role.
 *
 * 4. **Rate Limiting:**
 *    - `setRateLimit(string memory featureName, uint256 limit, uint256 window)`: Sets a rate limit for a feature.
 *    - `getRateLimit(string memory featureName) view returns (uint256, uint256)`: Retrieves the rate limit for a feature.
 *    - `checkRateLimit(string memory featureName)`: Modifier to enforce rate limiting for a feature.
 *
 * 5. **Circuit Breaker:**
 *    - `activateCircuitBreaker(string memory breakerName)`: Activates a circuit breaker.
 *    - `deactivateCircuitBreaker(string memory breakerName)`: Deactivates a circuit breaker.
 *    - `isCircuitBreakerActive(string memory breakerName) view returns (bool)`: Checks if a circuit breaker is active.
 *    - `checkCircuitBreaker(string memory breakerName)`: Modifier to check if a circuit breaker is active.
 *
 * 6. **Data Verification (Simple Oracle Example):**
 *    - `requestDataVerification(string memory dataHash, string memory description)`: Requests data verification.
 *    - `verifyData(uint256 requestId, bool isValid, string memory verificationDetails)`: Verifies data based on a request.
 *    - `getDataVerificationStatus(uint256 requestId) view returns (bool, string memory)`: Gets the verification status of a data request.
 *
 * 7. **Decentralized Communication (Simple Event-Based Messaging):**
 *    - `sendMessage(address recipient, string memory message)`: Sends a message to another address via events.
 *    - `readMessages() view returns (string[] memory)`:  (Simulated read - events are off-chain, but this shows intent).
 *
 * 8. **Utility and Information:**
 *    - `getContractDetails() view returns (string memory, address)`: Returns contract name and owner.
 *    - `getFunctionSignatures() view returns (bytes4[] memory)`: Returns function signatures of the contract.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - **Ownership & Admin:** Manage contract ownership.
 * - **Feature Management:** Enable, disable, and describe features dynamically.
 * - **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement and manage roles for access control.
 * - **Rate Limiting:** Protect features from overuse with rate limits.
 * - **Circuit Breaker:** Implement emergency stop mechanisms.
 * - **Data Verification:** Simple data verification request/response system.
 * - **Decentralized Communication:** Basic event-based messaging.
 * - **Utility & Information:** Contract metadata and function information.
