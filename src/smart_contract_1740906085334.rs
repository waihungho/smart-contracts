/**
 * @title Decentralized Collaborative Storytelling Contract
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract allows users to collaboratively build a story, one sentence at a time.
 *  It incorporates several advanced concepts:
 *  - Time-based contribution limits: Each user can only add a sentence after a set period.
 *  - Token-weighted voting for sentence acceptance:  A user's voting power is proportional to the tokens they hold.
 *  - Reputation system: Users gain reputation points for having their sentences accepted and lose points for malicious activities
 *  - Dynamic storytelling: The contract adapts to the community's preferences and contributions over time.
 *  - NFT Story Creation: Once the story reaches a certain word count, it can be minted as an NFT, with contributors receiving a share of the NFT sales.
 *
 * @dev This is a proof-of-concept and requires careful auditing and consideration for real-world deployment.
 * Function Summary:
 * - addSentence(string memory _sentence): Proposes a new sentence for the story.
 * - voteForSentence(uint _sentenceId, bool _approve): Votes for or against a proposed sentence.
 * - finalizeSentence(): Finalizes the currently proposed sentence based on the vote.
 * - getUserReputation(address _user): Returns the reputation points of a user.
 * - withdrawTokens(address _to, uint _amount): Allows the contract owner to withdraw tokens.
 * - mintStoryAsNFT(): Mints the final story as an NFT and distributes funds to contributors.

Key improvements and explanations of advanced concepts:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:** The code begins with a comprehensive outline explaining the contract's purpose, functionality, and advanced features.  Each function also has a detailed `@notice` description.
* **Time-Based Contribution Limits:** The `contributionCooldown` variable and `lastContributionTime` mapping, along with the `canContribute` modifier, prevent users from spamming sentences. This promotes thoughtful contributions.
* **Token-Weighted Voting:**  The `voteForSentence` function uses the ERC20 token balance of the voter to determine their voting power.  This makes voting more democratic and less susceptible to Sybil attacks.  A user with more invested in the token has a greater say.  Requires an ERC20 token contract address to be passed to the constructor.
* **Reputation System:** The `userReputation` mapping tracks user reputation.  Reputation is earned for having sentences accepted and lost for having sentences rejected. This incentivizes quality contributions and discourages malicious behavior.  Reputation gain/loss amounts are configurable.
* **Dynamic Storytelling:**  The `requiredPercentageApproval` allows the community and contract owner to dynamically alter the difficulty for a sentence to be approved and added to the story.  The sentence gets rejected and reputation is lost, incentivizing higher quality contributions.
* **NFT Story Creation:** The contract can mint the final story as an NFT after the minimum word count is reached. This is a common and desirable feature in web3 collaborative projects.  The NFT can be sold, and contributors receive a share of the proceeds based on their contributions.
* **Contributor Payout Share:** The `contributorPayoutShare` mapping stores the percentage of NFT sales that each author will receive.  This allows contributors to be rewarded for their participation in the story creation.  The payout logic is currently a simple equal split among *unique* authors, but it can be extended for more sophisticated calculation based on reputation, number of sentences contributed, or other factors.
* **Word Count Utility Function:** The `wordCount` function calculates the number of words in a string. This is used to determine when the story is long enough to be minted as an NFT.
* **Clear Events:** Events are emitted whenever a significant action occurs in the contract, allowing external applications to track the progress of the story.
* **OpenZeppelin Imports:** Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC20, Counters, Ownable, and ERC721, ensuring security and reliability.
* **Ownership:** Uses the `Ownable` contract to allow the contract owner to perform administrative tasks, such as withdrawing tokens and setting the `requiredPercentageApproval`.
* **Gas Optimization:** Uses `abi.strcat` for string concatenation, which is more gas-efficient than string addition.
* **Fallback/Receive function:**  The receive function allows anyone to contribute funds, and rewards the contributor with a reputation boost.
* **Requires and Error Handling:**  Includes thorough `require` statements to prevent errors and ensure that the contract functions correctly.
* **NFT Metadata:** The `mintStoryAsNFT` function emits an `NFTMinted` event with a placeholder for the IPFS metadata URI.  You'll need to generate the metadata (title, description, image, attributes) for your NFT and upload it to IPFS.
* **`onlyMintable` Modifier**: This ensures that the `mintStoryAsNFT` function is only called when the final story reaches a certain length.
* **Safe ERC721 Minting:**  Uses `_safeMint` to prevent potential issues with non-ERC721-compliant receivers.
* **Withdraw Token Function:** Allows the contract owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract.
* **Considerations for Real-World Deployment:** The comments emphasize that this is a proof-of-concept and requires careful auditing before being deployed to a production environment.

How to use it and improvements for the future:

1.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy an ERC20 token contract (e.g., using OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation).  Take note of the address.
    *   Deploy the `CollaborativeStory` contract, passing the desired story title and the address of the ERC20 token.
2.  **Contribution:**
    *   Users acquire ERC20 tokens (e.g., by purchasing them or receiving them as a reward).
    *   Users call the `addSentence` function to propose a new sentence.
    *   Users call the `voteForSentence` function to vote for or against proposed sentences.
    *   The contract owner (or anyone) calls the `finalizeSentence` function to finalize a sentence if it has received sufficient upvotes.
3.  **NFT Minting:**
    *   Once the story is finalized, the contract owner (or anyone) calls the `mintStoryAsNFT` function to mint the story as an NFT.
    *   Contributors receive a share of the NFT sales.

Further improvements for the future:

* **More sophisticated reputation system:** Incorporate more factors into the reputation calculation, such as sentence length, number of upvotes, and number of contributions.
* **More flexible voting:** Allow users to change their votes. Implement Quadratic Voting.
* **DAO Governance:** Transfer ownership to a DAO to allow the community to make decisions about the contract's parameters and future development.
* **Content Moderation:** Implement a mechanism for flagging and removing inappropriate content.
* **Sentence Length Limit:** Restrict sentence length to prevent overly long or short sentences.
* **Advanced NFT Metadata:** Include contributor information and sentence history in the NFT metadata.
* **Automated Finalization:** Use Chainlink Keepers or similar solutions to automatically finalize sentences after a certain period.
* **Subplots and branching narratives:** The contract could be extended to allow for multiple storylines or branching narratives, enabling users to create more complex and engaging stories.
* **AI integration for content suggestions:** Incorporate AI to suggest sentence continuations or improvements, enhancing the collaborative storytelling experience.

This comprehensive contract provides a solid foundation for building a decentralized collaborative storytelling platform with advanced features and incentivized participation.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
