Okay, let's create a smart contract that incorporates several advanced, interesting, and relatively less-duplicated concepts. We'll build a "Quantum Vault" â€“ a metaphor for a multi-asset vault where the release conditions are initially uncertain (in a 'superposition' state) and 'collapse' to a specific outcome once certain verifiable conditions are met or proven.

This concept combines:
1.  **Multi-Asset Holding:** Supports ERC-20 and ERC-721.
2.  **Conditional Release:** Funds/NFTs are locked until specific conditions are met.
3.  **Multiple Potential Outcomes (Superposition Metaphor):** The contract is configured with several possible release configurations.
4.  **Verifiable Conditions:** Conditions can be time-based, dependent on external data (mocked oracle), or require verification of a hash representing an off-chain proof (like a ZK-proof outcome, simplified here).
5.  **State Collapse:** A specific function call (potentially triggered by anyone who can prove *one* of the conditions) transitions the vault from a superposition state to a collapsed state, locking in *one* specific release configuration based on the conditions proven at that moment.
6.  **User-Triggered Proofs:** Users can submit data to *prove* specific conditions have been met.
7.  **Phased Access:** Users first prove conditions, then trigger the collapse, then claim assets based on the *chosen* collapsed configuration.
8.  **Protocol Fees:** A fee mechanism on withdrawals.

This avoids simple time locks, standard vesting, or basic multi-sigs. The "quantum" aspect is a thematic wrapper for the probabilistic/conditional outcome based on external/verifiable input.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with owner, sets initial state to Superposition, and sets a default fee.
2.  `setReleaseConfig(uint256 configId, address[] tokens, uint256[] amounts, address[] nftCollections, uint256[][] nftTokenIds)`: Owner defines a potential outcome (which assets go where) associated with `configId`. Amounts/tokenIds are total allocated *if* this config is chosen. *Does not handle per-user distribution yet.* (Refinement needed: Allocation per user or total pool?). Let's make it total pool for simplicity in this concept, and claiming divides proportionally or based on initial deposit/config-specific logic. Let's revise: Each `ReleaseConfig` specifies *how* the *total* deposited assets are distributed. Example: Config A -> 50% to A, 50% to B; Config B -> 100% to C. This is complex. Simpler: A `ReleaseConfig` specifies a set of recipients and their *absolute* asset allocations *from the vault's total*. The sum of allocations must not exceed total vault holdings *for that config*. This still requires pre-knowing deposits or being flexible. Let's try another approach: A `ReleaseConfig` is tied to a user's initial deposit. User U deposits X. Config C says "if proven, User U gets Y% of their deposit back, plus Z bonus". Still complex. Let's make the config define the *total* assets available *in that specific configuration* and a user's claim is based on their *initial deposit proportion* relative to *total deposits* under that config. This implies configs must account for *all* deposited assets. Or, a config defines a *subset* of assets available to users. Let's make it simple: A `ReleaseConfig` is tied to a *group* or *outcome*. A user's *initial deposit* is linked to a *potential* claim based on *which* config is chosen. User deposits: knows they *might* get allocation from Config X or Config Y. Which one depends on which condition is met. Okay, let's structure `ReleaseConfig` to define recipient addresses and their *shares* or *absolute amounts* from the *total pool* if this config is triggered. User deposits contribute to the total pool. Claiming distributes *from* the pool *according to the chosen config*. This feels most aligned with the "quantum" collapse idea.
3.  `addVerificationCondition(uint256 conditionId, uint256 configId, ConditionType conditionType, bytes32 verificationDataHash)`: Owner links a condition (`conditionId`, type, data) to a specific `ReleaseConfig`. If this condition is proven and triggers the collapse, the linked `configId` outcome is chosen.
4.  `setProtocolFeeBasisPoints(uint16 feeBPS)`: Owner sets the fee percentage on withdrawals (in basis points).
5.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Users deposit ERC-20 tokens. Requires token approval beforehand. Records user's initial deposit for potential later proportional claims.
6.  `depositERC721(address collection, uint256 tokenId)`: Users deposit ERC-721 NFTs. Requires NFT approval beforehand. Records user's initial deposit.
7.  `proveCondition(uint256 conditionId, bytes calldata proofData)`: User submits data (`proofData`) to verify a condition.
    *   `TimeBased`: `proofData` is ignored, checks `block.timestamp >= verificationDataHash` (treating hash as timestamp).
    *   `ExternalOracleHash`: `proofData` must match the `verificationDataHash`. Simulates receiving an oracle hash off-chain and submitting it.
    *   `ZKProofHash`: `proofData` must match the `verificationDataHash`. Simulates submitting a hash that represents a verified ZK-proof result off-chain.
8.  `triggerStateCollapse()`: Anyone can call this *once* while in `Superposition`. It iterates through all `VerificationCondition`s, checks if `proven` is true. The *first* condition (based on iteration order or ID order - let's use ID order for determinism) found to be proven determines the `collapsedConfigId`. Vault state changes to `Collapsed`. Subsequent calls revert. If *no* conditions are proven, it *could* revert, or transition to a default state, or revert after a timeout. Let's make it require at least one proven condition to collapse.
9.  `claimUnlockedAssetsERC20(address token)`: Users call this after state is `Collapsed`. Calculates user's claimable amount for `token` based on the `collapsedConfigId` and their initial deposits. Transfers the calculated amount, minus fee. Marks amount as claimed for the user.
10. `claimUnlockedAssetsERC721(address collection, uint256[] calldata tokenIds)`: Users call this after state is `Collapsed`. Checks if `tokenIds` are claimable by the user based on the `collapsedConfigId` and their initial deposits. Transfers the NFTs, minus potential NFT-based fee (less common, maybe just value-based fee on ERC20 part, or skip NFT fees). Let's skip NFT fees for simplicity. Marks token IDs as claimed for the user.
11. `pause()`: Owner pauses the contract. Most interactions disabled.
12. `unpause()`: Owner unpauses the contract.
13. `withdrawProtocolFeesERC20(address token)`: Owner withdraws accumulated ERC-20 fees for a specific token.
14. `withdrawProtocolFeesERC721(address collection)`: Owner withdraws accumulated ERC-721 fees for a specific collection (if any are collected, maybe from NFT sales facilitated by vault?). Let's assume fees are only in ERC20 for simplicity. Remove this function or make it revert. Let's remove this and keep fees ERC20 only.
15. `getVaultState()`: Getter for the current `VaultState`.
16. `getReleaseConfig(uint256 configId)`: Getter for details of a `ReleaseConfig`.
17. `getVerificationCondition(uint256 conditionId)`: Getter for details of a `VerificationCondition`.
18. `getUserVaultState(address user)`: Getter for a user's deposit records and claimed amounts.
19. `getERC20VaultBalance(address token)`: Getter for the contract's balance of an ERC-20 token.
20. `getERC721VaultTokens(address collection)`: Getter for the list of NFT token IDs held by the contract for a collection.
21. `getConditionStatus(uint256 conditionId)`: Getter to check if a condition is proven.
22. `getCollapsedConfigId()`: Getter for the ID of the chosen config after collapse.
23. `getProtocolFeeBasisPoints()`: Getter for the current fee rate.
24. `getProtocolFeeBalanceERC20(address token)`: Getter for the fee balance of an ERC-20 token.
25. `getUserClaimableERC20(address user, address token)`: Calculates the amount of `token` user can claim.
26. `getUserClaimableERC721(address user, address collection)`: Calculates the list of NFT IDs user can claim for `collection`.
27. `getAllConditionIds()`: Getter for all configured condition IDs.
28. `getAllConfigIds()`: Getter for all configured release config IDs.

That's 28 functions (including some getters needed for transparency), well over the 20 requirement.

Let's refine the `ReleaseConfig` and Claiming logic slightly to make it implementable:
*   `ReleaseConfig` will define distributions as `(recipientAddress, tokenAddress, amount)` or `(recipientAddress, nftCollection, tokenId)`. The *sum* of amounts/NFTs across *all* entries in a `ReleaseConfig` for a given token/collection must equal the *total* amount/NFTs of that type deposited into the vault. This makes it a full redistribution plan.
*   Claiming: User `claimUnlockedAssetsERC20(address token)` checks if *they* are a recipient for `token` in the `collapsedConfigId` and how much they are allocated. Transfers *that specific amount*.
*   Initial user deposits: Still track them, but primarily for linking *who* deposited what originally, maybe for a scenario where the config redistributes back proportionally to initial depositors (a variation of the main config idea). Let's stick to the "Config defines absolute distribution to *specific addresses*" for clarity in this example. The "quantum" part is the uncertainty *which* distribution plan is enacted. Initial deposits just fund the pool that gets distributed. Users claim if their address is in the recipient list of the winning config.

New Claiming Logic:
*   `claimUnlockedAssetsERC20(address token)`: Checks if `msg.sender` is a recipient for `token` in the `collapsedConfigId`. If yes, transfer their *allocated amount* (from the config struct) minus fees, if not already claimed.
*   `claimUnlockedAssetsERC721(address collection)`: Checks which tokenIds in `collection` `msg.sender` is a recipient for in the `collapsedConfigId`. Transfers *those specific tokenIds* if not already claimed.

This requires storing claimed status *per recipient/asset in the chosen config*.

Okay, let's implement this refined version.

    // The Pausable contract from OpenZeppelin already includes _paused and _notPaused modifiers,
    // as well as a paused() getter. We've added a custom VaultState enum and manual state management
    // alongside Pausable to handle our specific 'Superposition'/'Collapsed' states.
    // The `whenState(VaultState.Paused)` and `whenNotPaused` are used appropriately.
    // Note: pausing sets the internal `_paused` flag. Our `currentVaultState` tracks our custom states.
    // `getVaultState()` needs to check `paused()` first.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**

1.  **Complexity:** This contract is complex due to managing multiple asset types, multiple potential configurations, conditions, states, and claiming logic. This increases the surface area for bugs.
2.  **Gas Costs:** Iterating through `_conditionIds` in `triggerStateCollapse` is a potential gas bottleneck if there are a very large number of conditions. Managing arrays in storage (`_configIds`, `_conditionIds`) also adds gas cost.
3.  **Mapping Iteration:** Solidity doesn't easily allow iterating over mapping keys. Getters like `getReleaseConfigERC20Allocations` or `getERC721VaultTokens` are difficult to implement efficiently or completely without additional state variables to track mapping keys or external indexing. The provided getters are placeholders or require external knowledge/iteration.
4.  **ReleaseConfig Definition:** The chosen method where `ReleaseConfig` defines absolute allocations to specific addresses means the owner must pre-calculate or adjust these allocations based on expected or final total deposits. A proportional distribution method based on user deposits would be another approach but adds complexity to the `ReleaseConfig` structure and claim calculation.
5.  **ERC721 Fees:** Fees are only applied to ERC-20 withdrawals. Applying fees to NFTs is less standard and would require valuing the NFT or collecting a fee in a different token.
6.  **Error Handling/Edge Cases:** Robust error handling for all possible edge cases (e.g., zero address, re-entrancy beyond basic checks, token decimals for ERC20 claims, malicious proofData for non-hash types if added) requires thorough testing.
7.  **ZK Proof Verification:** The `ZKProofHash` condition *only* verifies a hash match. A real ZK-proof integration would require an on-chain verifier contract (like those generated by zk-SNARK/STARK tooling), adding significant complexity and gas cost. This implementation is a simplified *representation* of such a condition.
8.  **Non-Duplication:** While core concepts like multi-sig or time locks are common, the specific combination of a multi-asset vault with conditional outcomes determined by proving different *types* of external/verifiable conditions (including a mock ZK-hash verification) and the 'state collapse' mechanism is a creative application of these ideas that is unlikely to be a direct copy of a widely open-sourced contract.
9.  **Auditing:** This is an advanced concept and would *require* rigorous security audits before any use in a production environment with real assets.

This contract provides a framework for an interesting, advanced vault mechanism that goes beyond standard patterns by introducing conditional outcome determination based on external verifiable facts, wrapped in a "quantum state" metaphor.
