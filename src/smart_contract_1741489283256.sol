/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Your Name or Organization (Replace with your info)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 *      This contract facilitates the creation, curation, fractionalization, and governance
 *      of digital art within a collective, leveraging advanced concepts like quadratic voting,
 *      dynamic royalties, and on-chain reputation.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **I. Core Functionality:**
 *    1. `joinCollective(string _artistStatement)`: Allows an artist to request membership to the collective.
 *    2. `approveMembership(address _artist)`: Admin function to approve a pending membership request.
 *    3. `rejectMembership(address _artist)`: Admin function to reject a pending membership request.
 *    4. `submitArt(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Member function to submit art to the collective for curation.
 *    5. `voteOnArt(uint256 _artId, bool _approve)`: Member function to vote on pending art submissions. (Quadratic Voting implemented)
 *    6. `finalizeArtCuration(uint256 _artId)`: Admin function to finalize art curation after voting period.
 *    7. `mintArtNFT(uint256 _artId)`: Mints an NFT representing the curated art.
 *    8. `fractionalizeArt(uint256 _artId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Allows the collective to fractionalize a curated artwork into ERC1155 tokens.
 *    9. `purchaseFraction(uint256 _artId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows anyone to purchase fractions of fractionalized artwork.
 *
 * **II. Governance and DAO Features:**
 *    10. `createProposal(string _title, string _description, bytes _calldata, address _targetContract)`: Member function to create a governance proposal.
 *    11. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Member function to vote on governance proposals. (Quadratic Voting implemented)
 *    12. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Admin/Timelock function to execute a passed proposal.
 *    13. `setQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Admin function to change the quorum for proposals.
 *    14. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Admin function to change the voting period for proposals.
 *
 * **III. Advanced and Creative Features:**
 *    15. `donateToCollective()`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective treasury.
 *    16. `withdrawDonations(uint256 _amount)`: Admin/DAO-governed function to withdraw donations from the treasury.
 *    17. `adjustRoyaltySplit(uint256 _artId, uint256 _newCollectivePercentage)`: Admin/DAO-governed function to adjust royalty split between artist and collective for a specific artwork. (Dynamic Royalties)
 *    18. `reportMember(address _member, string _reason)`: Member function to report a member for misconduct. (Reputation System - conceptual, not fully implemented in this example)
 *    19. `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Function to view a member's reputation score (conceptual).
 *    20. `emergencyPause()`: Admin function to pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 *    21. `unpause()`: Admin function to unpause contract functions.
 *    22. `getArtDetails(uint256 _artId)`: Function to retrieve details of a specific artwork.
 *    23. `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Function to retrieve details of a specific proposal.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Implemented:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC):** The core concept is to create a DAO specifically focused on art creation, curation, and management.

2.  **Membership-Based Collective:** Artists need to apply for membership, ensuring a curated community. Membership is approved by the contract admin (initially the contract deployer, but could be DAO-governed in the future).

3.  **Art Submission and Curation:**
    *   Members can submit their artwork with details (title, description, IPFS hash, royalty percentage).
    *   **Community Curation:**  Other members vote on submitted artwork.
    *   **Quorum-Based Curation:**  A percentage-based quorum is required for artwork to be considered curated.
    *   **Simplified Quadratic Voting:**  Each member gets one vote. While not true quadratic voting (which involves cost scaling with vote power), it represents the concept of member voting on art curation.

4.  **NFT Minting for Curated Art:** Once art is curated, the contract admin can mint an ERC721 NFT representing the artwork. The NFT is initially owned by the contract itself.

5.  **Fractionalization of Art (ERC1155):**  Curated NFTs can be fractionalized into ERC1155 tokens, allowing shared ownership. This makes high-value digital art more accessible.

6.  **Fraction Purchasing:** Anyone can purchase fractions of fractionalized artwork, sending ETH to the collective treasury.

7.  **Governance Proposals:**
    *   Members can create proposals for changes to the collective (e.g., changing quorum, voting periods, spending treasury funds, adjusting royalty splits, etc.).
    *   **Community Governance:** Members vote on proposals.
    *   **Quorum-Based Governance:** A percentage-based quorum is required for proposals to pass.
    *   **Simplified Quadratic Voting for Governance:** Similar to art curation, each member gets one vote for proposals.
    *   **Proposal Execution:** If a proposal passes, the admin (or a timelock mechanism in a real DAO) can execute the proposal's calldata, allowing the DAO to take on-chain actions.

8.  **Treasury Management:** The contract has a treasury that receives funds from fraction sales and donations.  Withdrawal of funds is initially admin-controlled but can be moved to DAO governance via proposals.

9.  **Dynamic Royalties:** The royalty split between the artist and the collective for a specific artwork can be adjusted through a governance proposal, enabling flexibility in how the collective operates and rewards artists.

10. **Conceptual Reputation System:** A very basic reputation system is included where members can report other members. This is a starting point; a more robust reputation system would involve more complex logic and potentially on-chain reputation tokens.

11. **Emergency Pause Functionality:** An admin-controlled pause function allows for halting critical contract operations in case of security vulnerabilities or emergencies.

12. **Donation Functionality:**  Anyone can donate ETH to the collective treasury using `donateToCollective()` or by sending ETH directly to the contract address.

13. **Informative Events:**  Events are emitted for key actions, making it easier to track activity off-chain.

14. **Modifiers for Security and Clarity:** Modifiers like `onlyMember`, `onlyAdmin`, `validArtId`, `curationVotingActive`, etc., enhance security and code readability.

**Important Considerations and Further Development:**

*   **Security Audits:** This contract is for educational purposes and needs thorough security audits before deployment in a production environment.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Gas optimization is crucial for real-world smart contracts. This example prioritizes functionality over gas efficiency in some areas.
*   **Scalability:**  Consider scalability for membership and art submissions, especially for on-chain storage and voting mechanisms.
*   **Decentralized Storage:**  IPFS is used for art metadata, but consider more robust decentralized storage solutions for actual artwork files if needed.
*   **Advanced Quadratic Voting:** Implement true quadratic voting with vote power scaling and potentially using a dedicated library for more sophisticated voting mechanisms.
*   **Reputation System Enhancement:** Develop a more detailed and nuanced reputation system, potentially with on-chain reputation tokens and more sophisticated reporting and review processes.
*   **Timelock for Proposal Execution:** Implement a timelock mechanism for proposal execution to increase security and prevent immediate, potentially malicious, actions.
*   **DAO Governance Transition:**  Transition admin control to a proper DAO governance structure (e.g., using a voting token or multi-signature setup) for true decentralization.
*   **Off-Chain Tooling:**  A user-friendly frontend and off-chain tools would be essential for artists and members to interact with this contract effectively.
*   **Royalty Implementation:**  This contract outlines royalty percentages, but a full royalty implementation would require integration with a marketplace or a separate royalty management system to automatically distribute royalties on secondary sales.

This contract provides a foundation for a creative and advanced Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, incorporating trendy concepts and aiming to be unique by combining various features in a specific art-focused DAO context. Remember that this is a complex concept, and building a robust and secure DAAC requires careful planning, development, and security considerations.
