Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract combining concepts like multi-asset management, timed and conditional access grants, and basic role-based access control, aimed at being relatively advanced and creative without directly duplicating standard open-source templates.

This contract represents a "Dynamic Access Vault" where users can deposit multiple ERC-20 tokens and then create conditional grants that allow *other* addresses to claim a portion of their deposited assets if specific time-based and/or manual conditions are met.

/**
 * @title DynamicAccessVault

 * create conditional access grants for others to claim locked assets based on time and manual flags.

// --- OUTLINE ---
// 1. State Variables: Core vault state, user balances, grant data, roles.
// 2. Events: Logging key actions like deposits, withdrawals, grant creation/claims, etc.
// 3. Modifiers: Access control (owner, pausable, condition controller), reentrancy guard.
// 4. Structs: Definition for the Conditional Access Grant.
// 5. Core Vault Logic: Deposit, withdrawal, supported tokens management, balance queries.
// 6. Conditional Access Grant Logic: Creation, cancellation, claiming, condition checking/setting.
// 7. Access Control & Utility: Ownership transfer, pausing, role management, emergency withdrawal.

// --- FUNCTION SUMMARY ---
// --- Core Vault Functions ---
// - constructor(address[] initialSupportedTokens_): Initializes the contract with owner and supported tokens.
// - deposit(address token, uint256 amount): Allows users to deposit supported ERC20 tokens into their balance.
// - withdraw(address token, uint256 amount): Allows users to withdraw their available balance of a supported token.
// - addSupportedToken(address token): Owner adds a new token to the list of supported tokens.
// - removeSupportedToken(address token): Owner removes a token (prevents *new* deposits).
// - getUserBalance(address user, address token): View the total deposited balance of a user for a token.
// - getAvailableUserBalance(address user, address token): View the user's balance minus locked amounts in grants.
// - getTotalVaultBalance(address token): View the total balance of a specific token held in the vault across all users.
// - isSupportedToken(address token): Check if a token is supported.

// --- Conditional Access Grant Functions ---
// - createConditionalAccessGrant(address recipient, address token, uint256 amount, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, bool requiresManualCondition_): Creates a grant, locking the specified amount from the grantor's available balance.
// - cancelGrant(uint256 grantId): Allows the grantor to cancel an unclaimed and unexpired grant, returning locked funds.
// - claimGrant(uint256 grantId): Allows the recipient to claim the grant if all conditions are met.
// - setGrantManualCondition(uint256 grantId, bool met): Allows the condition controller to set the manual condition flag for a grant.
// - getGrantDetails(uint256 grantId): View details of a specific grant.
// - getGrantStatus(uint256 grantId): View the current status (e.g., Active, Claimed, Expired, Pending Conditions) of a grant.
// - checkGrantConditionsMet(uint256 grantId): View function to check if all conditions for a grant are currently true.
// - getUserLockedBalance(address user, address token): View the total amount of a token locked by a user in active grants.
// - getTotalLockedSupply(address token): View the total amount of a token locked in all active grants across the vault.
// - getNextGrantId(): View the ID that will be assigned to the next grant.

// --- Access Control & Utility Functions ---
// - pause(): Owner pauses the contract (disables most actions).
// - unpause(): Owner unpauses the contract.
// - setConditionController(address controller): Owner sets the address allowed to set manual conditions.
// - getConditionController(): View the current condition controller address.
// - revokeConditionController(): Owner revokes the condition controller role.
// - ownerWithdrawUnsupportedERC20(address token, uint256 amount): Owner can withdraw accidentally sent *unsupported* ERC20 tokens.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vaulting:** The contract can hold and manage balances for multiple distinct ERC-20 tokens simultaneously, tracked per user (`_userBalances`) and globally (`_totalVaultBalances`).
2.  **Conditional Access Grants (CAGs):** This is the core novel concept. It's not a simple token transfer or escrow.
    *   **Permissionless Granting:** Any user with a balance in the vault can create a grant *from their own balance* without needing central approval.
    *   **Conditional Release:** Assets are locked and only claimable by the recipient if predefined conditions are met:
        *   **Time-Based:** Requires the current time to be between a `startTime` and `endTime`.
        *   **Manual Flag:** An optional boolean flag (`requiresManualCondition`) that must be set to `true` by a designated `conditionController`. This allows for off-chain events or human discretion to be a part of the release criteria in a semi-decentralized way.
    *   **On-Chain Status Tracking:** The `getGrantStatus` function provides a human-readable interpretation of the grant's current state based on its internal variables and the current time/manual flag state.
    *   **Grantor Control:** The original grantor can `cancelGrant` under certain conditions (if not claimed and not expired), reclaiming their locked funds.
3.  **Separation of Balances:** The contract explicitly tracks `_userBalances` (total deposited) and `_userLockedBalances` (part of the total locked in grants). Withdrawals are restricted to the `availableBalance` (`_userBalances - _userLockedBalances`), which is a common pattern in staking or locking contracts but applied here to dynamic grants.
4.  **Role-Based Access Control (Partial):** Beyond the standard `Ownable` pattern, a specific `conditionController` role is introduced with a single, powerful permission (`setGrantManualCondition`). This shows a simple form of breaking down admin privileges.
5.  **Dynamic Supported Tokens:** The owner can add or remove supported tokens dynamically.
6.  **Gas Considerations & Data Structures:** While attempting to provide view functions for listing grants per user/token (`userGrantsAsGrantor`, `userGrantsAsRecipient`, `tokenGrants`), the code includes a note acknowledging that returning large arrays on-chain is gas-intensive. In a production system handling many grants, off-chain indexing would typically be used for these lists. The choice to include them here is partly to meet the function count requirement and demonstrate the tracking structure, while being mindful of practical limitations. The addition of `_totalLockedSupply` state variable improves the efficiency of the `getTotalLockedSupply` view function compared to iterating through grants.

This contract provides a foundation for use cases like decentralized vesting with manual overrides, conditional prize distribution, time-locked gifts or inheritance-like patterns triggered by external (attested off-chain) conditions, all within a multi-asset environment.
