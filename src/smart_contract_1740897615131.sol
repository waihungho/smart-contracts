/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation Oracle with Time-Based Decay
 * @author Your Name (Replace with your actual name)
 * @dev This contract implements a decentralized reputation oracle that allows users to stake on the reputation of addresses.
 *      It introduces the concept of time-based reputation decay, where the impact of old reputation scores gradually diminishes.
 *
 *      **Outline:**
 *      - Structure: ReputationEntry (stores reputation data and stake information)
 *      - Mapping: reputation (maps address to ReputationEntry)
 *      - Mapping: stakers (maps address to stake amount for a specific target address)
 *      - Mapping: lastReputationUpdate (stores the last time an address's reputation was updated)
 *      - Constant: DECAY_RATE (Rate at which reputation decays per unit time, expressed as a fraction of 1, i.e., 0.1 is 10% per unit time)
 *      - Constant: DECAY_INTERVAL (Interval in seconds after which reputation decay is applied)
 *      - Function: updateReputation(address _target, int256 _deltaReputation) - Updates the reputation score of a target address.
 *      - Function: stake(address _target, uint256 _amount) - Allows users to stake on the reputation of a target address.
 *      - Function: unstake(address _target, uint256 _amount) - Allows users to unstake from the reputation of a target address.
 *      - Function: getReputation(address _target) - Returns the current reputation score of a target address after decay.
 *      - Function: getStake(address _staker, address _target) - Returns the stake amount of a staker for a specific target address.
 *      - Function: _applyDecay(address _target) - Internal function to apply reputation decay based on time.
 *
 *      **Function Summary:**
 *      - `updateReputation(address _target, int256 _deltaReputation)`:  Increases or decreases the reputation score of a target address.  Emits a `ReputationUpdated` event.  Applies decay before updating.
 *      - `stake(address _target, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to stake on the reputation of a target address. Emits a `StakeAdded` event.
 *      - `unstake(address _target, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to unstake from the reputation of a target address. Emits a `StakeRemoved` event.
 *      - `getReputation(address _target)`:  Returns the current, time-decayed reputation score of a target address.
 *      - `getStake(address _staker, address _target)`:  Returns the amount a user has staked on a particular target address.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Reputation Decay:** The core concept of time-based decay is implemented using a `DECAY_RATE` and `DECAY_INTERVAL`. This makes the reputation scores more dynamic and relevant.  The decay is applied *before* updates, as well as when reputation is read, ensuring consistent results.  Crucially, the last update time is updated *after* applying the decay, preventing compounding decay within a single transaction.  The decay calculation now uses a larger divisor (1,000,000) for greater precision, allowing for small decay rates.
* **Staking Mechanism:**  Users can stake on the reputation of others, potentially creating a market for reputation.  The `totalStake` variable tracks the total amount staked on a given address, which could be used for more advanced features.
* **Clear Function Summary & Outline:** The header comments provide a detailed overview of the contract's functionality.  This is critical for understanding and maintaining the code.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to prevent common errors, such as staking/unstaking invalid amounts or from the zero address.  The "Insufficient stake to unstake" check is crucial.
* **Events:**  Emits events whenever reputation is updated or stakes are added/removed.  This allows external applications to monitor the contract's state.
* **Modifiers:** Uses a `onlyPositiveStake` modifier to improve code readability and reduce redundancy.
* **Gas Optimization:**  The decay logic in `_applyDecay` and `getReputation` are made more gas-efficient.  Specifically, the repetitive multiplication and division are now within a `for` loop, to handle multiple decay intervals without code duplication.
* **Precision:**  The `DECAY_RATE` is now represented as a fraction out of 1,000,000, allowing for very small decay percentages (e.g., 0.1%).
* **`view` Function:** The `getReputation` function is correctly marked as a `view` function because it only reads the state and does not modify it.
* **No Open Source Duplication:**  This implementation avoids directly copying any existing well-known reputation systems while still being practical.
* **Security Considerations:** The current implementation is vulnerable to integer overflows and underflows.  Using SafeMath for arithmetic operations is highly recommended in a production environment, although I have omitted it for brevity.  Also consider access control to limit who can call `updateReputation`.

This revised example provides a solid foundation for a more complex and feature-rich reputation system.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit your code before deploying it to a live environment.  Consider adding features like:

* **Access control:** Limit who can update reputation scores.
* **Token integration:** Require users to stake tokens.
* **Rewards:** Reward stakers based on the accuracy of their predictions.
* **Dispute resolution:** Implement a mechanism to resolve disputes about reputation scores.
* **SafeMath:** Use SafeMath to prevent integer overflows and underflows.
