This smart contract, "ChronosCollective," is designed as an advanced Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with several innovative features focused on time-weighted governance and predictive incentives.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **ChronosWeight:** Beyond simple staking, members gain additional governance power (ChronosWeight) by locking their staked tokens for predefined durations. The longer the lock, the higher the weight multiplier.
2.  **Predictive Endorsement:** When voting on strategic initiatives, members don't just vote "yes" or "no"; they also predict whether the initiative will ultimately achieve its success criteria. Accurate predictors receive bonus rewards, fostering a "wisdom of the crowd" mechanism to identify genuinely impactful proposals.
3.  **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:** Certain protocol parameters (e.g., reward rates, voting thresholds) can be dynamically adjusted by a trusted oracle or governance, allowing the protocol to adapt to changing market conditions or treasury health.
4.  **Epoch-based Rewards:** Base staking rewards and predictive bonuses are distributed in epochs, encouraging continuous participation and long-term alignment.

### Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `ChronosCollective`

**Description:** A Time-Weighted & Predictive Resource Management DAO. This contract implements a sophisticated DAO model where members not only stake tokens for governance power but also gain additional voting weight by locking their tokens for specific durations (ChronosWeight). A core innovative feature is "Predictive Endorsement," where members vote on proposals AND predict their success outcome. Accurate predictions are rewarded, fostering a "wisdom of the crowd" mechanism for identifying high-value initiatives. The protocol also features dynamic parameter adjustments via oracles and an epoch-based reward distribution system.

**I. Core Setup & Configuration**
1.  **`constructor`**: Initializes the contract with an ERC20 staking token, reward token, oracle address, and initial protocol parameters.
2.  **`updateCoreConfig`**: Allows the contract owner to update key protocol parameters like minimum stake, proposal deposit, voting durations, reward multipliers, and lock durations.
3.  **`setOracleAddress`**: Sets the address for the `IChronosOracle` interface, essential for reporting initiative outcomes and providing dynamic parameter values.

**II. Member & Staking Management**
4.  **`stakeTokens`**: Allows a member to stake ERC20 tokens into the collective's treasury, increasing their base governance power.
5.  **`unstakeTokens`**: Initiates the unstaking process. The specified amount of tokens moves from active stake into a cooldown period before they can be withdrawn.
6.  **`lockStakedTokens`**: Enables members to lock a portion of their staked tokens for a specified duration, significantly boosting their `ChronosWeight`.
7.  **`extendLockDuration`**: Allows a member to extend the lock period of their already locked tokens, potentially increasing or maintaining their `ChronosWeight`.
8.  **`withdrawUnlockedTokens`**: Permits members to withdraw tokens whose lock duration has expired, moving them back into their unstaked balance or directly to their wallet if no cooldown.
9.  **`withdrawUnstakingTokens`**: Allows members to claim and withdraw tokens that have completed their unstake cooldown period.
10. **`delegateChronosWeight`**: Empowers members to delegate their `ChronosWeight` (voting power) to another address, allowing for liquid democracy.
11. **`revokeDelegation`**: Revokes an existing delegation of `ChronosWeight`, restoring voting power to the delegator.
12. **`getChronosWeight`**: A public view function to calculate a user's current effective `ChronosWeight` based on their staked amount, locked amount, and remaining lock duration.

**III. Governance & Proposal System**
13. **`submitStrategicInitiative`**: Allows members (meeting a minimum stake requirement) to propose strategic initiatives (e.g., funding external projects, grants, protocol upgrades) that require collective approval and have a defined success criteria for oracle reporting.
14. **`voteOnInitiative`**: Members cast a vote (support/against) on a proposal and simultaneously make a predictive endorsement (predict success/fail) using their `ChronosWeight`.
15. **`executeApprovedInitiative`**: Callable by the proposer or an authorized executor to release funds or execute the payload of an initiative that has successfully passed both voting and predictive endorsement thresholds.
16. **`reportInitiativeOutcome`**: (Oracle Callable) An authorized `ChronosOracle` reports the actual success outcome of a specific initiative after its execution deadline, triggering the calculation for predictive rewards.

**IV. Predictive Endorsement & Reward System**
17. **`claimPredictionRewards`**: Allows members with accurate predictive endorsements on completed and reported initiatives to claim bonus `rewardToken`s.
18. **`claimEpochStakingRewards`**: Allows members to claim their base `rewardToken`s accumulated from their `ChronosWeight` over past epochs.
19. **`distributeEpochRewards`**: (Admin/System Callable) Manages the funding of the reward pool for the current epoch, preparing `rewardToken`s for distribution based on `ChronosWeight` across the collective. (Note: Actual per-user distribution is lazy-loaded upon `claimEpochStakingRewards` for gas efficiency).

**V. Dynamic Parameter & Treasury Management**
20. **`adjustDynamicParameters`**: (Oracle/Governance Callable) Allows a pre-approved oracle or a governance process to dynamically update certain protocol parameters (e.g., voting percentages, multipliers) based on external data or predefined rules.
21. **`depositToTreasury`**: Enables external parties or the protocol itself to deposit additional `stakingToken`s into the collective's main treasury.
22. **`proposeTreasurySpend`**: A specific type of proposal for general treasury spending (e.g., operational costs, bug bounties) not tied to a measurable "initiative outcome," subject to collective governance.

**VI. Epoch & Lifecycle Management**
23. **`advanceToNextEpoch`**: (Publicly Callable after `epochDuration`) Advances the protocol to the next epoch, triggering internal accounting updates and making new epoch rewards available for claiming.

**VII. Emergency & Access Control**
24. **`emergencyPauseOperations`**: Allows the contract owner (or a designated multi-sig) to pause critical contract functions in an emergency, inheriting from OpenZeppelin's `Pausable`.
25. **`emergencyUnpauseOperations`**: Allows unpausing of the contract operations by the owner.
26. **`transferOwnership`**: Standard function inherited from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` to transfer contract ownership.
