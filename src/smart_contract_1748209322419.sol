Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract for a "Dynamic NFT Marketplace". This contract introduces concepts like:

1.  **Dynamic NFTs:** NFTs whose state (represented by a simple 'level' or 'status' in this example) can change based on actions taken within the marketplace, specifically by completing time-based "missions".
2.  **Integrated Missions:** The marketplace isn't just for buying/selling; it's a platform where NFT holders can "activate" their NFTs to participate in predefined missions, triggering state changes upon completion.
3.  **Royalty Distribution:** Built-in mechanism to collect and allow creators to claim royalties from secondary sales.
4.  **Admin Control:** The contract owner can approve specific NFT collections, set fees, and define missions.

It aims to combine marketplace features with a gamified, state-changing element for NFTs, providing more utility than just ownership.

**Contract Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `DynamicNFTMarketplace`

**Core Concept:** A marketplace for buying and selling ERC721 NFTs, enhanced with a feature allowing NFT owners to "activate" their NFTs for predefined "missions" that can change the NFT's internal state (e.g., level up) after a set duration. Includes royalty distribution and administrative controls.

**Structs:**

1.  `Listing`: Represents an item listed for sale (NFT details, seller, price, active status).
2.  `Mission`: Defines a mission (duration, required state, state changes on completion).
3.  `ActiveMission`: Tracks an NFT currently participating in a mission (mission ID, start time).
4.  `NFTState`: Represents the dynamic state of an NFT within the marketplace context (e.g., level, status).

**State Variables:**

*   `owner`: Contract administrator address.
*   `feeRecipient`: Address receiving marketplace fees.
*   `feePercentage`: Percentage fee on sales (basis points).
*   `listings`: Mapping from listing ID to `Listing` struct.
*   `listingCount`: Counter for generating unique listing IDs.
*   `approvedCollections`: Mapping of ERC721 addresses to boolean (is approved?).
*   `nftStates`: Mapping from NFT collection address and token ID to `NFTState` struct.
*   `missions`: Mapping from mission ID to `Mission` struct.
*   `missionCount`: Counter for generating unique mission IDs.
*   `activeMissions`: Mapping from NFT collection address and token ID to `ActiveMission` struct.
*   `collectionRoyalties`: Mapping from NFT collection address to royalty percentage (basis points).
*   `accruedRoyalties`: Mapping from creator address to accumulated royalty amount.

**Events:**

*   `ItemListed(uint256 listingId, address indexed seller, address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 price)`: Emitted when an item is listed.
*   `ItemBought(uint256 listingId, address indexed buyer, address indexed seller, address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 price, uint256 fee, uint256 royaltyAmount)`: Emitted when an item is bought.
*   `ListingCancelled(uint256 indexed listingId)`: Emitted when a listing is cancelled.
*   `CollectionApproved(address indexed nftCollection)`: Emitted when an NFT collection is approved.
*   `CollectionDisapproved(address indexed nftCollection)`: Emitted when an NFT collection is disapproved.
*   `FeeUpdated(uint256 newFeePercentage)`: Emitted when the fee percentage is updated.
*   `FeeRecipientUpdated(address indexed newRecipient)`: Emitted when the fee recipient is updated.
*   `MissionCreated(uint256 indexed missionId, uint256 duration, uint256 requiredLevel, uint256 levelChange)`: Emitted when a mission is created.
*   `MissionUpdated(uint256 indexed missionId, uint256 duration, uint256 requiredLevel, uint256 levelChange)`: Emitted when a mission is updated.
*   `NFTActivatedForMission(address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 indexed missionId, uint64 startTime)`: Emitted when an NFT starts a mission.
*   `NFTDeactivatedFromMission(address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 indexed missionId)`: Emitted when an NFT is deactivated from a mission before completion.
*   `MissionCompleted(address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 indexed missionId, uint256 newLevel)`: Emitted when an NFT successfully completes a mission.
*   `NFTStateChanged(address indexed nftCollection, uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 oldLevel, uint256 newLevel)`: Emitted when an NFT's state (level) changes.
*   `CreatorRoyaltySet(address indexed nftCollection, uint256 royaltyPercentage)`: Emitted when a creator royalty is set for a collection.
*   `RoyaltiesClaimed(address indexed creator, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when a creator claims royalties.

**Functions (Total: 26+)**

1.  `constructor(address _feeRecipient, uint256 _initialFeePercentage)`: Initializes the contract owner, fee recipient, and initial fee percentage. (`onlyOwner`)
2.  `updateFeeRecipient(address _newRecipient)`: Updates the address that receives marketplace fees. (`onlyOwner`)
3.  `updateFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Updates the fee percentage for sales (in basis points, max 10000). (`onlyOwner`)
4.  `approveNFTCollection(address _nftCollection)`: Approves an ERC721 contract address, allowing NFTs from this collection to be listed and used in missions. (`onlyOwner`)
5.  `disapproveNFTCollection(address _nftCollection)`: Disapproves an ERC721 contract address. Prevents new listings/activations from this collection. (`onlyOwner`)
6.  `createMission(uint256 _durationSeconds, uint256 _requiredLevel, int256 _levelChangeOnCompletion)`: Creates a new mission type. (`onlyOwner`)
7.  `updateMission(uint256 _missionId, uint256 _durationSeconds, uint256 _requiredLevel, int256 _levelChangeOnCompletion)`: Updates an existing mission definition. (`onlyOwner`)
8.  `withdrawFees()`: Allows the contract owner/fee recipient to withdraw accumulated fees. (`onlyOwner`)
9.  `listItem(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: Lists an NFT for sale. Requires the seller to have approved the marketplace contract to transfer the NFT. Checks if the collection is approved.
10. `buyItem(uint256 _listingId)`: Purchases a listed NFT. Transfers payment, handles fees and royalties, and transfers the NFT. Requires sending exact listing price + fee. (`payable`)
11. `cancelListing(uint256 _listingId)`: Cancels an active listing. Only the seller can cancel. Transfers the NFT back to the seller.
12. `activateNFTForMission(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _missionId)`: Starts a mission for a specific NFT. Checks NFT state against mission requirements and if the NFT is already active. Requires the owner to have approved the marketplace contract to transfer the NFT (optional, depending on implementation, here we assume transfer to contract during activation). *Self-correction: Transferring might be too restrictive. Let's design it such that the marketplace just needs approval to *check* state and *call* functions on the NFT contract if needed, but the NFT stays in the owner's wallet. Or, the owner *approves* the marketplace and the marketplace acts *on behalf of* the owner for state changes. Let's go with the approval pattern for state checks/changes, keeping the NFT in the owner's wallet unless listed for sale.* *Refinement: The NFT *must* be deposited or approved *to* the marketplace to prevent it from being transferred/sold while on a mission. Let's stick with the deposit/transfer on activation pattern for simpler state management.*
13. `deactivateNFTFromMission(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId)`: Stops an active mission for an NFT before completion. Returns the NFT to the owner.
14. `completeMission(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId)`: Attempts to complete an active mission for an NFT. Checks if the mission duration has passed. If complete, updates the NFT's state (level) and emits events. Callable by anyone to trigger the state change once time is up.
15. `setCreatorRoyalty(address _nftCollection, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Sets the royalty percentage for a specific NFT collection (in basis points, max 10000). Only callable by the *current* owner of an NFT from that collection, or a designated creator address (let's use the contract owner for simplicity, but mention this could be extended). *Correction: Setting royalties should ideally be by the original deployer/creator or a trusted party. Let's make it an `onlyOwner` function for this example.*
16. `claimCreatorRoyalties(address _nftCollection)`: Allows the designated creator address (derived from the collection, or perhaps stored mapping) to claim their accrued royalties for a specific collection. For simplicity, let's allow anyone to claim royalties for *any* collection if they are the registered creator, or modify to claim *all* accrued royalties at once. Let's make it claim *all* accrued royalties for the caller.
17. `getListing(uint256 _listingId)`: Returns details of a specific listing. (`view`)
18. `getCollectionListings(address _nftCollection)`: Returns a list of listing IDs for a specific collection. (`view`) - *Implementation detail: Storing lists is complex. Let's provide a getter for individual listings by ID and count.* *Refined: Provide individual listing getter.*
19. `getUserListings(address _seller)`: Returns a list of listing IDs for a specific seller. (`view`) - *Same implementation detail, provide individual getter.*
20. `getNFTState(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the current dynamic state (level) of an NFT. (`view`)
21. `getMissionDetails(uint256 _missionId)`: Returns details of a specific mission. (`view`)
22. `getNFTMissionStatus(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns the active mission ID and start time for an NFT, if any. (`view`)
23. `getNFTActiveMissionEndTime(address _nftCollection, uint256 _tokenId)`: Calculates and returns the expected end time for an NFT's active mission. Returns 0 if no active mission. (`view`)
24. `getApprovedCollections()`: Returns an array of approved collection addresses. (`view`) - *Implementation detail: Storing arrays is complex. Let's provide a check for a single collection.* *Refined: `isCollectionApproved(address _nftCollection)`.*
25. `isCollectionApproved(address _nftCollection)`: Checks if an NFT collection is approved. (`view`)
26. `getAccruedRoyalties(address _creator)`: Returns the total accrued royalties for a creator address. (`view`)

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic NFT State (`NFTState`, `nftStates`, `_updateNFTState` logic in `completeMission`):** Instead of NFTs being static jpegs or fixed items, their `level` can change based on interaction with the marketplace contract. This `level` (or other stats you might add) could then be used by external platforms (like games or frontends) to display different metadata, unlock features, or grant benefits, making the NFT dynamic.
2.  **On-Chain Missions (`Mission`, `ActiveMission`, `activateNFTForMission`, `deactivateNFTFromMission`, `completeMission`, `withdrawCompletedNFT`):** The contract provides a built-in utility for approved NFTs. Owners can engage their NFTs in time-based activities. This locks the NFT (`activateNFTForMission` transfers it to the contract) for a duration. After the time (`completeMission`), the NFT state changes. This is a simple form of gamification or utility-bearing mechanics integrated directly into the marketplace contract, not just an external dapp interacting with standard NFTs.
3.  **ERC721Holder Integration:** By inheriting `ERC721Holder` and implementing `onERC721Received`, the contract is designed to safely receive and hold ERC721 tokens, which is necessary for listing items and locking NFTs during missions.
4.  **Integrated Royalty Distribution (`collectionRoyalties`, `accruedRoyalties`, `setCreatorRoyalty`, `claimCreatorRoyalties`, `setCollectionCreator`):** A direct mechanism within the marketplace to manage creator royalty percentages and allow creators to claim their share from secondary sales processed by this contract. While royalty standards exist (like EIP-2981), integrating it directly ensures collection and distribution for sales *on this marketplace*.
5.  **Modular Design:** The contract separates concerns like admin functions, marketplace logic, mission logic, and royalty handling into distinct function groups and state variables. Approved collections and definable missions make the system somewhat extensible.

**Security Considerations (Important Disclaimer):**

This contract is a complex example demonstrating features. It is *not* audited or production-ready. A real-world contract would require:

*   **Comprehensive Audits:** Professional security review is essential.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** More specific error messages, edge case handling (e.g., what if a collection address isn't a valid ERC721?), and potential reentrancy guards (though simple value transfers here mitigate some risk, more complex interactions would need `ReentrancyGuard`).
*   **Gas Optimization:** Complex state changes and loops (if added) can be expensive.
*   **Upgradeability:** For a long-term project, consider using upgradeable contract patterns (e.g., Proxies).
*   **Owner/Creator Management:** The current creator/royalty assignment is simplified. A real system might use roles, multi-sigs, or integrate with on-chain identity.
*   **Mission Complexity:** The mission logic is time-based. Real-world dynamic NFTs might use oracles for external events, Chainlink VRF for randomness, or proof-of-work/stake mechanisms. This contract provides a simplified model.

This contract fulfills the request for a complex, creative, and functions-rich example beyond basic open-source templates, incorporating dynamic state and gamified utility.
