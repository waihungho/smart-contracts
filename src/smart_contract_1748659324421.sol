Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a concept I call the "Quantum Vault". This contract goes beyond standard vaults by incorporating features like dynamic fees, multi-layered conditional unlocks, unique non-transferable identifiers (Entangled State Identifiers), temporary delegated access, and state changes influenced by on-chain entropy.

It aims to be distinct from standard open-source examples like basic timelocks, ERC20/ERC721 implementations, or simple multi-sigs.

// --- Outline ---
// 1. State Variables & Constants: Defines the core data storage, configurations, and unique identifiers.
// 2. Enums & Structs: Defines discrete states and complex data structures for locks and conditions.
// 3. Events: Logs important actions for transparency and off-chain monitoring.
// 4. Modifiers: Custom logic to restrict function access or flow based on state or conditions.
// 5. Error Handling: Custom errors for clearer reverts.
// 6. Core Logic:
//    - Constructor: Initializes the contract owner and basic parameters.
//    - Receive/Fallback: Handles direct ETH deposits.
//    - Deposit: Allows users to deposit ETH, optionally with initial lock.
//    - Withdrawals: Multiple functions for different withdrawal types (Standard, Conditional, Emergency).
//    - Locking Mechanisms: Functions to set, extend, and manage time-based and conditional locks.
//    - Entangled State Identifiers (ESI): Management functions for unique user keys.
//    - Access Delegation: Functions to temporarily delegate withdrawal rights.
//    - Configuration: Functions to adjust contract parameters (fees, penalties, durations).
//    - State Management: Functions to control the contract's overall state (Pause, Emergency).
//    - Utility & Information: View functions and helper functions (calculate fees, get info, recover tokens).
//    - Advanced Functions: Triggering conditional releases, state adjustments based on entropy, sweeping dust.

// --- Function Summary ---
// State Management:
// 1. constructor: Initializes owner, minimum lock duration, and initial fee multiplier/penalty.
// 2. pauseVault: Owner-only. Pauses core vault operations (deposit, withdraw).
// 3. unpauseVault: Owner-only. Unpauses core vault operations.
// 4. setEmergencyState: Owner-only. Puts the vault in an emergency state (potentially altering behaviors).
// 5. getVaultState: Pure/View. Returns the current state of the vault (Active, Paused, Emergency).
//
// Deposit & Withdrawals:
// 6. receive(): External/Payable. Allows direct ETH transfers to the contract.
// 7. deposit: External/Payable. Allows users to deposit ETH, optionally setting an initial timed lock.
// 8. withdraw: External. Allows user to withdraw their balance after any locks expire.
// 9. withdrawConditional: External. Allows user to withdraw if their specific on-chain condition is met AND time lock (if any) expired.
// 10. withdrawEmergency: External. Allows user to withdraw immediately with a penalty fee applied.
// 11. calculateDynamicFee: Public/View. Calculates the dynamic fee for a withdrawal based on current state and vault balance.
//
// Locking Mechanisms:
// 12. lockFundsTimed: External. Sets or extends a time-based lock on a user's balance.
// 13. lockFundsConditional: External. Sets a conditional lock based on a target block number and a flag state.
// 14. extendLockTime: External. Adds more time to an existing time-based lock.
// 15. setConditionalFlag: External. Allows owner or authorized party to set the state of a conditional flag for a specific user.
// 16. triggerConditionalReleaseCheck: External. Allows *any* address to attempt triggering a conditional release for a user if their conditions are met.
//
// Entangled State Identifiers (ESI):
// 17. generateESI: External. Generates a unique, non-transferable identifier for the caller based on on-chain entropy. Requires minimum deposit/balance? (Let's keep it simple: just generate per address).
// 18. revokeESI: Owner-only. Revokes an ESI for a specific user.
// 19. renounceESI: External. Allows a user to voluntarily renounce their own ESI.
// 20. getESI: Public/View. Returns the ESI for a given address.
//
// Access Delegation:
// 21. delegateAccess: External. Allows a user to delegate temporary withdrawal rights (up to a limit) to another address.
// 22. revokeDelegatedAccess: External. Allows a user to revoke a previously set delegation.
// 23. withdrawDelegated: External. Allows a delegated address to withdraw funds on behalf of the delegator (up to the delegated limit).
//
// Configuration:
// 24. setDynamicFeeMultiplier: Owner-only. Sets the multiplier used in dynamic fee calculation.
// 25. setEmergencyUnlockPenalty: Owner-only. Sets the percentage penalty for emergency withdrawals.
// 26. setMinimumLockDuration: Owner-only. Sets the minimum duration for any new time-based locks.
//
// Utility & Information:
// 27. getUserBalance: Public/View. Returns the locked and available balance for a user.
// 28. getUserUnlockTime: Public/View. Returns the timestamp when a user's time lock expires.
// 29. getUserCondition: Public/View. Returns the conditional lock details for a user.
// 30. recoverERC20: Owner-only. Allows recovery of accidentally sent ERC20 tokens.
// 31. sweepETH: Owner-only. Allows sweeping minor dust amounts of ETH remaining in the contract.
//
// Advanced Functions:
// 32. triggerStateShuffle: External. Uses block data entropy to potentially adjust internal state parameters slightly, influencing future interactions (e.g., fee calculation input).
// 33. isLockExpired: Internal/View. Helper to check if time lock is expired.
// 34. isConditionMet: Internal/View. Helper to check if conditional lock is met.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Multi-Layered Locking (`timeLocks`, `conditionalLocks`):** Users can have *both* a time-based lock and a conditional lock. Withdrawal requires *both* conditions to be met (`isLockExpired` AND `isConditionMet`).
2.  **Conditional Locks (`ConditionalLock` struct, `lockFundsConditional`, `setConditionalFlag`, `triggerConditionalReleaseCheck`):** Allows locking funds until a specific future block *and* a boolean flag is set to true by an authorized party (the owner in this case, could be extended). The `triggerConditionalReleaseCheck` allows *anyone* to initiate the withdrawal check for a user if their conditions are met, enabling potential external automation or event-driven releases.
3.  **Dynamic Fees (`calculateDynamicFee`, `dynamicFeeMultiplier`, `shuffledFeeInfluence`):** The fee for a standard withdrawal isn't fixed. It combines a base percentage, a component based on the total ETH balance currently in the vault (higher balance = potentially slightly higher fee contribution), and a component influenced by the `triggerStateShuffle` function. This adds a non-linear, state-dependent element to the cost of withdrawal.
4.  **Entangled State Identifiers (ESI) (`userESIs`, `esiToAddress`, `generateESI`, `revokeESI`, `renounceESI`, `onlyESIHolder` modifier):** Introduces a unique, non-transferable identifier generated for each user based on on-chain entropy at the time of generation. While not a full soulbound token standard (like ERC-5192), it acts as a unique, address-bound key within the contract. Functions *could* be restricted to `onlyESIHolder` for certain advanced operations, creating a unique identity layer (though the example doesn't heavily utilize the modifier beyond just having the ESI).
5.  **Temporary Delegated Access (`delegatedWithdrawAllowance`, `delegateAccess`, `revokeDelegatedAccess`, `withdrawDelegated`):** Allows a user to temporarily grant another address the right to withdraw a specific amount on their behalf. This delegate withdrawal *still respects the delegator's locks*. This is more complex than a simple multi-sig and provides fine-grained, revocable permission.
6.  **State Shuffle (`shuffleSeed`, `shuffledFeeInfluence`, `triggerStateShuffle`):** A function that uses block data entropy (`block.timestamp`, `block.number`, `block.difficulty`/`block.prevrandao`, `block.coinbase`, `msg.sender`) to generate a seed. This seed is then used to slightly influence other contract parameters (like the dynamic fee calculation via `shuffledFeeInfluence`). This adds a subtle, non-deterministic element to the contract's behavior, playing on the "quantum" theme of state variability based on observation/interaction (calling the function).
7.  **Emergency Withdrawal (`withdrawEmergency`, `emergencyUnlockPenalty`):** A separate withdrawal path that bypasses time and conditional locks but incurs a significant percentage penalty, usable even if the vault is paused or in an emergency state.
8.  **Structured Error Handling (`error ...`)**: Using custom errors (introduced in Solidity 0.8.4) for clearer and cheaper reverts.
9.  **Reentrancy Guard (`nonReentrant`):** Essential for any contract handling Ether transfers to prevent reentrancy attacks.

This contract demonstrates a combination of locking mechanisms, dynamic parameters influenced by state and entropy, unique identity representation, and flexible access patterns, creating a complex vault concept that goes beyond typical examples.
