/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI (Conceptual Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev
 *
 * Outline & Function Summary:
 *
 * This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) where members can:
 * 1.  Become Members: Join the collective by staking a certain amount of token.
 * 2.  Propose Art Submissions: Submit their digital artwork (NFT) for consideration.
 * 3.  Vote on Art Submissions: Members vote on submitted artworks to be accepted into the collective's official collection.
 * 4.  Curate Art Collections: Create curated collections of artworks within the collective.
 * 5.  Vote on Curator Roles:  Members vote to elect curators who manage collections.
 * 6.  Stake for Governance Power: Stake tokens to increase voting power.
 * 7.  Delegate Voting Power: Delegate voting power to another address.
 * 8.  Create Proposals: Propose changes to DAAC parameters (membership fee, curation rules, etc.).
 * 9.  Vote on Proposals: Members vote on governance proposals.
 * 10. Execute Proposals:  Execute approved proposals to update contract state.
 * 11. Treasury Management:  DAAC manages a treasury funded by membership fees and potentially art sales.
 * 12. Distribute Rewards: Distribute treasury funds to members based on participation or staking.
 * 13. Fractionalize Collective Art:  Fractionalize ownership of collective artworks and distribute to members (concept).
 * 14. Implement Dynamic Membership Fee: Adjust membership fee based on treasury balance or member count.
 * 15. Support Different Art NFT Standards:  Handle various NFT standards (ERC721, ERC1155).
 * 16. Set Art Submission Fees:  Introduce fees for submitting art to deter spam.
 * 17. Implement Quadratic Voting: Use quadratic voting for fairer governance decisions.
 * 18. On-chain Reputation System: Track member contributions and build a reputation score.
 * 19. Community Challenges/Bounties: Create challenges and reward members for specific tasks.
 * 20. Emergency Pause Mechanism: Implement a pause function for critical situations.
 * 21. View Functions: Numerous view functions to query contract state (member count, artwork details, proposal status, etc.).
 * 22. Event Emission: Emit events for all significant actions for off-chain monitoring.
 *
 * This contract is a conceptual example and requires further development, security audits, and consideration of gas optimization for production use.
