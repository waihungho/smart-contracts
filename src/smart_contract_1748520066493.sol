Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts within the theme of a decentralized research and funding DAO.

This contract simulates a platform where members propose research projects, community members (who stake to become members) vote on them, fund them, and potentially review results for rewards. It includes elements of governance, funding, state machines, role-based access, staking, delegation, and a simulated mechanism for on-chain randomness for bonus distribution.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is for educational purposes to demonstrate advanced concepts. It has *not* been audited and should *not* be used in a production environment without extensive testing and security reviews. Concepts like full randomness integration (Chainlink VRF), complex tokenomics, and gas optimizations are simplified or represented by patterns.

// --- Astro Research DAO ---
// This contract orchestrates a decentralized process for proposing, funding,
// and reviewing research projects. It leverages community governance, staking
// for membership, and a state machine to manage project lifecycle.

// --- Outline ---
// 1. State Variables: Core data structures, parameters, and counters.
// 2. Enums: Define the different states a research proposal can be in.
// 3. Structs: Define the structure of a Research Proposal.
// 4. Events: Log key actions for transparency.
// 5. Modifiers: Control access and state changes.
// 6. Constructor: Initialize the contract and key parameters.
// 7. Admin Functions: pause/unpause, update parameters, emergency withdrawal, curator management.
// 8. Membership Functions: become member (stake), claim stake, delegation.
// 9. Treasury/Funding Functions: Donate, fund project, claim project funds.
// 10. Proposal Management: Submit, cancel.
// 11. Voting Functions: Start voting, vote, end voting.
// 12. Project Execution & Review: Submit results, review, flag dispute, resolve dispute, distribute rewards.
// 13. Randomness Integration (Simulated): Trigger randomness for bonus, handle callback.
// 14. Utility/View Functions: Check status, get details.

// --- Function Summary ---
// Admin/Config:
// - constructor(): Initializes admin, staking requirement, and default periods.
// - addCurator(address account): Grants curator role.

// - updateResultReviewPeriod(uint256 duration): Sets duration for result review/dispute.
// - pause(): Pauses contract-wide critical functions (admin only).
// - unpause(): Unpauses contract (admin only).

// - claimFundsForExecution(uint256 proposalId): Proposer claims funded amount to execute project.
// - withdrawTreasuryFunds(address recipient, uint256 amount): Withdraws from general treasury (governance/admin decision logic needed, simplified here).
//
// Proposal Management:
// - submitResearchProposal(string memory descriptionHash, uint256 fundingGoal): Submit a new project proposal.
// - cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId): Proposer cancels proposal before voting starts.
//
// Voting:
