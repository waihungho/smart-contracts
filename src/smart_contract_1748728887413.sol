Okay, let's design a complex, creative, and trendy smart contract. We'll combine concepts like decentralized project management, dynamic NFTs, a reputation system, and tokenomics.

**Theme:** A "Decentralized Creative Studio & Project Launchpad" where members collaborate on projects, earn reputation, share revenue, and launch dynamic NFTs tied to project success.

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Definition & Imports:** Standard Solidity setup with OpenZeppelin for safety (Ownable, Pausable).
2.  **Interfaces:** For interacting with external ERC20 token (native token for staking/rewards) and potentially ERC721 (if we were fully implementing the NFT contract here, but we'll simulate dynamic data storage).
3.  **Errors:** Custom errors for clarity and gas efficiency.
4.  **Events:** For transparency and off-chain monitoring.
5.  **Enums:** To define states and types (MemberRole, ProjectStatus, ProposalState, ProposalType).
6.  **Structs:** To define complex data types (Member, Project, Proposal, DynamicNFTData).
7.  **State Variables:** Mappings, counters, addresses, configuration parameters.
8.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state checks.
9.  **Core Logic:** Functions grouped by category:
    *   **Admin/Setup:** Initial configuration, managing core parameters.
    *   **Membership Management:** Adding, removing, updating members and roles.
    *   **Project Management:** Creating, funding, managing, completing projects.
    *   **Reputation System:** Calculating and retrieving member reputation.
    *   **Dynamic NFTs:** Minting NFTs linked to projects and providing dynamic data.
    *   **Revenue Distribution:** Distributing funds from completed projects.
    *   **Tokenomics/Staking:** Staking native tokens, managing staked balances, (conceptual) reward claiming.
    *   **Governance:** Submitting, voting on, and executing proposals.
    *   **Utility/Inspection:** Getting details, checking balances, pausing.

**Function Summary (> 20 Functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes contract owner, admin role, and token address.
2.  `addAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Grants admin role.
3.  `removeAdmin(address _adminToRemove)`: Revokes admin role.

6.  `addMember(address _memberAddress, MemberRole _role)`: Adds a new member with a specific role.
7.  `removeMember(address _memberAddress)`: Deactivates a member.
8.  `updateMemberRole(address _memberAddress, MemberRole _newRole)`: Changes a member's role.
9.  `createProject(string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Creates a new project entry.

23. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote (for/against) on a proposal. Vote weight could be based on staked tokens + reputation.
24. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal after the voting deadline.
25. `batchDistributeContributionRewards(address[] calldata _members, uint256[] calldata _amounts, address _tokenAddress)`: Allows batch distribution of rewards (ETH or ERC20) to multiple members (e.g., based on off-chain contribution assessment or reputation score snapshots).
26. `pause()`: Pauses contract operations (critical functions).
27. `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract.
28. `emergencyWithdrawETH(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows owner/admin to withdraw stuck ETH.
29. `emergencyWithdrawToken(address _tokenAddress, address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows owner/admin to withdraw stuck tokens.
