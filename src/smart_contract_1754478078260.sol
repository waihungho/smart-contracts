Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Creating something truly unique while hitting "advanced, creative, trendy, and non-duplicative" with 20+ functions requires thinking outside the typical DeFi/NFT boxes.

Let's design a contract called **"ChronoCaster Nexus"**.

**Core Concept:**
ChronoCaster Nexus is a decentralized platform for *programmable time-locked commitments and conditional future actions*, built around a unique "Augury" system. Users can submit "Auguries" (on-chain predictions/commitments with a commit-reveal scheme), and other users can create "Pledges" that are only executed if specific Auguries resolve in a certain way, or if general on-chain/off-chain conditions are met at a future timestamp. It incorporates a reputation system for Augurs and a decentralized "Keeper Network" to execute timed/conditional transactions, abstracting gas costs for pledgers.

**Why it's unique, advanced, creative, and trendy:**

1.  **Commit-Reveal Auguries:** Users "predict" or "commit" to a future state (e.g., "ETH price > $X by Y date", "Z event will happen"). They submit a hash first, then reveal the actual value later. This prevents front-running and manipulation.
2.  **Conditional Pledges:** Users can lock assets or specify actions that only execute *if* one or more specific Auguries resolve accurately, *or* if a general on-chain/off-chain condition is met at a future point. This creates a powerful "if-this-then-that-in-the-future" programmable money primitive.
3.  **Decentralized Keeper Network:** To enable gasless execution of pledges for the original creator, the contract integrates a concept similar to Chainlink Keepers or Gelato Network. Registered "Keepers" are incentivized to call `executePledge` when conditions are met, paying gas on behalf of the pledger and getting reimbursed/rewarded from a pool.
4.  **Augur Reputation System:** Predictors (Augurs) gain reputation scores based on the accuracy of their Auguries, encouraging honest and insightful contributions.
5.  **Dispute Resolution:** A mechanism to challenge inaccurate Auguries or failed pledge executions.
6.  **Time-Based Logic:** Extensive use of timestamps for revelations, resolutions, executions, and expiries.
7.  **Beyond Simple NFTs/Tokens:** While it could interact with ERC-20/721 for pledges, its core functionality is about *time-based, conditional logic and execution*, not just asset ownership.
8.  **Potential Use Cases:** Decentralized escrow with future conditions, conditional donations, on-chain prophecy markets, automated vesting triggered by external events, highly flexible trustless agreements.

#### Function Summary (27 Functions):

**1. Access Control & Configuration:**
    *   `constructor()`: Initializes owner, sets initial oracle/moderators.
    *   `setOracleAddress(address _newOracle)`: Sets the trusted external oracle for resolving specific auguries. (Owner)
    *   `setDisputeResolutionFee(uint256 _fee)`: Sets the fee required to initiate a dispute. (Owner)
    *   `pauseContract()`: Pauses core functionality in emergencies. (Owner)
    *   `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract. (Owner)
    *   `withdrawContractFunds(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Withdraws collected fees or specified tokens. (Owner)
    *   `addModerator(address _moderator)`: Grants dispute resolution and specific moderation powers. (Owner)
    *   `removeModerator(address _moderator)`: Revokes moderator powers. (Owner)
    *   `configureAuguryType(uint256 _typeId, uint256 _minStake, uint256 _maxStake, uint256 _revealPeriod, uint256 _resolutionPeriod)`: Configures parameters for different augury categories (e.g., market predictions vs. event predictions). (Owner)

**2. Augury Management (Commit-Reveal):**
    *   `submitAugury(uint256 _auguryType, bytes32 _predictionHash, uint256 _revealTimestamp, uint256 _resolutionTimestamp) payable`: Commits to a future prediction by providing its hash and staking collateral. The actual prediction is revealed later.
    *   `revealAugury(uint256 _auguryId, string calldata _actualPrediction)`: Reveals the actual prediction for a previously submitted augury. Must be done within the reveal window.
    *   `resolveAugury(uint256 _auguryId, bool _isAccurate, uint256 _actualValue, bytes calldata _proofData)`: Resolves an augury's accuracy. This function is typically called by the configured `oracleAddress` or a trusted resolver, providing proof of accuracy.
    *   `challengeAugury(uint256 _auguryId) payable`: Allows any user to challenge the resolution of an augury, requiring a dispute fee.
    *   `settleDispute(uint256 _auguryId, bool _augurWasCorrect)`: A moderator or a DAO (if integrated) settles an ongoing dispute, updating the augury's status and reputation.

**3. Pledge Management (Conditional Execution):**
    *   `createPledge(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _amount, address _targetAddress, uint256[] calldata _auguryDependencies, bytes32 _executionConditionHash, uint256 _expiryTimestamp) payable`: Creates a conditional pledge, locking assets that will only be transferred to `_targetAddress` if specified auguries resolve correctly AND/OR an on-chain/off-chain condition represented by `_executionConditionHash` is met before `_expiryTimestamp`.
    *   `updatePledgeExecutionCondition(uint256 _pledgeId, bytes32 _newExecutionConditionHash, uint256[] calldata _newAuguryDependencies)`: Allows the pledger to modify the conditions for an unexecuted pledge.
    *   `revokePledge(uint256 _pledgeId)`: Allows the original pledger to cancel an unexecuted pledge and reclaim their assets, if it hasn't expired.

**4. Keeper Network:**
    *   `registerKeeper() payable`: Allows users to register as a Keeper by staking a minimum amount. Keepers can execute pledges for others.
    *   `deregisterKeeper()`: Allows a registered Keeper to unregister and reclaim their stake after a cooldown.
    *   `fundKeeperPool() payable`: Allows anyone to contribute to the pool that rewards Keepers for executing pledges.
    *   `executePledgeWithKeeper(uint256 _pledgeId, bytes calldata _onChainProof)`: Called by a registered Keeper. If the pledge conditions are met (checked internally with `_onChainProof` for the condition hash), the pledge is executed, and the Keeper receives a reward from the `keeperPool`.
    *   `claimKeeperReward()`: Allows a Keeper to claim accumulated rewards from the `keeperPool`.

**5. View Functions:**
    *   `getAugurReputation(address _augur)`: Returns the current reputation score and accuracy metrics for an augur.
    *   `getAuguryAccuracyHistory(address _augur)`: Returns a list of past auguries by an augur and their accuracy status.
    *   `getAuguryDetails(uint256 _auguryId)`: Returns all details of a specific augury.
    *   `getPledgeDetails(uint256 _pledgeId)`: Returns all details of a specific pledge.
    *   `getPendingAuguriesForUser(address _augur)`: Returns a list of auguries submitted by a user that are awaiting reveal or resolution.
    *   `getExecutablePledges(uint256 _startIndex, uint256 _batchSize)`: Returns a batch of pledge IDs that are potentially ready for execution (e.g., their expiry has not passed, and dependencies might be resolved). Useful for Keepers.
    *   `isKeeperRegistered(address _addr)`: Checks if an address is a registered Keeper.
    *   `getKeeperRewardBalance(address _keeper)`: Returns the outstanding reward balance for a specific Keeper.
    *   `getContractStatus()`: Returns general status information about the contract (paused, total auguries, total pledges, etc.).
