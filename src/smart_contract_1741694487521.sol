/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Modify as needed)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to submit,
 *      curate, and sell digital art, governed by its members. This contract implements
 *      advanced concepts like on-chain governance, dynamic royalties, generative art integration,
 *      and community-driven features.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `requestMembership()`: Allows users to request membership to the collective.
 *    - `approveMembership(address _user)`: Admin/Governance function to approve membership requests.
 *    - `revokeMembership(address _user)`: Admin/Governance function to revoke membership.
 *    - `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Submission and Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string memory _metadataURI, string memory _artworkType)`: Members submit artwork with metadata URI and type.
 *    - `voteOnArtworkSubmission(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on submitted artworks.
 *    - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves the curation status of an artwork.
 *    - `startCurationRound()`: Admin/Governance function to start a new curation round.
 *    - `endCurationRound()`: Admin/Governance function to end the current curation round and process results.
 *    - `getApprovedArtworks()`: Returns a list of IDs of artworks that have been approved.
 *
 * **3. Generative Art Integration (Example Feature):**
 *    - `generateArtParameters(uint256 _seed)`: (Example) Allows members to request parameters for generative art based on a seed.
 *    - `mintGenerativeArtwork(uint256 _seed, string memory _metadataURI)`: (Example) Members can mint generative art using parameters and submit it.
 *
 * **4. Dynamic Royalties and Revenue Sharing:**
 *    - `setArtworkRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Artist can set royalty percentage for their artwork (within limits).
 *    - `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase approved artworks.
 *    - `withdrawRoyalties()`: Artists can withdraw accumulated royalties.
 *    - `distributeCollectiveFunds()`: Governance function to distribute funds from collective sales/donations to members or treasury.
 *
 * **5. On-Chain Governance and Proposals:**
 *    - `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Members can create governance proposals with calldata for contract actions.
 *    - `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Governance function to execute approved proposals.
 *    - `getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the status of a governance proposal.
 *    - `updateGovernanceParameters(uint256 _newQuorum, uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`: Governance function to change governance parameters.
 *
 * **6. Community and Utility Functions:**
 *    - `donateToCollective()`: Allows users to donate ETH to the collective treasury.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about an artwork.
 *    - `getMemberDetails(address _memberAddress)`: Retrieves details about a member.

**Explanation of Functions and Concepts:**

1.  **Membership Management:**
    *   **`requestMembership()`**:  Users can request to join the collective by paying a membership fee.  In a real-world DAO, membership approval might be more complex, involving voting or other criteria.
    *   **`approveMembership(address _user)`**:  Governance (or admin initially) can approve membership requests.
    *   **`revokeMembership(address _user)`**:  Governance can revoke membership.
    *   **`isMember(address _user)`**:  Utility function to check membership status.
    *   **`getMemberCount()`**:  Returns the number of members.

2.  **Artwork Submission and Curation:**
    *   **`submitArtwork(string memory _metadataURI, string memory _artworkType)`**:  Members can submit their artwork. `_metadataURI` would point to off-chain metadata (like IPFS) describing the artwork (title, description, image URL, etc.). `_artworkType` categorizes the art (e.g., "Painting", "Generative", "Video").
    *   **`voteOnArtworkSubmission(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`**: Members vote to approve or reject submitted artwork.
    *   **`getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`**:  Checks the current curation status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
    *   **`startCurationRound()`**:  Starts a new curation round (in more advanced versions, this could batch process submissions).
    *   **`endCurationRound()`**: Ends a curation round and processes the results (in this simplified version, curation happens on vote quorum).
    *   **`getApprovedArtworks()`**: Returns a list of IDs of approved artworks.

3.  **Generative Art Integration (Example):**
    *   **`generateArtParameters(uint256 _seed)`**:  *(Example - needs off-chain integration)* This is a placeholder function to demonstrate how you might integrate generative art. In a real system, this would likely interact with an off-chain service (using oracles like Chainlink Functions or API3) to generate parameters for generative art based on a seed provided by the user. The parameters could be JSON describing style, colors, shapes, etc., to be used by a generative art algorithm.
    *   **`mintGenerativeArtwork(uint256 _seed, string memory _metadataURI)`**: *(Example - assumes parameters are generated)*  Allows members to "mint" generative art. It assumes `generateArtParameters` has been called, and parameters are available.  It creates an `Artwork` entry, marks it as "Generative," and approves it (in this example, generative art bypasses normal curation, but this could be changed).

4.  **Dynamic Royalties and Revenue Sharing:**
    *   **`setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`**: Artists can set the price for their approved artwork.
    *   **`purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`**:  Users can purchase approved artworks. The contract handles splitting the payment: a royalty goes to the artist, and the rest goes to the collective treasury.
    *   **`withdrawRoyalties()`**: Artists can withdraw their accumulated royalties from the contract.
    *   **`distributeCollectiveFunds()`**: Governance (or admin) can distribute funds from the collective treasury. This could be used to fund community projects, reward active members, or for other DAO purposes.
    *   **`setDefaultRoyaltyPercentage(uint256 _percentage)`**: Governance can set the default royalty percentage for new artworks.
    *   **`setArtworkRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`**: Artists can override the default royalty percentage for their specific artwork (within limits set by governance potentially).

5.  **On-Chain Governance and Proposals:**
    *   **`createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`**: Members can create governance proposals.  `_calldata` is the crucial part. It's encoded data that, when executed, will call a function on *this contract itself*. This allows for on-chain governance actions (e.g., changing parameters, upgrading the contract - with more complex proxy patterns).
    *   **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: Members vote for or against governance proposals.
    *   **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Governance (or admin) executes a passed proposal. This function actually makes the call using the `_calldata` stored in the proposal.
    *   **`getProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`**:  Checks the status of a governance proposal (Pending, Active, Passed, Rejected, Executed).
    *   **`updateGovernanceParameters(uint256 _newQuorum, uint256 _newVotingPeriod)`**: Governance function to change governance parameters like the voting quorum and voting period.
    *   **`setGovernanceContract(address _newGovernanceContract)`**: Allows the admin to delegate governance responsibilities to a separate governance contract (for more complex governance logic, potentially).

6.  **Community and Utility Functions:**
    *   **`donateToCollective()`**:  Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective treasury.
    *   **`getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`**:  Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
    *   **`getMemberDetails(address _memberAddress)`**: Checks if an address is a member.
    *   **`getContractBalance()`**: Utility function to check the contract's ETH balance.
    *   **`receive() external payable`**:  Fallback function to handle direct ETH transfers to the contract (treated as donations).

**Advanced Concepts and Trendy Aspects:**

*   **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Principles:** The contract implements core DAO concepts: membership, governance, collective treasury, and community-driven decision-making (curation, governance proposals).
*   **NFTs and Digital Art:**  While not explicitly minting ERC721 tokens in this simplified version, the contract manages digital artworks and their metadata URIs, which is the foundation for NFT integration. You could easily extend it to mint NFTs upon artwork approval.
*   **On-Chain Governance:**  Governance proposals and voting allow the community to directly control aspects of the contract and the collective.
*   **Dynamic Royalties:**  Artists can set royalties, and the contract automatically handles royalty distribution on sales.
*   **Generative Art Integration (Example):**  Shows a potential direction for integrating AI and generative art workflows into the DAO.
*   **Community Curation:** Artworks are curated by the community through voting, aligning with decentralized and democratic principles.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Security:** This contract is for illustrative purposes and lacks thorough security auditing. In a production environment, you would need to carefully review and audit the code for vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control issues, etc.).
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract is not optimized for gas efficiency. For a real-world application, you would need to consider gas costs and optimize functions, data structures, and storage usage.
*   **Off-Chain Interaction:**  For features like generative art parameter generation, IPFS metadata storage, and more complex governance, you would need to integrate with off-chain services (oracles, decentralized storage, etc.).
*   **Scalability:** For a large community and art collection, you might need to consider scalability solutions and potentially more advanced data management strategies.
*   **Error Handling and User Experience:**  More robust error handling and user-friendly events would be needed for a production-ready contract.

This smart contract provides a foundation for a creative and trendy Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective. You can expand upon these features and concepts to build a more comprehensive and feature-rich platform.
