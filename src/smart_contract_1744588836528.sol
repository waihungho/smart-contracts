/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Please replace with your name)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit, curate, exhibit, and potentially monetize their digital art, governed by its members.

 * **Contract Outline:**

 * **Membership Management:**
 *   - `joinCollective()`: Allows users to join the art collective.
 *   - `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective.
 *   - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members.
 *   - `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *   - `setMembershipFee(uint256 _fee)`: Allows owner to set the membership fee.
 *   - `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the current membership fee.
 *   - `withdrawMembershipFees()`: Allows owner to withdraw accumulated membership fees.

 * **Art Submission and Curation:**
 *   - `submitArt(string memory _artMetadataURI)`: Allows members to submit their art for consideration.
 *   - `voteOnArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on art submissions.
 *   - `getCurationQuorum()`: Returns the quorum needed for art curation votes.
 *   - `setCurationQuorum(uint256 _quorum)`: Allows owner to set the curation quorum.
 *   - `getArtSubmissionStatus(uint256 _submissionId)`: Returns the status of an art submission.
 *   - `getApprovedArtCount()`: Returns the count of approved artworks.
 *   - `getApprovedArtByIndex(uint256 _index)`: Returns the ID of an approved artwork at a given index.
 *   - `burnRejectedArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId)`: Allows submitter to burn rejected submission (if they wish).

 * **Exhibition and Display:**
 *   - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionTitle, uint256[] memory _artworkIds)`: Allows curators (members with curator role) to create exhibitions.
 *   - `voteOnExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on proposed exhibitions.
 *   - `getExhibitionStatus(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns the status of an exhibition.
 *   - `getApprovedExhibitionCount()`: Returns the count of approved exhibitions.
 *   - `getApprovedExhibitionByIndex(uint256 _index)`: Returns the ID of an approved exhibition at a given index.
 *   - `addCurator(address _curator)`: Allows owner to add curator role to a member.
 *   - `removeCurator(address _curator)`: Allows owner to remove curator role from a member.
 *   - `isCurator(address _user)`: Checks if an address has curator role.

 * **Advanced/Trendy Functions:**
 *   - `delegateCurationVote(uint256 _submissionId, address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their curation vote to another member.
 *   - `reportArtSubmission(uint256 _submissionId, string memory _reportReason)`: Allows members to report potentially inappropriate art submissions.
 *   - `resolveArtReport(uint256 _submissionId, bool _removeArt)`: Allows curators to resolve art reports, potentially removing art.
 *   - `setArtSubmissionFee(uint256 _fee)`: Allows owner to set a fee for art submissions.
 *   - `getArtSubmissionFee()`: Returns the current art submission fee.
 *   - `withdrawSubmissionFees()`: Allows owner to withdraw accumulated art submission fees.
 *   - `emergencyShutdown()`: Allows owner to pause critical functions in case of emergency.
 *   - `resumeContract()`: Allows owner to resume contract after emergency shutdown.
 *   - `getContractStatus()`: Returns the current contract status (active/paused).

 * **Function Summary:**

 * **Membership:** Functions to manage collective membership, fees, and member status.
 * **Art Curation:** Functions for artists to submit their work, for members to vote on submissions, and for managing the curation process.
 * **Exhibition Management:** Functions for curators to propose exhibitions and for members to vote on them, managing approved exhibitions.
 * **Governance & Advanced Features:** Functions for vote delegation, reporting content, resolving reports, managing submission fees, and emergency contract control.
