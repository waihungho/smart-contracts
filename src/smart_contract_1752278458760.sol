Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "Decentralized Innovation Hub". This concept combines elements of decentralized governance, project funding based on milestones, reputation-weighted participation, and a basic on-chain representation of project output and licensing revenue distribution.

It aims to be creative by integrating reputation, milestone-based funding approved by stakeholders, and a symbolic on-chain IP registration/licensing revenue share mechanism, moving beyond standard DAO or crowdfunding patterns. It has well over 20 functions.

### Decentralized Innovation Hub Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Overview:** Manages a decentralized hub for funding and developing innovative projects.
2.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Membership:** Users register to become members.
    *   **Reputation:** Earned through participation (voting, funding, successful project completion).
    *   **Proposals:** Members submit project ideas.
    *   **Voting:** Members vote on proposals, with vote weight determined by reputation.
    *   **Funding:** Approved proposals can receive funding, managed via milestones.
    *   **Milestones:** Project funds released incrementally upon completion of predefined stages, requiring approval.
    *   **IP Registration (Symbolic):** Register a hash/link representing the project's output (code, design, etc.).
    *   **Licensing Revenue Share (Symbolic):** Distribute revenue from "licensing" the project output amongst contributors based on predefined shares.
    *   **Treasury:** Holds hub funds (submission fees, licensing share).
3.  **Data Structures:** Enums for states, Structs for Proposals, Milestones, Licensing Info.
4.  **State Variables:** Mappings for members, proposals, reputation; Counters; Configuration parameters (fees, periods, thresholds).
5.  **Functions:**
    *   Membership Management
    *   Proposal Submission & Retrieval
    *   Voting Mechanism (Reputation-Weighted)
    *   Funding & Milestone Management
    *   Reputation Management (Internal & Public Getter)
    *   IP Registration & Licensing Revenue Distribution
    *   Parameter Configuration
    *   Treasury Management
    *   Helper Functions
6.  **Events:** Signalling key state changes and actions.
7.  **Modifiers:** Access control.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
2.  `registerMember()`: Allows an address to register as a member of the hub.
3.  `isMember(address memberAddress)`: Checks if an address is a registered member.
4.  `getReputation(address memberAddress)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a member.
5.  `submitProposal(string calldata title, string calldata description, uint256 fundingGoal, string[] calldata milestoneDescriptions, uint256[] calldata milestoneAmounts)`: Allows a member to submit a new project proposal, including funding goal and milestones. Requires a submission fee.
6.  `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a specific proposal.
7.  `listProposalsByState(ProposalState state)`: Lists IDs of proposals currently in a given state. (Note: Iterating maps is gas-intensive; this is simplified).
8.  `vote(uint256 proposalId, VoteChoice choice)`: Allows a member to cast a reputation-weighted vote on a proposal during the voting phase.
9.  `endVoting(uint256 proposalId)`: Ends the voting period for a proposal if the time is up and calculates results, transitioning the state.
10. `getVotingResults(uint256 proposalId)`: Gets the current vote counts and total reputation weighted votes for a proposal.
11. `fundProposal(uint256 proposalId) payable`: Allows anyone to contribute funds (ETH) to an *approved* proposal.
12. `getFundingStatus(uint256 proposalId)`: Retrieves current funding details for a proposal.
13. `requestMilestoneRelease(uint256 proposalId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: The proposal creator requests release of funds for a completed milestone.
14. `approveMilestoneRelease(uint256 proposalId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: A member (or designated role) approves the completion of a milestone for fund release.
15. `getMilestoneApprovals(uint256 proposalId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: Gets the approval status for a specific milestone.
16. `releaseFundsForMilestone(uint256 proposalId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: Releases funds for a milestone if it has received sufficient approvals and funds are available. Awards reputation to the creator.
17. `registerProjectOutputIP(uint256 proposalId, string calldata ipHashOrLink)`: Allows the creator of a *completed* proposal to register a symbolic link/hash for the project's output/IP.
18. `getProjectOutputIP(uint256 proposalId)`: Retrieves the registered IP hash/link for a project.
19. `licenseProjectOutput(uint256 proposalId) payable`: Allows someone to pay a "licensing fee" for a project's output. Revenue is held for distribution.
20. `distributeLicensingRevenue(uint256 proposalId)`: Distributes collected licensing revenue for a project among the creator, funders (symbolically), and the hub treasury based on predefined shares.
21. `setProposalSubmissionFee(uint256 fee)`: Owner sets the fee required to submit a proposal.
22. `setVotingPeriodDuration(uint256 duration)`: Owner sets the duration of the voting period in seconds.
23. `setMinMilestoneApprovalsRequired(uint256 count)`: Owner sets the minimum number of approvals needed to release a milestone's funds.
24. `setMinReputationToVote(uint256 reputation)`: Owner sets the minimum reputation required to cast a weighted vote.
25. `setApprovalThresholdNumerator(uint256 numerator)`: Owner sets the numerator for the weighted vote approval threshold (denominator is fixed at 100). E.g., 51 for 51%.
26. `setRevenueDistributionShares(uint256 creatorShare, uint256 fundersShare, uint256 treasuryShare)`: Owner sets the percentage shares for licensing revenue distribution. Must sum to 100.
27. `getTreasuryBalance()`: Gets the current balance of the hub's treasury.
28. `withdrawTreasuryFunds(uint256 amount)`: Owner can withdraw funds from the treasury. (Note: In a full DAO, this would require governance approval).
