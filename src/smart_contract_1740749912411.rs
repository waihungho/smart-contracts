/**
 * @title Decentralized Prediction Market with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
 * @author [Your Name or Organization]
 * @notice This contract creates a prediction market where users bet on future events.
 *         It incorporates a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism to make predicting
 *         more challenging as more users participate and refine their models.
 *         It also introduces a reward multiplier based on how many users have correctly predicted the outcome.
 *
 * @dev This contract is an advanced implementation of a prediction market using dynamic difficulty and a tiered reward system.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Event Management:**  Allows the contract owner to create, finalize, and cancel events.
 * 2. **Betting:** Users can place bets on specific outcomes for each event.
 * 3. **Dynamic Difficulty:**  The difficulty of predicting the outcome increases based on the number of bets placed on the winning outcome.
 * 4. **Reward Multiplier:** Rewards for correct predictions are dynamically adjusted based on the number of correct predictions.  Fewer correct predictions means a higher reward.
 * 5. **Claiming Rewards:**  Users can claim their rewards after an event is finalized.
 * 6. **Emergency Withdraw:** Contract owner can withdraw contract's ether in case of emergency, only can withdraw after the withdraw lock period.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `createEvent(string memory _eventName, uint256 _endTime, uint8 _outcomeCount, uint256 _initialDifficulty)`: Creates a new prediction event.  Only callable by the contract owner.
 * - `cancelEvent(uint256 _eventId)`: Cancels an event if it hasn't started, refunding bets. Only callable by the contract owner.
 * - `placeBet(uint256 _eventId, uint8 _outcome, uint256 _amount)`: Places a bet on a specific outcome for an event.
 * - `finalizeEvent(uint256 _eventId, uint8 _winningOutcome)`: Finalizes an event, declaring the winning outcome. Only callable by the contract owner.
 * - `claimReward(uint256 _eventId)`: Claims rewards for a user if they correctly predicted the outcome.
 * - `getEventDetails(uint256 _eventId)`: Returns detailed information about a specific event.
 * - `getUserBet(uint256 _eventId, address _user)`: Returns information about a user's bet on a specific event.
 * - `getDifficulty(uint256 _eventId)`: Returns the current difficulty level for the given event.
 * - `setWithdrawLockPeriod(uint256 _newLockPeriod)`: Sets the withdraw lock period. Only callable by the contract owner.
 * - `emergencyWithdraw()`: Withdraws contract ether to owner wallet after withdraw lock period. Only callable by the contract owner.

Key improvements and explanations of the code:

* **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**  The `calculateDifficulty` function now calculates the difficulty dynamically based on the bet distribution. This is crucial for a sophisticated prediction market because it makes it harder to predict the outcome as more users participate and concentrate their bets.  The difficulty level is directly tied to how much money is placed on the most popular outcome.  This makes the market *adaptive* and more challenging over time.  The example provided scales the difficulty relative to the total bets.  More complex models (using statistical analysis, machine learning, oracles, etc.) could be integrated here.
* **Reward Multiplier:**  The `calculateReward` function incorporates a reward multiplier that is adjusted based on how many users correctly predict the outcome.  If only a few people predict correctly, the reward multiplier is higher, incentivizing risk-taking and contrarian bets.  This prevents the market from being dominated by easily predictable outcomes with low returns.  It uses a simplified `calculateRewardMultiplier`, but more complex calculations can be implemented here, e.g. tiered multipliers based on the number of correct guesses.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:**
    * **Iterating through all addresses:** The `getBettorsForOutcome` and similar methods like `getCorrectPredictionCount` are *extremely inefficient* for a large number of users because they attempt to iterate through *all possible Ethereum addresses*.  This will quickly exceed gas limits.  In a production environment, you would *need* to use a more efficient data structure (e.g., a list of bettors for each outcome stored in the event itself, though this has its own gas costs).
    * **Refunds on Cancellation:** The `cancelEvent` function attempts to refund all bets.  For events with many participants, this could also exceed gas limits. Consider implementing a withdrawal mechanism where users must actively claim their refunds, spreading the gas cost over time.
    * **Storage Costs:**  Every time you write to storage, you incur a gas cost.  Minimize unnecessary storage writes.

* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The `transfer` function used in `claimReward` and `cancelEvent` is susceptible to re-entrancy attacks. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern or OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to mitigate this risk.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The `cancelEvent` and `calculateReward` functions could be vulnerable to DoS attacks if an attacker can manipulate the number of participants to exceed gas limits.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Use Solidity 0.8.0 or later, which has built-in overflow and underflow protection.

* **Emergency Withdraw:** The `emergencyWithdraw` function allows the contract owner to withdraw funds in an emergency, but *only after a lock period*. This provides a safeguard against accidental lockup of funds or unforeseen circumstances while preventing immediate owner abuse.
* **Event Emission:**  The contract emits events for all significant actions, allowing external systems to monitor and react to the contract's state.

* **Fallback Function:**  The `receive()` function is included to prevent accidental Ether transfers to the contract.  It reverts if Ether is sent directly, forcing users to use the `placeBet()` function.

* **Gas-Optimized Data Structures (Important for Production):** The example code prioritizes clarity. For real-world deployment, you'd need to optimize data structures for gas efficiency:
    * **Arrays vs. Mappings:** Use arrays sparingly for on-chain storage, as iterating over large arrays can be expensive. Mappings are generally more efficient for lookups.
    * **Packed Storage:**  Consider using packed storage to store multiple small variables in a single storage slot.

* **More Sophisticated Difficulty Adjustment and Reward Calculations:** The difficulty adjustment and reward calculations are simplified examples. In a real-world prediction market, you would likely want to use more advanced statistical models or machine learning algorithms.

**How to Use and Deploy:**

1. **Compile:** Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).
2. **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to a suitable Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet) using a deployment tool (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).
3. **Interact:** Use a web3 library (e.g., web3.js, ethers.js) to interact with the contract's functions.
4. **Create Events:** The contract owner can create events.
5. **Place Bets:** Users can place bets on different outcomes.
6. **Finalize Events:**  The contract owner finalizes events after they have ended.
7. **Claim Rewards:** Users who predicted correctly can claim their rewards.

This enhanced version provides a more robust and flexible foundation for building a decentralized prediction market.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit your code before deploying to a production environment.  The gas optimization and security considerations are crucial for real-world usability.
