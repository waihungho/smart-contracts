/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation and Utility Platform
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract platform that implements a dynamic reputation system and allows for the creation and access of various utilities based on user reputation.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **User Management:**
 *   - `registerUser()`: Allows users to register on the platform.
 *   - `getUserReputation(address user)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a user.
 *   - `isUserRegistered(address user)`: Checks if a user is registered.
 *
 * **Reputation System:**
 *   - `increaseReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Increases a user's reputation.
 *   - `decreaseReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Decreases a user's reputation.
 *   - `rewardActivity(address user, string memory activityType)`: Rewards users for specific activities, dynamically adjusting reputation gain.
 *   - `penalizeActivity(address user, string memory activityType)`: Penalizes users for negative activities, dynamically adjusting reputation loss.
 *   - `setActivityReward(string memory activityType, uint256 rewardAmount)`: Admin function to set reward amount for an activity.
 *   - `setActivityPenalty(string memory activityType, uint256 penaltyAmount)`: Admin function to set penalty amount for an activity.
 *   - `stakeForReputationBoost(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to stake tokens to temporarily boost their reputation gain rate.
 *   - `unstakeReputationBoost()`: Allows users to unstake tokens and revert to normal reputation gain rate.
 *
 * **Utility Management:**
 *   - `addUtility(string memory utilityName, string memory description, uint256 requiredReputation)`: Admin function to add a new utility to the platform.
 *   - `removeUtility(uint256 utilityId)`: Admin function to remove a utility.
 *   - `updateUtilityRequirement(uint256 utilityId, uint256 newReputationRequirement)`: Admin function to update the reputation requirement for a utility.
 *   - `getUtilityDetails(uint256 utilityId)`: Retrieves details of a specific utility.
 *   - `accessUtility(uint256 utilityId)`: Allows a registered user with sufficient reputation to access a utility.
 *   - `isUtilityAvailable(uint256 utilityId)`: Checks if a utility exists.
 *   - `getUtilitiesCount()`: Returns the total number of utilities available on the platform.
 *
 * **Governance & Platform Settings:**
 *   - `setBaseReputationGain(uint256 newGain)`: Admin function to set the base reputation gain per interaction.
 *   - `setStakingBoostMultiplier(uint256 newMultiplier)`: Admin function to set the multiplier for reputation boost from staking.
 *   - `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Allows the current owner to transfer ownership.
 *   - `withdrawContractBalance()`: Allows the owner to withdraw any Ether held by the contract.
