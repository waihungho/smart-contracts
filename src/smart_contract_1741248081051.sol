 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts like
 *      dynamic pricing, decentralized curation, fractional ownership, artist royalties, and community governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Gallery Management:**
 * 1. `initializeGallery(string _galleryName, address _curator, uint256 _curationFeePercentage)`: Initializes the gallery with a name, curator, and curation fee. (Admin/Owner function)
 * 2. `setGalleryName(string _newName)`: Updates the gallery's name. (Gallery Owner function)
 * 3. `setCurationFeePercentage(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: Updates the curation fee percentage. (Gallery Owner function)
 * 4. `setCurator(address _newCurator)`: Changes the gallery curator. (Gallery Owner function)
 * 5. `pauseGallery()`: Pauses core gallery functions like artwork submissions and purchases. (Gallery Owner function)
 * 6. `unpauseGallery()`: Resumes gallery operations after pausing. (Gallery Owner function)
 * 7. `withdrawGalleryBalance()`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw accumulated gallery balance (fees, etc.). (Gallery Owner function)
 *
 * **Artwork Management:**
 * 8. `submitArtwork(string _title, string _artistName, string _description, string _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows artists to submit artwork proposals for curation. (Public function)
 * 9. `curateArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _isApproved)`: Curator approves or rejects submitted artwork. (Curator function)
 * 10. `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Artist lists their approved artwork for sale. (Artist function)
 * 11. `updateArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Artist updates the price of their artwork. (Artist function)
 * 12. `cancelArtworkSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artist cancels the sale of their artwork. (Artist function)
 * 13. `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artwork listed for sale. (Public function)
 * 14. `burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the artist to burn their artwork, removing it from the gallery. (Artist function)
 *
 * **Fractional Ownership & Governance:**
 * 15. `fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Artists can fractionalize their artwork into ERC-20 tokens for community ownership. (Artist function)
 * 16. `buyFraction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Users can buy fractions of fractionalized artwork. (Public function)
 * 17. `proposeExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256[] _artworkIds)`: Fraction holders can propose exhibitions featuring specific artworks. (Fraction Holder function)
 * 18. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Fraction holders can vote on exhibition proposals. (Fraction Holder function)
 * 19. `executeExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an approved exhibition proposal, potentially featuring artworks in a virtual gallery. (Admin/Curator function)
 *
 * **Artist Royalty & Revenue Sharing:**
 * 20. `setSecondarySaleRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Artist sets a royalty percentage for secondary sales of their artwork. (Artist function)
 * 21. `withdrawArtistEarnings(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artist can withdraw their earnings from primary and secondary sales. (Artist function)
 *
 * **Utility & Information:**
 * 22. `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork. (Public function)
 * 23. `getGalleryDetails()`: Retrieves general information about the gallery. (Public function)
 * 24. `getTotalArtworksInGallery()`: Returns the total number of artworks currently in the gallery. (Public function)
 * 25. `getArtworksByArtist(address _artist)`: Returns a list of artwork IDs by a specific artist. (Public function)
 * 26. `getApprovedArtworks()`: Returns a list of IDs of artworks approved in the gallery. (Public function)
