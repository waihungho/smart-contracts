Okay, let's create a smart contract that acts as a dynamic, multi-asset vault with complex state management, conditional operations based on simulated external data, and layered access control, including a multi-condition lock and a timelocked migration process. We'll call it `QuantumFluxVault`.

It goes beyond simple staking or basic token holding by introducing "Flux States" that alter contract behavior, "Conditional Rules" tied to simulated oracle data affecting withdrawals/locks, and a robust migration mechanism.

/**
 * @title QuantumFluxVault
 * @dev A dynamic, multi-asset vault with configurable states, conditional logic, and timelocked migration.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Management: Define different operational "Flux States" (Enum).
 * 2. Configuration: Allow owner to configure allowed actions (deposit, withdraw) per Flux State.
 * 3. Asset Management: Hold ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. Track held assets. Allow listing allowed assets.
 * 4. Conditional Logic: Define "Conditional Rules" based on simulated oracle data.
 * 5. Conditional Operations: Execute withdrawals only if specific Conditional Rules are met.
 * 6. Access Control: Owner, Operator roles, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard.
 * 7. Multi-Condition Lock: Define multiple Conditional Rules that, if ALL met, trigger a Vault Lock preventing critical actions.
 * 8. Timelocked Migration: A secure process to migrate all assets to a new vault address with a configurable timelock.
 * 9. Rescue Functions: Allow owner to rescue accidentally sent non-allowed tokens.
 * 10. Events: Emit relevant events for transparency.
 *
 * Function Summary (20+ functions):
 *
 * State & Configuration:
 * - setFluxState: Sets the current operational state (FluxState enum).
 * - getFluxState: Returns the current operational state.
 * - setFluxStateConfig: Configures permissions (deposit/withdraw allowed) for a specific FluxState.
 * - getFluxStateConfig: Returns the configuration for a specific FluxState.
 * - updateOracleData: Simulates updating external data feeds used for conditions.
 * - getOracleData: Returns the current value for a specific oracle data key.
 * - setConditionalRule: Defines or updates a named conditional rule based on oracle data comparison.
 * - getConditionalRule: Returns the details of a named conditional rule.
 * - checkConditionalRule: Evaluates if a named conditional rule is currently met.
 *
 * Access Control & Safety:
 * - addOperator: Adds an address allowed to perform operator-specific actions.
 * - removeOperator: Removes an operator address.
 * - isOperator: Checks if an address is an operator.
 * - pauseVault: Pauses specific operations (owner/operator).
 * - unpauseVault: Unpauses specific operations (owner/operator).
 * - setVaultLockConditions: Defines which conditional rules trigger the multi-condition vault lock.
 * - checkVaultLock: Evaluates if the multi-condition vault lock is currently active.
 * - unsetVaultLockConditions: Removes configured vault lock conditions.
 * - rescueERC20: Allows owner to rescue accidentally sent non-allowed ERC20 tokens.
 * - rescueERC721: Allows owner to rescue accidentally sent non-allowed ERC721 tokens.
 *
 * Asset Management:
 * - setAllowedAssetStatus: Allows or disallows specific ERC20 or ERC721 contract addresses for deposit/withdrawal.
 * - isAssetAllowed: Checks if a specific asset address is allowed.
 * - listAllowedERC20Tokens: Returns a list of allowed ERC20 token addresses.
 * - listAllowedNFTCollections: Returns a list of allowed ERC721 collection addresses.
 * - getERC20Balance: Returns the vault's balance for a specific ERC20 token.
 * - getNFTCollectionBalance: Returns the count of NFTs held from a specific collection.
 * - isNFTTokenHeld: Checks if a specific NFT token ID from a collection is held by the vault.
 *
 * Vault Operations (Deposit/Withdraw):
 * - depositERC20: Deposits ERC20 tokens into the vault (respects state, lock, allowed status).
 * - depositERC721: Deposits ERC721 tokens into the vault (respects state, lock, allowed status).
 * - withdrawERC20: Withdraws ERC20 tokens from the vault (respects state, lock).
 * - withdrawERC721: Withdraws ERC721 token from the vault (respects state, lock).
 * - conditionalWithdrawERC20: Withdraws ERC20 only if a specified conditional rule is met (respects state, lock).
 * - conditionalWithdrawERC721: Withdraws ERC721 only if a specified conditional rule is met (respects state, lock).
 * - batchWithdrawERC20: Withdraws multiple ERC20 types/amounts in one transaction (respects state, lock).
 *
 * Timelocked Migration:
 * - setMigrationTarget: Sets the address of the new vault for migration (owner).
 * - initiateVaultMigration: Starts the timelock countdown for vault migration (owner, requires no lock).
 * - cancelVaultMigration: Cancels an ongoing migration process (owner/operator).
 * - executeVaultMigration: Executes the migration after the timelock expires (owner, requires no lock).
 * - getMigrationInitiationTime: Returns the timestamp when migration was initiated.
 * - getMigrationExecuteTime: Returns the earliest timestamp migration can be executed.
 * - getMigrationTarget: Returns the target address for migration.
 * - getMigrationTimelockDuration: Returns the required duration for the migration timelock.

             // A common pattern is to build an on-chain list or rely on off-chain indexing.
             // Since we store `heldNFTs[collection][tokenId]`, we could iterate over *all* possible tokenIds for that collection,
             // which is impossible. Or iterate over the `heldNFTs` map, which is also impossible.
             // A practical solution requires either:
             // 1. Relying on an off-chain process to list IDs and call a batch transfer function.
             // 2. Maintaining an explicit list of held token IDs on-chain (very gas-intensive).
             // 3. Requiring a migration function on the target vault that PULLS assets, knowing the old vault's state.

             // For this example, we will skip the actual ERC721 transfer loop here,
             // and add a note that this requires off-chain assistance or a different pattern.
             // We will emit an event indicating which collections *should* be migrated.

             // Practical migration would involve calling a batch transfer on the ERC721 contract or the target vault.
             // Example (conceptual, not implemented):
             // address[] memory tokenIdsToMigrate = // Get list of IDs for this collection from `heldNFTs` (impossible without iteration)
             // ERC721(collectionAddress).safeBatchTransferFrom(address(this), target, tokenIdsToMigrate); // If ERC721 supports batch
             // OR
             // QuantumFluxVault(payable(target)).receiveMigratedNFTs(address(this), collectionAddress, tokenIdsToMigrate);
             // Update internal state: Clear held status for migrated NFTs
             isNFTCollectionHeld[collectionAddress] = false; // Mark as not held in *this* vault
             // Need to clear individual `heldNFTs[collection][tokenId]` entries - also requires iterating IDs.
