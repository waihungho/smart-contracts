/**
 * @title Distributed AI Model Training and Contribution Reward System
 * @author Your Name / Organization
 * @dev This contract facilitates distributed training of AI models and rewards participants based on their contribution to the model's improvement.  It introduces a novel approach using on-chain data reputation scoring and a decentralized AI governance system.
 *
 * ### Outline:
 *  1.  **Data Pool:**  Manages data contributions for training, using a reputation system to assess data quality.
 *  2.  **Model Management:** Stores AI model metadata, versions, and training parameters.
 *  3.  **Training Task Allocation:**  Distributes training tasks to workers based on their stake and reputation.
 *  4.  **Contribution Assessment:**  Evaluates the impact of individual contributions on model performance using a reputation system.
 *  5.  **Reward Distribution:** Distributes rewards proportionally to contribution scores and stake.
 *  6.  **Governance:** A decentralized governance mechanism for proposing and voting on changes to training parameters, reward mechanisms, and model deployments.
 *
 * ### Function Summary:
 *   - **Data Pool:**
 *     - `submitData(bytes data, uint256 expectedOutcome) external:` Submit data for training with an expected outcome (used for reputation scoring).
 *     - `reportOutcome(uint256 dataId, bool correct) external:` Report whether the actual outcome matched the expected outcome of a submitted data point. Used to update data reputation.
 *     - `getDataReputation(uint256 dataId) public view returns (uint256):` Returns the reputation score of a specific data point.
 *   - **Model Management:**
 *     - `createModel(string modelName, string modelDescription) external onlyOwner:` Creates a new AI model.
 *     - `registerModelVersion(uint256 modelId, string modelHash, string ipfsUri) external onlyOwner:` Registers a new version of a model, storing its hash and IPFS URI.
 *     - `getModelLatestVersion(uint256 modelId) public view returns (uint256):` Returns the ID of the latest version of a model.
 *   - **Training Task Allocation:**
 *     - `requestTrainingTask(uint256 modelId) external returns (uint256 taskId):` Requests a training task for a specific model.
 *     - `claimTrainingTask(uint256 taskId) external:` Allows a worker to claim a training task.  Requires staking tokens.
 *     - `submitTrainingResult(uint256 taskId, string resultHash, string ipfsUri) external:` Submits the result of a training task.
 *   - **Contribution Assessment:**
 *     - `evaluateContribution(uint256 taskId) external onlyOwner:`  Evaluates the impact of a training result on the model's performance. This would involve on-chain or off-chain computation with a trusted oracle.
 *     - `getContributionScore(uint256 taskId) public view returns (uint256):` Returns the contribution score for a given task.
 *   - **Reward Distribution:**
 *     - `distributeRewards(uint256 modelId) external onlyOwner:` Distributes rewards to contributors based on their contribution scores and stake.
 *     - `withdrawRewards() external:` Allows contributors to withdraw their earned rewards.
 *   - **Governance:**
 *     - `proposeChange(string description, bytes data) external:` Proposes a change to the contract parameters (e.g., reward rates, data reputation weights).
 *     - `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool supports) external:` Votes on a proposed change.
 *     - `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external onlyOwner:` Executes a successful proposal.

Key improvements and explanations of the code:

*   **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  The documentation at the top clearly lays out the contract's purpose, its main components, and a summary of each function.  This is *crucial* for understanding and auditing the contract.
*   **Data Pool and Reputation:** The `DataPool` is a central innovation.  It stores training data and associates a reputation score with each data point. The `submitData` and `reportOutcome` functions enable crowd-sourced verification and quality control of the training data.  Data with more correct reports gets a higher reputation, influencing its selection for training.
*   **Model Management:**  This component handles the storage and versioning of AI models.  It tracks the model's hash and IPFS URI, allowing for verifiable access to model weights.  Storing the model hash allows for verification that a downloaded model matches what was registered.
*   **Training Task Allocation:** The `requestTrainingTask` and `claimTrainingTask` functions manage the distribution of training tasks.  Crucially, workers must *stake tokens* to participate, incentivizing honest behavior. The `selectDataPoint` function uses the data reputation to select the most trustworthy data for training.  This integrates the data quality feedback into the training process.
*   **Contribution Assessment:** The `evaluateContribution` function is a key area where further innovation is needed.  The provided example (`generateContributionScore`) is a *simplified* placeholder. A *real* implementation would require a *trusted Oracle or off-chain computation* to assess the actual improvement in the model's performance resulting from a training task. This is because Solidity has limitations that make it impossible to run a complex AI model directly on-chain.  Potential approaches include:
    *   **Oracle Integration:**  Using a Chainlink oracle to retrieve the updated model's performance on a benchmark dataset.
    *   **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):** Performing model evaluation within a TEE to ensure tamper-proof results.
    *   **ZK-SNARKs:**  Using ZK-SNARKs to prove that a computation was performed correctly without revealing the underlying data.
*   **Reward Distribution:** The `distributeRewards` function distributes rewards to workers based on their contribution score and stake. The rewards are proportionally distributed. The `withdrawRewards` function allows contributors to withdraw their earnings.
*   **Decentralized Governance:** The governance mechanism allows the community to propose and vote on changes to the contract's parameters. This is essential for adapting the training process and reward structure over time.
*   **Staking Mechanism:**  A staking mechanism is incorporated. Workers stake tokens to claim training tasks and those tokens can be seized if malicious behavior detected by the oracle, incentivizing good-faith efforts.
*   **Modifiers:**  `Modifiers` are used extensively to enforce access control and preconditions.  This makes the code more readable and secure.
*   **Events:**  `Events` are emitted to provide a clear audit trail of all important actions.
*   **Error Handling:**  `require` statements are used to check for errors and prevent invalid state transitions.
*   **Upgradeable Contract Pattern:** The basic implementation can be combined with the upgradeable contract pattern, for example, using UUPS proxy.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Gas optimization techniques are adopted, such as avoiding unnecessary loops and minimizing storage writes.
*   **Receive Function:** Added a receive function so that the smart contract can receive ETH.

**How this is novel and avoids duplication:**

*   **On-Chain Data Reputation:** The integrated data reputation system is a novel approach to addressing data quality in decentralized AI.  Most existing systems focus on model training incentives but not on the data itself.
*   **Decentralized AI Governance:** Combining AI model training with a decentralized governance mechanism is not common. This allows the community to adapt the system over time based on its performance and needs.
*   **Holistic Approach:**  This contract combines data management, model management, training task allocation, contribution assessment, and reward distribution into a single, integrated system. This end-to-end approach is less common than individual components.

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Oracle Security:**  The reliance on an Oracle for contribution assessment is a potential security risk.  The Oracle must be trustworthy and its data feeds must be secure.
*   **Reentrancy Attacks:**  The `withdrawRewards` function should be carefully audited for reentrancy vulnerabilities.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The `distributeRewards` function could be vulnerable to DoS attacks if the number of tasks or contributors is very large.
*   **Governance Attack:**  The governance mechanism must be designed to prevent malicious actors from gaining control and manipulating the system.

This contract provides a solid foundation for building a decentralized AI model training platform. The key is to implement a robust and secure contribution assessment mechanism and carefully consider the security implications of the Oracle and governance components. Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
