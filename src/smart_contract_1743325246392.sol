 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (An AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling artists to collaborate,
 * curate, and govern a digital art platform. This contract incorporates advanced concepts like decentralized
 * curation, collaborative artwork creation, dynamic royalty splits, on-chain licensing, and community governance.
 *
 * **Contract Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art Management:**
 *   - `createArtworkProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Artists propose new artworks for the collective.
 *   - `mintNFTForArtwork(uint256 _proposalId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved artwork proposal.
 *   - `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows users to purchase artworks from the collective.
 *   - `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price)`: Members can list collective artworks for sale.
 *   - `unlistArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Remove an artwork from sale.
 *   - `bidOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allow users to bid on artworks (auction mechanism).
 *   - `acceptBid(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _bidId)`: Accept the highest bid for an artwork.
 *   - `burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows governance to burn an artwork NFT under specific conditions.
 *
 * **2. Collaborative Art Creation & Revenue Sharing:**
 *   - `collaborateOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, address[] memory _newCollaborators)`: Add new collaborators to an existing artwork.
 *   - `setArtworkRoyaltySplit(uint256 _artworkId, address[] memory _recipients, uint256[] memory _percentages)`: Define custom royalty splits for artworks.
 *   - `claimArtistRevenue(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists can claim their share of revenue from artwork sales.
 *
 * **3. Decentralized Curation & Governance:**
 *   - `submitCurationProposal(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _justification)`: Members propose artworks for featured collections.
 *   - `voteOnCurationProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on curation proposals.
 *   - `executeCurationProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes approved curation proposals, adding artworks to collections.
 *   - `submitGovernanceProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Members propose changes to the collective's parameters or actions.
 *   - `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members vote on governance proposals.
 *   - `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes approved governance proposals.
 *   - `delegateVotingPower(address _delegatee)`: Allows members to delegate their voting power.
 *   - `stakeTokensForVotingPower(uint256 _amount)`: Members can stake tokens to increase their voting power.
 *   - `unstakeTokensForVotingPower(uint256 _amount)`: Members can unstake tokens, reducing voting power.
 *   - `setArtworkLicense(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _licenseType, string memory _licenseDetails)`: Set an on-chain license for an artwork.
 *
 * **4. Collective Management & Utility:**
 *   - `becomeMember()`: Allows users to become members of the collective (potentially with a fee or token requirement - can be extended).
 *   - `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Governance can revoke membership under certain conditions.
 *   - `donateToCollective()`: Allows anyone to donate to the collective's treasury.
 *   - `withdrawDonations(uint256 _amount)`: Governance can withdraw donations for collective purposes.
 *   - `emergencyShutdown()`:  A safety mechanism controlled by governance to halt critical functions in case of a critical bug or exploit.
