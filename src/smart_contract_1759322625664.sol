Here's a Solidity smart contract named `AetherForge` that aims to integrate interesting, advanced, creative, and trendy concepts around tokenized intellectual property (IP), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), fractional ownership, and AI-enhanced curation. It features over 20 functions, designed to be unique in its combination and specific implementations, rather than duplicating any single open-source project.

### AetherForge Contract: Dynamic DAO & Tokenized IP Platform with AI-Enhanced Curation

**Outline:**

The `AetherForge` contract acts as a central hub for a new paradigm of digital asset management. It combines several advanced functionalities:

1.  **Core Infrastructure & Access Control**: Basic ownership, pausing mechanisms, and linking to essential external modules (AFT Token, IP NFT Registry, DAO Governance, AI Oracle).
2.  **AetherForge Token (AFT) Management**: A utility and governance token (simulated ERC-20) for staking, voting power, and ecosystem rewards.
3.  **Intellectual Property (IP) NFT Management**: Advanced ERC-721-like features for registering, updating, licensing, and managing dynamic royalties for digital assets.
4.  **DAO Governance & Adaptive Parameters**: An integrated DAO (simulated) for community decision-making, including the ability to set adaptive quorum thresholds.
5.  **Fractional Ownership & Liquidity Layer**: Mechanisms to fractionalize high-value IP NFTs into fungible ERC-20 shares for broader ownership and liquidity, and to redeem them.
6.  **AI-Enhanced Curation & On-chain Data Integration**: A framework for integrating off-chain AI oracle assessments to influence IP value, royalties, and DAO parameters.
7.  **Advanced Marketplace & Ecosystem Functions**: Features like tokenized licensing pools and an on-chain IP challenge/arbitration system to ensure IP legitimacy.

---

**Function Summary:**

**I. Core & Access Control:**
1.  **`constructor`**: Initializes the contract with addresses for the AFT token, IP NFT registry, DAO governance module, and AI Oracle. Sets default AI influence factor.
2.  **`updateDAOModuleAddress`**: Allows the contract owner to update the address of the DAO governance module, enabling upgradeability for governance.
3.  **`pauseContract`**: Emergency function to pause critical operations, callable by the owner or designated DAO guardian.
4.  **`unpauseContract`**: Unpauses the contract after an emergency, callable by the owner or designated DAO guardian.

**II. AetherForge Token (AFT) - Governance & Utility Token:**
5.  **`mintAFT`**: Mints new AFT tokens to a specified address, primarily controlled by the DAO for ecosystem rewards or grants.
6.  **`stakeAFT`**: Allows users to lock AFT tokens in the contract to gain voting power within the DAO and potentially earn yield.
7.  **`unstakeAFT`**: Enables users to withdraw their previously staked AFT tokens.
8.  **`getVotingPower`**: Calculates and returns the current voting power of a given address, based on their staked AFT (could be time-weighted in advanced implementations).

**III. Intellectual Property (IP) - Advanced NFT Management:**
9.  **`registerNewIP`**: Allows a creator to mint a new Intellectual Property NFT (ERC-721) and link it to off-chain metadata (e.g., IPFS hash).
10. **`updateIPMetadataHash`**: Enables the IP owner (or DAO via proposal) to update the metadata hash associated with their IP NFT, ensuring data integrity for evolving digital assets.
11. **`setIPLicenseTemplate`**: Allows an IP owner to define a reusable template for licensing their IP, including general terms, duration, and usage rights.
12. **`grantTimeBoundLicense`**: Issues a specific, non-transferable license token/record for an IP, based on a template or custom terms, with a defined expiry date.
13. **`requestIPValuation`**: Triggers an off-chain AI oracle to perform a valuation and trend assessment for a specific IP, which the oracle will later submit on-chain.
14. **`distributeDynamicRoyalties`**: Calculates and distributes royalties for an IP (e.g., from sales or usage). Royalty splits are dynamic and can be influenced by AI assessments to reward high-performing or trending IPs.

**IV. DAO Governance & Adaptive Parameters:**
15. **`createProposal`**: Allows stakeholders with sufficient voting power to initiate new governance proposals for the DAO (e.g., funding, parameter changes, new features).
16. **`voteOnProposal`**: Enables users to cast their stake-weighted votes on active DAO proposals.
17. **`executeProposal`**: Executes a proposal once it has successfully passed the DAO voting process.
18. **`setAdaptiveQuorum`**: Allows the DAO (via proposal) to adjust the minimum voting power required for proposals to pass. This quorum can be made adaptive, potentially influenced by AI insights on community activity or market conditions.

**V. Fractional Ownership & Liquidity Layer:**
19. **`fractionalizeIPNFT`**: Converts a full IP NFT into a specified number of fungible ERC-20 shares. The original NFT is locked in the contract as a vault.
20. **`redeemFractionalIPNFT`**: Allows the owner of all outstanding fractional shares to burn them and retrieve the original, full IP NFT from the vault.

**VI. AI-Enhanced Curation & On-chain Data Integration:**
21. **`submitAIAssessmentReport`**: A trusted AI Oracle calls this function to record AI-generated insights for an IP, such as predicted market demand, uniqueness score, or risk factors.
22. **`setAIAgentInfluenceFactor`**: Enables the DAO (via proposal) to adjust the weight or influence that AI assessments have on internal contract parameters (e.g., dynamic royalty boosts, visibility scores).

**VII. Advanced Marketplace & Ecosystem Functions:**
23. **`listIPForTokenizedLicensing`**: Allows an IP owner to set up an automated system for issuing multiple licenses, potentially through an external licensing pool contract, based on predefined terms and pricing.
24. **`challengeIPRegistration`**: Provides a mechanism for users to dispute the legitimacy or originality of a registered IP. A small AFT stake is required, triggering a DAO arbitration process to resolve the dispute.
25. **`onERC721Received`**: Standard ERC721 receiver function, allowing the contract to accept IP NFTs when they are fractionalized and sent to the vault.
