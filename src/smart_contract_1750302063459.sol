Okay, let's create a Solidity smart contract concept focused on a dynamic, reputation-based asset management system.

This contract, tentatively named "AuraBoundAssets," allows users to deposit ERC-721 NFTs and interact with them or gain benefits based on an internal, non-transferable "Aura" score associated with their address. The Aura score is earned by staking a specific ERC-20 token within the contract. The contract introduces concepts like dynamic features unlocked by Aura, delegation of access/influence, and internal pooling/fractionalization based on Aura levels.

It avoids being a standard implementation of existing protocols by combining these elements in a novel way centered around the "Aura" mechanic.

**Outline and Function Summary: AuraBoundAssets**

This smart contract (`AuraBoundAssets`) manages deposited ERC-721 NFTs and links their utility and interaction possibilities to a user's non-transferable "Aura" score. Aura is earned by staking a designated ERC-20 token within the contract.

**I. Contract State & Core Concepts:**

*   **Aura:** A numerical score tied to a user address, representing their engagement/reputation within the system. It's earned by staking a specific ERC-20 token.
*   **Deposited NFTs:** ERC-721 tokens held by the `AuraBoundAssets` contract on behalf of users.
*   **Aura Pools:** Logical groupings of deposited NFTs, potentially allowing shared management or fractionalized internal ownership based on Aura.
*   **Delegation:** Users can delegate a portion of their *Aura-based capabilities* (not the Aura score itself) to other addresses.
*   **Dynamic Features:** Certain actions or utilities related to deposited assets are gated or modified based on the user's Aura level.

**II. Function Summary (27 Functions):**

1.  `constructor(address _stakeTokenAddress)`: Initializes the contract, setting the owner and the designated ERC-20 token for staking to earn Aura.
2.  `pauseContract()`: Owner-only function to pause sensitive contract operations (staking, deposits, withdrawals, specific actions).
3.  `unpauseContract()`: Owner-only function to unpause contract operations.
4.  `setAdmin(address newAdmin)`: Owner-only function to transfer contract ownership.
5.  `depositNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows a user to deposit an ERC-721 token they own into the contract. Requires prior approval of the NFT.
6.  `withdrawNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows a user to withdraw a deposited ERC-721 token. May have Aura-based conditions or fees.
7.  `listUserDepositedNFTs(address user)`: View function: Returns a list of (nftContract, tokenId) pairs deposited by a specific user.
8.  `getNFTDepositInfo(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: View function: Returns information about a deposited NFT (depositor, current status, pool association).
9.  `stakeForAura(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to stake the designated ERC-20 token to accrue Aura over time. Requires prior approval of the ERC-20.
10. `withdrawStake(uint256 amount)`: Allows a user to withdraw staked ERC-20 tokens. May incur penalties or lock-up periods.
11. `claimAura()`: Calculates and updates the user's Aura score based on their current stake and time since the last claim/stake action.
12. `getUserAura(address user)`: View function: Returns the current calculated Aura score for a user.
13. `getUserStakedAmount(address user)`: View function: Returns the amount of ERC-20 tokens currently staked by a user.
14. `setAuraCalculationParams(uint256 stakeWeight, uint256 timeWeight, uint256 timeScalingFactor)`: Owner-only function to adjust parameters influencing Aura calculation (simulated complexity).
15. `accessAuraGatedFeature(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 minAuraRequired)`: Example function demonstrating a feature gated by a minimum Aura level for a specific deposited NFT.
16. `delegateAuraPower(address delegatee, uint256 powerPercentage)`: Allows a user to delegate a percentage of their *effective* Aura power for specific actions to another address. Not transferring the score itself.
17. `getAuraDelegation(address delegator, address delegatee)`: View function: Returns the delegation percentage from a delegator to a delegatee.
18. `performDelegatedAction(address delegator, address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 minEffectiveAura)`: Allows a delegatee to perform an action on a deposited NFT using the delegator's effective Aura power (Aura * delegation %).
19. `createAuraPool(address[] nftContracts, uint256[] tokenIds)`: Allows a user (potentially requiring minimum Aura) to create a logical pool of *already deposited* NFTs they own.
20. `depositIntoAuraPool(uint256 poolId, address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows the pool owner (or delegatee with sufficient power/Aura) to add an owned, deposited NFT to a pool.
21. `withdrawFromAuraPool(uint256 poolId, address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows the pool owner (or delegatee) to remove an NFT from a pool.
22. `listPoolNFTs(uint256 poolId)`: View function: Returns a list of (nftContract, tokenId) pairs contained in a specific Aura Pool.
23. `assignPoolShares(uint256 poolId, address[] shareholders, uint256[] shares)`: Allows the pool owner (potentially requiring high Aura) to assign *internal, proportional rights* (simulated fractionalization) to the pool's contents among specified addresses.
24. `getPoolShares(uint256 poolId, address shareholder)`: View function: Returns the internal share percentage of a shareholder in a specific pool.
25. `claimAuraReward()`: Allows users to claim rewards (e.g., the staked ERC-20 token, or another token) based on their Aura level and potentially participation in pools. Rewards accrue over time based on Aura.
26. `rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Owner-only function to rescue ERC-20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract (excluding the designated stake token).
27. `rescueERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Owner-only function to rescue ERC-721 tokens accidentally sent to the contract.

**Explanation of Concepts and Why They Are Advanced/Creative:**

1.  **Aura System (Reputation/Engagement Score):**
    *   **Concept:** A non-transferable, internal score tied to an address's interaction and stake within the contract. Similar to Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) in principle (non-transferable identity attribute) but used purely for utility *within* this contract's ecosystem.
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** Moves beyond standard token holdings as the sole measure of participation. Creates a mechanism for progressive benefits and tiered access based on sustained engagement (staking over time), rather than just wealth or static ownership. The dynamic nature requires calculation logic.

2.  **Dynamic, Aura-Gated Features:**
    *   **Concept:** The functionality or status of a deposited asset (NFT) changes or unlocks based on the user's Aura score (`accessAuraGatedFeature`).
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** Makes NFTs more dynamic *in their utility* within the platform, even if the on-chain metadata of the ERC-721 itself doesn't change. It links an external state (user's Aura) to the internal state/capabilities associated with an asset. This is more complex than simple ownership checks.

3.  **Aura Delegation:**
    *   **Concept:** Allows users to grant others the *ability* to perform certain Aura-gated actions on their behalf, using their Aura score's *power*, without transferring the actual Aura score or asset ownership.
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** Introduces a form of liquid reputation or delegated authority. It's more nuanced than simple role-based access; it's permissioning based on a dynamic, user-earned metric. Useful for teams managing assets or granting temporary privileges.

4.  **Internal Aura Pooling with Shares:**
    *   **Concept:** Users can group deposited NFTs into logical pools. Internal "shares" of these pools can be assigned, granting proportional rights or benefits *within the contract's logic* (e.g., a percentage of rewards generated by the pool, or a vote proportional to shares in a related governance system - not implemented here).
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** A simplified, internal representation of fractionalization or shared ownership/management without minting new fungible tokens (like ERC-1155). It operates purely on the contract's internal state and rules, potentially linked back to Aura requirements for creation/management.

5.  **Dynamic Rewards/Penalties (Based on Aura):**
    *   **Concept:** Staking withdrawal penalties or claiming rewards are conditional on or scaled by the user's Aura level.
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** Links economic outcomes directly to the non-monetary engagement score. Encourages maintaining a high Aura to avoid penalties or maximize rewards, reinforcing the importance of the Aura system.

6.  **Simplified Aura Calculation:**
    *   **Concept:** Aura is calculated based on the amount staked and the duration of staking (`_updateAura`).
    *   **Advanced/Creative:** While the example calculation is simple (linear), the *concept* is that this could be a complex, multi-variable formula incorporating time, staked amount, activity within the contract (features accessed, pools managed), or even external data (via oracles). The adjustable parameters (`setAuraCalculationParams`) make it dynamically configurable.

**Why it's *not* a standard open-source contract:**

*   It's not just a generic ERC-20 or ERC-721.
*   It's not a standard staking contract (stake is for Aura, not direct yield).
*   It's not a standard escrow or vault (adds the Aura layer).
*   It's not a standard fractionalization protocol (shares are internal state, not new tokens).
*   It's not a standard DAO/governance contract (delegation is specific to Aura power, not generic voting).

This contract combines elements from these areas (staking, asset holding, access control, pooling) but structures them around the central, non-standard "Aura" mechanic to create a unique system for managing digital assets based on user reputation and engagement within the platform.
