 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, enabling artists to submit artworks,
 *      the community to curate and vote on them, and for the collective to manage a treasury, exhibitions,
 *      and potentially even AI-assisted art generation. This contract explores advanced concepts like
 *      governance, decentralized curation, dynamic NFTs, and on-chain randomness for unique features.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Artist Functions:**
 * 1. `submitArtwork(string _metadataURI, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows artists to submit a new artwork with metadata and initial price.
 * 2. `updateArtworkMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string _newMetadataURI)`: Artists can update the metadata of their submitted artworks (before curation ends).
 * 3. `withdrawArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Artists can withdraw their artwork if it's rejected during curation or before curation starts.
 * 4. `setArtworkSalePrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Artists can set or update the sale price of their accepted artworks.
 * 5. `getMyArtworks()`: Returns a list of artwork IDs submitted by the calling artist.
 *
 * **Curator/Community Functions:**
 * 6. `becomeCurator()`: Allows users to become curators by staking a certain amount of governance tokens.
 * 7. `leaveCurator()`: Allows curators to unstake their governance tokens and leave the curator role.
 * 8. `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Curators can vote to approve or reject submitted artworks.
 * 9. `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`:  View the current curation status (votes, quorum, result) of an artwork.
 * 10. `getStakedGovernanceTokens(address _curator)`: View the staked governance tokens of a curator.
 *
 * **Governance & Collective Functions:**
 * 11. `proposeNewParameter(string _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)`:  Curators can propose changes to key parameters like curation quorum, staking amounts, etc.
 * 12. `voteOnParameterProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Curators can vote on parameter change proposals.
 * 13. `executeParameterProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a parameter change proposal if it passes.
 * 14. `collectExhibitionFee(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the collective to collect an exhibition fee from artists when their artwork is accepted.
 * 15. `buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows anyone to buy an accepted artwork, transferring funds to the artist and a percentage to the collective treasury.
 * 16. `withdrawTreasuryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`:  Governed withdrawal of funds from the collective treasury (requires curator majority vote/proposal).
 * 17. `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256[] _artworkIds, string _exhibitionMetadataURI)`: Propose and create a curated exhibition of accepted artworks.
 * 18. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: View details of a specific exhibition.
 * 19. `getAllExhibitions()`: Get a list of all created exhibition IDs.
 * 20. `requestAIArtInspiration()`:  (Advanced Concept) Allows curators to request AI-generated art prompts/inspirations using an oracle, potentially for collaborative art generation.
 * 21. `reportArtworkForInappropriateContent(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows community members to report artworks for inappropriate content, triggering a review process.
 * 22. `resolveContentReport(uint256 _artworkId, bool _removeArtwork)`:  Governed function to resolve content reports and potentially remove artworks.
 * 23. `setGovernanceTokenAddress(address _tokenAddress)`: Owner-only function to set the governance token address.
 * 24. `setExhibitionFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Owner-only function to set the exhibition fee.
 * 25. `setTreasuryWithdrawalQuorum(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Owner-only function to set the quorum for treasury withdrawals.
 * 26. `setCuratorStakeAmount(uint256 _newStakeAmount)`: Owner-only function to set the curator staking amount.
 * 27. `setCollectiveTreasuryPercentage(uint256 _newPercentage)`: Owner-only function to set the percentage of sales going to the treasury.
