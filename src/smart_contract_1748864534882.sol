Okay, let's design an advanced DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) contract that incorporates several concepts like role-based access, reputation/contribution scoring, dynamic proposal types including arbitrary contract calls, emergency measures, and treasury management, going beyond standard token-weighted voting.

We will avoid directly copying standard open-source implementations like OpenZeppelin's `Governor` or `AccessControl` by implementing core logic manually using mappings and modifiers, while still adhering to best practices.

---

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This contract (`DecentralizedAutonomousOrganization`) implements a complex DAO structure enabling governed actions based on proposal voting.

1.  **State Variables:**
    *   Core configuration (proposal threshold, quorum, voting duration, min contribution).
    *   Counters (proposal ID, member count).
    *   Mappings for members, roles, contribution scores, delegates.
    *   Mapping for proposal details and voting results.
    *   Treasury state (approved assets, balances).
    *   Emergency state (paused status, emergency council).

2.  **Events:**
    *   `MemberAdded`, `MemberRemoved`, `ContributionUpdated`.
    *   `RoleGranted`, `RoleRevoked`.
    *   `DelegateChanged`, `VotingPowerUpdated`.
    *   `ProposalSubmitted`, `ProposalVoted`, `ProposalExecuted`, `ProposalCanceled`.
    *   `TreasuryDeposited`, `TreasuryWithdrawalRequested`, `TreasuryAssetApproved`.
    *   `ParameterChanged` (for governance settings).
    *   `Paused`, `Unpaused`.
    *   `EmergencyExecuted`.

3.  **Modifiers:**
    *   `onlyRole`: Restricts function access to accounts with a specific role.
    *   `onlyMember`: Restricts function access to registered members.
    *   `whenNotPaused`: Prevents execution when the contract is paused.
    *   `whenPaused`: Allows execution *only* when the contract is paused.
    *   `proposalExists`: Checks if a proposal ID is valid.
    *   `proposalStateIs`: Checks if a proposal is in a specific state.

4.  **Enums:**
    *   `ProposalState`: Defines the lifecycle of a proposal (Pending, Active, Succeeded, Failed, Executed, Canceled).

5.  **Structs:**
    *   `Proposal`: Stores all details related to a proposal (title, description, proposer, creation block, vote duration, target, signature, calldata, value, state, vote counts, minimum contribution required).

6.  **Functions:**

    *   **Membership & Roles (5 functions):**
        *   `addMember(address _account)`: Adds a new member to the DAO.
        *   `removeMember(address _account)`: Removes an existing member from the DAO.
        *   `grantRole(bytes32 _role, address _account)`: Grants a specific role to an account.
        *   `revokeRole(bytes32 _role, address _account)`: Revokes a specific role from an account.
        *   `updateContributionScore(address _account, int256 _scoreDelta)`: Adjusts a member's contribution score.

    *   **Voting Power & Delegation (3 functions):**
        *   `delegate(address _delegatee)`: Delegates voting power to another member.
        *   `undelegate()`: Removes current delegation.
        *   `getVotingPower(address _account)`: Calculates an account's current effective voting power (combines self-score and delegated scores). *View function.*

    *   **Proposals (6 functions):**
        *   `submitProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, address _target, bytes memory _calldata, uint256 _value, uint256 _voteDurationBlocks, uint256 _minContributionRequired)`: Submits a new proposal requiring a certain minimum contribution score to vote. Includes arbitrary call data for execution.
        *   `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Casts a vote (Yes/No) on an active proposal. Checks contribution score.
        *   `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Cancels a pending or active proposal (e.g., by proposer or role).
        *   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a succeeded proposal.
        *   `getProposalState(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal. *View function.*
        *   `getProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the full details of a proposal. *View function.*

    *   **Treasury Management (3 functions):**
        *   `deposit()`: Allows anyone to deposit Ether into the DAO treasury.
        *   `approveTreasuryAsset(address _token)`: Adds an ERC20 token address to the list of assets the DAO treasury can manage (requires governance).
        *   `getTreasuryBalance(address _token)`: Returns the balance of a specific ERC20 token or Ether held by the contract. *View function.*

    *   **Configuration & Governance (4 functions):**
        *   `setParameter(bytes32 _parameter, uint256 _value)`: Sets core governance parameters (e.g., proposal threshold, quorum, min contribution) via successful proposal execution.
        *   `setEmergencyCouncil(address[] memory _council)`: Sets the addresses of the emergency council via governance.
        *   `isApprovedTreasuryAsset(address _token)`: Checks if a token is an approved treasury asset. *View function.*
        *   `getParameter(bytes32 _parameter)`: Gets the value of a core governance parameter. *View function.*

    *   **Emergency & Safety (3 functions):**
        *   `pause()`: Pauses sensitive DAO operations (e.g., proposals, voting, execution). Requires specific role.
        *   `unpause()`: Unpauses DAO operations. Requires specific role.
        *   `emergencyExecute(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the emergency council to bypass voting and immediately execute a *pending* or *active* proposal under critical circumstances.

    *   **Internal Helpers (for clarity, not exposed publicly usually):**
        *   `_calculateVotingPower(address _account)`: Calculates an account's voting power including delegation.
        *   `_getCurrentBlockNumber()`: Gets the current blockchain block number.

Total Public/External Functions: 5 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 3 = **24 functions**. This meets the requirement of at least 20 functions.

        // This function is called when a delegator's score changes or a delegation changes.

        // 1. The delegator themselves (if they delegate to self / haven't delegated)
        // 2. The delegatee (if the delegator delegated to someone else)

        // This specific function signature (_delegatee, _delegator, _delegatorPositiveScore) is confusing with the revised model.
        // Let's rethink the update trigger.
        // 1. When contributionScores[_account] changes: Find delegates[_account]. If it's address(0) or _account, update _votingPower[_account]. If it's `delegatee`, update _votingPower[delegatee].
        // 2. When delegates[_account] changes: Find oldDelegatee. Find newDelegatee. Recalculate power contribution of _account. Remove from oldDelegatee, add to newDelegatee.

        // Simpler approach: getVotingPower(address) calculates on the fly. This is inefficient for many delegates.
        // Or, _votingPower[address] stores the aggregated value. We need a way to update it correctly.

        // Let's use the aggregated value approach, but the update logic needs to be more precise.
        // We need to know the *old* contribution of the delegator to subtract before adding the *new*.

        // Let's rename and clarify: _recalculateDelegateeVotingPower(address _delegatee)

        // Alternative: The initial _votingPower mapping idea was better.
        // `_votingPower[delegatee]` = Sum of positive scores of {delegatee} + {all members delegating to delegatee}.
        // When score of `account` changes:

        //   uint256 positiveScore = uint256(contributionScores[_account] > 0 ? uint256(contributionScores[_account]) : 0);
        //   if (_isMember[oldD]) _votingPower[oldD] -= positiveScore; // Subtract from old

    // --- Potential Advanced Concepts Added (Beyond Basic Voting) ---
    // 1. Role-Based Access Control (custom implementation).
    // 2. Contribution Score influencing voting power.
    // 3. Delegation of voting power.
    // 4. Dynamic Proposals with arbitrary contract calls (`target`, `calldata`, `value`).
    // 5. Treasury management (deposit, approved assets, transfers *via proposals*).
    // 6. Governable parameters (`setParameter`).
    // 7. Emergency pause/unpause mechanism.
    // 8. Emergency execution bypass for critical situations.
    // 9. Minimum contribution score required *per proposal* to vote.
    // 10. Consideration of total voting power for quorum (though complex state update needed).

    // Note on `totalDAOVotingPower`: A production contract would need a robust way
    // to calculate or track the total effective voting power across all members
    // (sum of `_votingPower` for all members) to implement quorum correctly.
    // This adds significant complexity to `addMember`, `removeMember`, `updateContributionScore`, and `delegate`
    // to update this sum efficiently without loops. A simple approach is to sum up
    // `_votingPower[member]` for all members, but this is O(memberCount).
    // For this example contract exceeding 20 functions, we acknowledge this missing piece
    // for a fully accurate quorum calculation but provide the structure assuming it exists.
    // The current quorum check in `executeProposal` is using a placeholder `totalDAOVotingPower`.
    // A real implementation would need to maintain `totalDAOVotingPower` in state
    // and update it whenever individual voting power (_votingPower mapping) changes.
