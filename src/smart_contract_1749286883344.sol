Okay, let's design a smart contract that goes beyond standard patterns. We'll create a "ChronoVault" â€“ a contract that holds various assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) and releases them based on complex, *composable* conditions, including time, block number, external data (simulated via oracles), and internal contract state.

This concept incorporates:
1.  **Multi-Asset Handling:** Managing ETH, multiple ERC20s, and multiple ERC721s.
2.  **Complex Conditional Release:** Using flexible "AND" and "OR" logic for unlock triggers.
3.  **Time/Block Triggers:** Standard time-based releases.
4.  **Data Oracles (Simulated):** Using external data feeds (like price) as unlock conditions.
5.  **State-Based Triggers:** Unlocking based on internal contract state (e.g., number of entries created).
6.  **Modular Conditions:** Conditions are data structures that can be combined.
7.  **Dynamic Schedule Modification:** Owner can add *more* conditions or groups to *existing* schedules (before they are unlocked).
8.  **Batch Operations:** Claiming multiple eligible entries at once.

Here's the outline and the Solidity code:

/*
 * OUTLINE & FUNCTION SUMMARY:
 *
 * ChronoVault: A multi-asset vault allowing conditional release based on composable triggers.
 * Assets handled: ETH, ERC20, ERC721.
 * Unlock conditions can be combined using OR (across ConditionGroups) and AND (within a ConditionGroup).
 * Condition types include: Timestamp, Block Number, External Price (via Oracle), Contract State, Manual Trigger.
 *
 * State Variables:
 * - vaultEntries: Mapping from unique ID to VaultEntry struct. Stores all details of each locked asset.
 * - claimed: Mapping from unique ID to boolean. Tracks if an entry has been claimed.
 * - nextVaultId: Counter for unique entry IDs.
 * - oracleAddresses: Mapping from bytes32 key (e.g., keccak256("ETH/USD")) to IPriceFeed contract address.
 *
 * Enums:
 * - AssetType: Differentiates between ETH, ERC20, ERC721.
 * - ConditionType: Defines the type of trigger (Timestamp, Block, Price, State, Manual).
 *
 * Structs:
 * - Condition: Represents a single trigger (type, target value, associated data like oracle key).
 * - ConditionGroup: An array of Conditions. All conditions in this group must be true to unlock.
 * - UnlockSchedule: An array of ConditionGroups. If ANY group is true, the schedule is met.
 * - VaultEntry: Full details of a locked asset (beneficiary, asset info, amount/id, unlock schedule).
 *
 * Events:
 * - VaultEntryCreated: Logs creation of a new entry.
 * - AssetsUnlocked: Logs when a vault entry's conditions are met.
 * - AssetsClaimed: Logs when assets are successfully claimed.
 * - VaultEntryCancelled: Logs cancellation of an entry.
 * - OracleAddressSet: Logs when an oracle address is configured.
 * - ConditionGroupAdded: Logs when a new condition group is added to an entry.
 * - ConditionAdded: Logs when a new condition is added to a group.
 *
 * Modifiers:
 * - onlyBeneficiaryOrOwner: Allows execution only by the beneficiary or contract owner.
 * - isVaultEntryActive: Ensures a vault entry exists and is not yet claimed.
 *
 * Functions (29+):
 *
 * Core Logic (Internal/Private helpers):
 * - _evaluateCondition(Condition calldata _condition): Checks a single condition's state.
 * - _evaluatePriceCondition(bytes32 _oracleKey, int256 _targetPrice): Checks an oracle price condition.
 * - _evaluateConditionGroup(ConditionGroup calldata _group): Checks if all conditions in a group are met.
 * - _evaluateUnlockSchedule(UnlockSchedule calldata _schedule): Checks if any condition group in a schedule is met.
 * - _transferAsset(VaultEntry storage _entry, address _to): Handles asset transfer based on type.
 * - _createVaultEntry(address _beneficiary, AssetType _assetType, address _assetAddress, uint256 _amountOrTokenId, UnlockSchedule calldata _schedule): Internal helper to create and store a vault entry.
 *
 * Deposit Functions (Owner or approved depositor):
 * - depositEth(address _beneficiary, UnlockSchedule calldata _schedule): Creates a vault entry for deposited ETH.
 * - depositERC20(address _beneficiary, IERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, UnlockSchedule calldata _schedule): Creates a vault entry for deposited ERC20 tokens (requires prior approval).
 * - depositERC721(address _beneficiary, IERC721 _token, uint256 _tokenId, UnlockSchedule calldata _schedule): Creates a vault entry for deposited ERC721 token (requires prior approval).
 *
 * Configuration & Management (Owner only):
 * - setOracleAddress(bytes32 _oracleKey, address _oracleAddress): Configures an oracle contract address for a given key.
 * - addConditionGroupToEntry(uint256 _vaultId, ConditionGroup calldata _newGroup): Adds a new condition group to an existing entry's schedule (only if not yet unlocked).
 * - addConditionToGroup(uint256 _vaultId, uint256 _groupIndex, Condition calldata _newCondition): Adds a condition to a specific group in an entry's schedule (only if not yet unlocked).
 * - cancelVaultEntry(uint256 _vaultId): Cancels an entry and returns assets to owner (only if not yet unlocked).
 * - transferOwnership(address newOwner): Transfers contract ownership (from Ownable).
 * - withdrawExcessEth(): Allows owner to withdraw accidental ETH deposits not part of a vault entry.
 * - withdrawExcessERC20(IERC20 _token): Allows owner to withdraw accidental ERC20 deposits.
 * - withdrawExcessERC721(IERC721 _token, uint256 _tokenId): Allows owner to withdraw accidental ERC721 token deposits.
 *
 * Claiming Functions (Beneficiary):
 * - claimAssets(uint256 _vaultId): Allows beneficiary to claim assets for a specific, unlocked entry.
 * - claimBatchAssets(uint256[] calldata _vaultIds): Allows beneficiary to claim assets for multiple specific, unlocked entries.
 * - claimAllEligibleAssets(): Allows beneficiary to claim all their unlocked and unclaimed assets.
 *
 * View Functions (Anyone can call):
 * - getVaultEntryCount(): Returns the total number of vault entries created.
 * - getVaultEntryDetails(uint256 _vaultId): Returns details of a specific vault entry (excluding asset type-specific data in struct).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Composable Conditions (`UnlockSchedule`, `ConditionGroup`, `Condition` structs):**
    *   Instead of simple time locks, unlock logic is built from individual `Condition` units.
    *   `ConditionGroup` uses "AND" logic: *all* conditions within a group must be true.
    *   `UnlockSchedule` uses "OR" logic: if *any* `ConditionGroup` is true, the asset is unlocked.
    *   This allows complex rules like: `(Timestamp >= X AND Price >= Y) OR (Block >= Z)`.

2.  **Multiple Asset Types:** The contract explicitly handles Ether, ERC20, and ERC721 within the same vault structure, abstracting the transfer logic in `_transferAsset`.

3.  **External Data Integration (Simulated Oracles):** The `Price` `ConditionType` allows linking unlock criteria to external data feeds. While the `IPriceFeed` is a simple mock interface, it demonstrates how you'd integrate with real oracle networks like Chainlink by requiring the owner to set the oracle contract address (`setOracleAddress`).

4.  **State-Based Conditions:** The `State_VaultCountGE` `ConditionType` allows unlocking assets based on the contract's own state (in this case, the total number of vault entries created). This could be extended to other state variables.

5.  **Dynamic Schedule Modification (Owner only):** `addConditionGroupToEntry` and `addConditionToGroup` allow the owner to add *more* conditions or groups to an entry *after* it's created, provided it hasn't already been unlocked. This enables adapting schedules if circumstances change, though it cannot remove or weaken existing conditions for security/trust reasons (a more complex version could allow proposals and beneficiary approval for changes).

6.  **Batch Claiming:** `claimBatchAssets` and `claimAllEligibleAssets` provide gas-efficient ways for beneficiaries to claim multiple unlocked entries in a single transaction. `claimAllEligibleAssets` specifically uses a mapping (`beneficiaryVaults`) to quickly find relevant entries for a user, avoiding iterating the entire contract state (which would be prohibitive).

7.  **ERC721Holder:** Inheriting `ERC721Holder` ensures the contract can safely receive ERC721 tokens.

8.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Used on transfer functions (`_transferAsset`, `claimAssets`, `claimBatchAssets`, `claimAllEligibleAssets`, `withdrawExcessEth`) to prevent malicious reentrant calls during asset transfers.

9.  **Owner-Only Deposits/Management:** Deposits and schedule modifications are restricted to the `Ownable` owner for security and control.

10. **Manual Trigger Condition:** The `Manual` condition type allows the owner to act as an external trigger by calling `setManualTriggerState` for a specific key, which can unlock entries waiting on that specific manual flag.

11. **Excess Asset Withdrawal:** Functions like `withdrawExcessEth` and `withdrawExcessERC20`/`withdrawExcessERC721` allow the owner to recover any assets accidentally sent to the contract address that weren't part of a formal `deposit` function call.

12. **Comprehensive View Functions:** A variety of view functions (`getVaultEntryDetails`, `getScheduleForEntry`, `checkVaultEntryStatus`, `getEligibleVaultEntries`, etc.) provide detailed insights into the state of individual vaults, schedules, and overall contract status.

13. **Gas Efficiency Considerations:** The use of the `beneficiaryVaults` mapping and the `activeVaultCount` counter are specific optimizations to avoid expensive iterations in key view and claim functions. The use of `calldata` for complex struct inputs in external functions is also a gas-saving pattern.

14. **NatSpec Comments:** Added comprehensive documentation comments for better understanding.

This `ChronoVault` contract provides a flexible framework for managing assets based on complex, programmable rules, demonstrating several advanced Solidity patterns and concepts beyond typical examples.
