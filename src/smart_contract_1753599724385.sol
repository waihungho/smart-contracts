This smart contract, `AetheriumCognito`, designs a novel decentralized autonomous policy engine that integrates a simulated on-chain collective intelligence model, a wisdom-based reputation system, and dynamic NFTs. It's intended to be an "adaptive DAO" where decisions are influenced by human input and an evolving, on-chain "AI" component.

**Disclaimer:** This is a conceptual contract for educational and creative purposes. The "AI" is a simulated, deterministic model based on aggregated on-chain data and simple algorithms, not a true off-chain AI. Deployment and gas costs for highly dynamic or data-intensive operations on a real blockchain might be significant. Thorough security audits and robust economic modeling would be required for any production use.

---

## Outline:

**I. Core System & Configuration**
*   Initialization, epoch management, system pausing, fee withdrawal.

**II. Insight & Data Submission**
*   Mechanisms for users to submit data points or observations (`Insights`) that feed into the "Cognito" model, and for the community/DAO to validate them.

**III. On-Chain Model Simulation & Prediction (The "Cognito" Engine)**
*   The core "intelligence" of the protocol. A simplified, deterministic algorithm that generates numerical predictions/recommendations based on historical validated insights and adjustable parameters.

**IV. Wisdom Score & Token Mechanics**
*   A reputation system where users earn "Wisdom Scores" based on their contributions and accuracy. Integrates with an ERC20 "Wisdom Token" (WSDM) for rewards.

**V. Epoch Management & Model Evolution**
*   The crucial function that advances the system through epochs, evaluates the model's past performance, algorithmically adjusts its parameters, updates user wisdom scores, and distributes WSDM rewards.

**VI. Dynamic NFT (Synergy Agent) Evolution**
*   ERC721 NFTs that can visually or functionally evolve based on their owner's Wisdom Score and interaction with the protocol.

**VII. Decentralized Decision Making (Influence & Governance)**
*   A proposal and voting system where vote weight is influenced by Wisdom Score, and the Cognito model's recommendation is provided as an additional input for voters.

**VIII. Security & Access Control**
*   Standard ownership and pausing mechanisms for contract safety.

## Function Summary:

1.  **`constructor(address _wsdmTokenAddress, address _synergyAgentNFTAddress)`**: Initializes the contract by setting up the owner, deploying WisdomToken (WSDM) and SynergyAgentNFT, and setting their ownership to this contract.
2.  **`updateEpochDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`**: Allows the owner to set the duration of each epoch, affecting how frequently the Cognito model evolves.
3.  **`pauseSystem()`**: Pauses certain contract functionalities (e.g., insight submission, voting), useful for emergencies. Only callable by the owner.
4.  **`unpauseSystem()`**: Unpauses the system, restoring full functionality. Only callable by the owner.
5.  **`withdrawProtocolFees(address _recipient)`**: Allows the owner to withdraw any accumulated protocol fees (e.g., from future integrations or specific operations not yet implemented) to a specified address.
6.  **`submitInsight(bytes32 _insightHash, uint256 _insightValue, uint256 _targetEpoch)`**: Users can submit a hashed representation of external data (`_insightHash`) along with a numerical interpretation (`_insightValue`) that is relevant for a specified future epoch. This feeds the "Cognito" model.
7.  **`validateInsight(uint256 _insightId, bool _isValid)`**: Enables community members with a Wisdom Score to vote on the validity of a submitted insight. This influences the insight's contribution to the model's training.
8.  **`revokeInsight(uint256 _insightId)`**: Allows the original submitter of an insight to revoke it, preventing it from being used in model training, if it hasn't been validated already.
9.  **`getInsight(uint256 _insightId)`**: Retrieves all details for a specific insight, including its submitter, value, target epoch, and validation status.
10. **`getCognitoPrediction(uint256 _epoch)`**: Returns the "Cognito" model's current numerical prediction or recommendation for a specified epoch. For past epochs, it returns the determined "actual" value.
11. **`getPredictionModelParameters()`**: Retrieves the current hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, bias weight) of the Cognito prediction model, showing how it's configured to learn.
12. **`adjustModelHyperparameters(uint256 _newLearningRate, uint256 _newBiasWeight)`**: Allows the owner/DAO to fine-tune the learning rate and bias weight of the Cognito model, influencing its adaptability.
13. **`getWisdomScore(address _user)`**: Retrieves the current Wisdom Score of any given user, reflecting their reputation and influence within the protocol.
14. **`claimWisdomRewards()`**: Allows users to claim accumulated WSDM tokens, which are awarded based on their insights' accuracy and contributions during epoch advancements.
15. **`advanceEpochAndTrainModel()`**: The core function to progress the system to the next epoch. It evaluates the previous epoch's insights against the model's prediction, updates the Cognito model's parameters algorithmically (simulated AI training), adjusts users' Wisdom Scores based on insight accuracy, and queues WSDM rewards. Callable by anyone to trigger if the epoch duration has passed.
16. **`mintSynergyAgentNFT(string memory _tokenURI)`**: Mints a new SynergyAgent NFT for the caller. This NFT can dynamically evolve based on the owner's Wisdom Score or protocol events.
17. **`getAgentTrait(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _traitIndex)`**: Retrieves a specific trait value of a SynergyAgent NFT, reflecting its current evolved state.
18. **`proposeDecision(string memory _description, bytes memory _targetCalldata, address _targetAddress, uint256 _minWisdomToVote)`**: Allows users (who meet a minimum Wisdom Score) to propose on-chain actions or changes, including the target contract and calldata for execution.
19. **`voteOnDecision(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: Users can vote on a decision proposal. Their vote weight is directly influenced by their current Wisdom Score and potentially staked WSDM tokens.
20. **`executeDecision(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes a passed decision proposal if its voting period has ended and it has met the necessary quorum and majority requirements based on wisdom-weighted votes.
21. **`getCognitoRecommendationForProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Provides the Cognito model's general numerical "stance" or recommendation relevant to a specific proposal at the time it was proposed, serving as an additional data point for voters.
22. **`getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Retrieves comprehensive details about a specific decision proposal, including its current vote counts, status, and target.
23. **`transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`**: Standard OpenZeppelin Ownable function to transfer the administrative ownership of the contract.
24. **`renounceOwnership()`**: Standard OpenZeppelin Ownable function to renounce contract ownership, typically making the contract immutable or controlled by a DAO.
25. **`setMinWisdomToPropose(uint256 _minScore)`**: Sets the minimum Wisdom Score required for users to be able to submit a new decision proposal.
26. **`setValidationQuorum(uint256 _quorumPercentage)`**: Sets the percentage of total wisdom score required for an insight to be considered officially validated for model training.
27. **`setWSDMRewardPerInsight(uint256 _amount)`**: Sets the amount of WSDM tokens rewarded for each successfully validated and impactful insight submitted by a user.
