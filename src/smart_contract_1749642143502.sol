Okay, let's design a smart contract that combines a decentralized marketplace with a governance mechanism, a reputation system, and a simple staking component. This covers marketplace logic, token interaction, DAO concepts, and novel rating/dispute features, aiming for complexity and uniqueness.

We'll call it `DecentralizedAutonomousMarketplace`.

**Core Concepts:**

1.  **Marketplace:** Users can list and buy ERC721 NFTs using ETH or a supported ERC20 token. Supports fixed-price listings and offers.
2.  **Staking:** Users can stake the protocol's native ERC20 token (`DAMToken`) to gain voting power and potentially participate in dispute resolution or earn fee shares (though we'll focus on governance/disputes for function count).
3.  **Governance:** Stakers can propose and vote on changes to marketplace parameters (fees, supported tokens).
4.  **Reputation System:** Users can rate each other after successful trades, contributing to a public, on-chain reputation score. This score could influence listing visibility or fees in a more advanced version (we'll focus on score calculation).
5.  **Dispute Resolution:** A basic on-chain mechanism where stakers can vote to resolve disputes related to transactions (requires a staked amount to initiate/participate).

        // Distribute remaining stake pool among winning voters (simplified)
        // This is complex to do gas-efficiently on-chain for many voters.
        // A real system might use a claim mechanism or distribute to a pool.
        // Here, we just acknowledge the pool exists after handling initiator stake.
        // The remaining totalStakeToDistribute amount stays in protocolFees[_damToken] for now.
        // A more advanced system would iterate through voters, check their vote vs outcome,
        // calculate their share of the remaining pool based on their staked balance * voting power,
        // and potentially transfer tokens or log claims.

        // For this example, we'll just log the remaining pool and acknowledge the complexity.
        // The tokens are effectively transferred to the protocol treasury if initiator loses.
        // If initiator wins, only non-initiator voters who lost effectively lose their stake.
        // Need a way to identify individual voter stakes in the pool and their votes.
        // This requires storing dispute participant votes individually or using a more complex voting system.

        // Let's simplify: All participant stakes (excluding potentially slashed initiator stake)
        // remain in the protocolFees[_damToken]. A separate claim function or
        // automated distribution mechanism would be needed.

        // Log that distribution needs to happen off-chain or via another call
         emit DisputeParticipantRewarded(disputeId, address(0), totalStakeToDistribute); // 0 address signifies the pool

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Function Count:**

1.  **Integrated Modules:** Combines a standard marketplace (`listFixedPriceItem`, `buyItem`, `cancelListing`, `makeOffer`, `acceptOffer`, `rejectOffer`, `cancelOffer`) with staking (`stake`, `unstake`), governance (`createParameterChangeProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, `executeProposal`), reputation (`submitRating`), and dispute resolution (`startDispute`, `voteOnDispute`, `resolveDispute`). This modularity within one contract is a common advanced pattern.
2.  **On-Chain Reputation:** `submitRating` and `getReputation` provide a basic, transparent reputation score based on confirmed transactions (conceptually). This is less common in simple marketplaces and adds a social/trust layer.
3.  **DAO Governance:** `createParameterChangeProposal`, `voteOnProposal`, and `executeProposal` implement a simple token-weighted voting system where stakers can propose and enact changes to contract parameters (`_setMarketplaceFeeBps`, etc.). This makes the marketplace autonomous and governed by its users/stakers.
4.  **Staked Dispute Resolution:** `startDispute`, `voteOnDispute`, and `resolveDispute` introduce a mechanism where stakers (those with sufficient stake) can act as decentralized jurors. Requiring a stake (`_disputeStakeAmount`) to initiate and vote adds a cost to participation, incentivizing genuine involvement and potentially penalizing frivolous disputes or malicious voting. The stake distribution (`resolveDispute`) adds another layer of complexity.
5.  **Offers on Unlisted Items:** The `makeOffer` function supports offers on items *not* currently listed, allowing for direct negotiation outside the fixed-price flow.
6.  **Flexible Payment:** Supports both native currency (ETH) and a specified ERC20 token for listing fees and pricing.
7.  **Extensive View Functions:** A large number of `view` functions (`getUserStake`, `getTotalStaked`, `getProposalState`, `getProposalDetails`, `getUserProposalVote`, `getReputation`, `getRatingCount`, `getDisputeState`, `getDisputeDetails`, `getUserDisputeVote`, `getDisputeParticipantCount`, `getListing`, `getOffer`, `getMarketplaceFee`, `getListingFee`, `getSupportedListingFeeToken`, `getSupportedNFTContract`) provide transparency and easy access to the state of the various systems, contributing significantly to the >20 function count.
8.  **Internal Governance Targets:** Using internal functions (`_setMarketplaceFeeBps`, etc.) called via `address(this).call` from `executeProposal` is a pattern seen in some complex DAOs, although it requires very careful encoding of `callData` and security audits.

This contract goes beyond a simple buy/sell marketplace by integrating governance, reputation, and dispute resolution powered by staking, providing a more complex and autonomous ecosystem on-chain. The combination of these features is less common than simple exchanges or NFT minting contracts.

**Important Considerations for Production:**

*   **Security:** The `executeProposal` function is powerful and dangerous if `callData` isn't strictly validated. A real DAO might use a separate timelocked executor contract or a stricter proposal type system. The dispute resolution and stake distribution logic is highly simplified and needs careful design for fairness and gas efficiency.
*   **Gas Costs:** Complex transactions (like `buyItem` with token transfers, or dispute resolution) can be expensive.
*   **Off-Chain Data:** Dispute evidence or detailed rating comments (`comment` field in `submitRating`) typically live off-chain (e.g., IPFS), with only a hash stored on-chain.
*   **Dispute Mechanism Complexity:** A robust dispute system needs clear rules, evidence submission (off-chain), potentially a random selection of jurors from the staker pool, and secure execution of dispute outcomes (e.g., refunding funds held in escrow, transferring NFTs back). The implemented version is a conceptual framework.
*   **Scalability:** Storing all offers, listings, votes, and disputes on-chain can become expensive and hit block gas limits for retrieval over time. Events are crucial for indexing off-chain.
*   **Upgradability:** This contract is not designed to be upgradable. Production contracts often use proxy patterns.
*   **ERC20/ERC721 Standards:** Assumes standard external contracts. Real interaction needs `SafeERC20` for robustness against non-standard tokens.

This contract meets the requirements by integrating multiple advanced concepts (DAO governance, staked dispute resolution, on-chain reputation) into a marketplace context, resulting in well over 20 functions and a unique combination of features not typically found together in basic open-source examples.
