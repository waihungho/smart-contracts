/**
 * @title Decentralized Trustless Reputation Oracle (DTRO)
 * @author Your Name (Replace with your name)
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized reputation system using a quadratic voting mechanism
 *         and a Merkle root commitment scheme to ensure tamper-proof reputation data.
 *         It allows users to assess the reputation of addresses based on specific topics or skills.
 *         The contract leverages on-chain voting, Merkle tree storage, and a reputation token to incentivize
 *         honest voting and disincentivize malicious behavior.
 *
 *  **Outline:**
 *  1.  **Reputation Token (RepToken):** ERC20 token used to incentivize voting.
 *  2.  **Merkle Tree Storage:** Stores reputation data as leaves in a Merkle tree, with the root stored on-chain.
 *  3.  **Voting Mechanism:** Quadratic voting mechanism to aggregate reputation scores.
 *  4.  **Reputation Scoring:** Calculates reputation scores based on voting results and stake weighted by RepToken holdings.
 *  5.  **Topic Management:** Allows creation and management of reputation topics.
 *  6.  **Claim Resolution (Potential Future Enhancement):** Handles disputes and inconsistencies in reputation reports.
 *  7.  **Slash Mechanism:** Implements a slashing mechanism for malicious voters (Future enhancement).
 *
 *  **Function Summary:**
 *  - **constructor():** Initializes the contract, deploying the Reputation Token.
 *  - **createTopic(string memory _topicName, string memory _topicDescription):** Creates a new reputation topic.
 *  - **vote(uint256 _topicId, address _targetAddress, int256 _voteValue):**  Registers a vote for a target address within a specific topic. Uses quadratic voting.
 *  - **commitMerkleRoot(uint256 _topicId, bytes32 _merkleRoot):** Commits the Merkle root of the reputation data for a topic.
 *  - **verifyReputation(uint256 _topicId, address _targetAddress, bytes32[] memory _proof, bytes32 _leaf, bytes32 _merkleRoot):** Verifies the reputation of an address for a topic based on a Merkle proof.
 *  - **getTopic(uint256 _topicId):** Retrieves information about a specific topic.
 *  - **getReputationScore(uint256 _topicId, address _targetAddress):** Retrieves the reputation score of an address for a topic.
 *  - **getRepTokenAddress():** Returns the address of the Reputation Token contract.
 *
 *  **Security Considerations:**
 *  - Reentrancy:  Vote function must be protected against reentrancy attacks when interacting with the RepToken.
 *  - Overflow/Underflow: Use SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ to prevent integer overflows/underflows.
 *  - Access Control:  Appropriate access control should be implemented for admin functions.
 *  - Data Integrity: Merkle tree root commitment ensures data integrity and prevents tampering.
 *  - Sybil Resistance: Quadratic voting helps mitigate Sybil attacks.
 *  - Front-running: Consider mitigation strategies for potential front-running in the vote function.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a concise overview of the contract's purpose, architecture, and functions.  This is critical for understanding and auditing.
* **Quadratic Voting:** The `vote` function now implements quadratic voting, where the cost to vote increases quadratically with the vote value. This helps to mitigate Sybil attacks and ensures that votes from multiple accounts aren't disproportionately influential.  The square root of the vote value is deducted from the voter's RepToken balance using `SafeMath.sqrt(uint256(abs(_voteValue)))`.
* **Merkle Root Commitment:** The contract uses a Merkle tree commitment scheme to ensure the integrity of the reputation data.  The `commitMerkleRoot` function allows an oracle to publish the Merkle root of the reputation data for a given topic. The `verifyReputation` function allows anyone to verify that a specific reputation score is part of the Merkle tree.
* **Reputation Token (RepToken):**  An ERC20 token is used to incentivize voting and reward users for contributing to the reputation system.  The `vote` function now requires users to spend RepToken to cast votes, helping to prevent spam and incentivize honest voting.  The voting cost (the square root of the vote value) is deducted from the voter's balance and transferred to the contract. This allows the contract to hold funds for potentially paying out rewards to honest voters or slashing malicious voters (future feature).
* **Topic Management:** The `createTopic` function allows the contract owner to create new reputation topics.  Each topic has a name, description, and a Merkle root.
* **SafeMath:**  Using OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` library for arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflows/underflows in Solidity versions before 0.8.0.  Using Solidity 0.8+ is recommended for automatic overflow/underflow checks.
* **Access Control:** The `Ownable` contract from OpenZeppelin is used to manage ownership of the contract. The `createTopic` and `commitMerkleRoot` functions are restricted to the owner.
* **Reentrancy Protection:**  The `ReentrancyGuard` contract from OpenZeppelin is used to protect against reentrancy attacks.  The `vote` function is marked as `nonReentrant`.
* **Events:**  Events are emitted to provide a transparent record of important actions that occur on the contract, such as topic creation, vote casting, and Merkle root commitment.
* **Clear Error Messages:**  `require` statements include descriptive error messages to help users understand why a transaction failed.
* **Security Considerations:** A section on security considerations is included to highlight potential vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
* **Merkle Proof Verification Example:** Includes a simple example of how to verify a Merkle proof directly in Solidity.  Using an external, well-audited library for Merkle tree operations is highly recommended in a production environment.
* **Abs Function:**  Includes an `abs()` helper function for taking the absolute value of an `int256`.  Solidity doesn't have a built-in `abs()` function for signed integers.
* **ERC20 import:** Added the necessary import statement.
* **Topic isActive:** Added an `isActive` flag to the `Topic` struct and `require` checks to ensure votes and commits can't happen on inactive topics.
* **`transferFrom` instead of `transfer`:** Using `transferFrom` requires users to *approve* the contract to spend their tokens before voting.  This is the generally preferred approach for security.
* **Comprehensive Comments:**  Extensive comments are included to explain the code and its functionality.

This improved version provides a more robust and secure foundation for a decentralized reputation system.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider using established Merkle tree libraries for better security and efficiency.
