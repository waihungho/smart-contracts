 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art collective, incorporating advanced concepts
 *      such as dynamic NFT traits, on-chain exhibitions, reputation-based governance, and collaborative artwork creation.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Membership Management:**
 *    - `joinCollective(string _artistName, string _bio)`: Allows users to join the collective by paying a membership fee and providing artist information.
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective and potentially withdraw a portion of their contribution.
 *    - `updateArtistProfile(string _newName, string _newBio)`: Allows members to update their artist name and bio.
 *    - `getMemberProfile(address _member) view returns (string name, string bio, uint256 joinTimestamp, uint256 reputation)`: Retrieves a member's profile information.
 *    - `isMember(address _account) view returns (bool)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 *
 * **2. Artwork Submission and Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Members can submit their artwork proposals to the collective.
 *    - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote to approve or reject submitted artwork proposals.
 *    - `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an NFT for an approved artwork, transferring ownership to the submitting artist.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId) view returns (string title, string description, string ipfsHash, address artist, uint256 approvalVotes, uint256 rejectionVotes, bool isApproved, bool isMinted)`: Retrieves details about a specific artwork proposal.
 *    - `getApprovedArtworkIds() view returns (uint256[])`: Returns a list of IDs of approved artworks.
 *
 * **3. On-Chain Exhibition Management:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, uint256[] _artworkIds, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Proposes the creation of an on-chain exhibition with selected artworks and a time frame.
 *    - `voteOnExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _approve)`: Members vote to approve or reject exhibition proposals.
 *    - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`:  Starts an approved exhibition (can only be called after approval and at the start time).
 *    - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Ends an active exhibition (can only be called after the end time).
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId) view returns (string name, uint256[] artworkIds, uint256 startTime, uint256 endTime, bool isApproved, bool isActive, uint256 approvalVotes, uint256 rejectionVotes)`: Retrieves details about a specific exhibition.
 *    - `getActiveExhibitionIds() view returns (uint256[])`: Returns a list of IDs of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **4. Reputation and Governance:**
 *    - `increaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner or designated roles to increase a member's reputation (e.g., for contributions).
 *    - `decreaseReputation(address _member, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner or designated roles to decrease a member's reputation (e.g., for misconduct).
 *    - `updateMembershipFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Allows the contract owner to update the membership fee.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Allows the contract owner to set the voting duration for proposals.
 *    - `setArtworkApprovalThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: Allows the contract owner to set the artwork approval threshold.
 *
 * **5. Collaborative Artwork Feature (Example - Dynamic Trait):**
 *    - `contributeToArtworkTrait(uint256 _artworkId, bytes32 _traitName, bytes32 _traitValue)`: Members can contribute to dynamic traits of approved artworks, influencing their evolution (example: color palette, texture style based on collective input).
 *    - `getArtworkDynamicTraits(uint256 _artworkId) view returns (bytes32[] traitNames, bytes32[] traitValues)`: Retrieves the dynamic traits of an artwork.
