/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation System (DRS) with Quadratic Funding and Temporal Decay
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized reputation system where users can earn reputation points 
 *         by participating in tasks or contributing to the community. Reputation points are used to vote 
 *         on proposals. The voting power of each user is quadratically weighted based on their reputation,
 *         mitigating whale influence.  Reputation decays over time, encouraging continuous engagement.  The contract 
 *         also includes a basic quadratic funding mechanism to allocate funds proportionally to the reputation 
 *         earned by different project owners.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1.  Reputation Management:
 *     -   `mintReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`:  Mints reputation tokens for a user.
 *     -   `burnReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: Burns reputation tokens from a user.  Can be used for penalties.
 *     -   `getReputation(address _user)`: Returns the current reputation of a user, considering temporal decay.
 *     -   `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _decayRate)`:  Sets the decay rate for reputation points.
 *
 * 2.  Proposal Voting:
 *     -   `createProposal(string _title, string _description, uint256 _endTime)`: Creates a new proposal.
 *     -   `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _supports)`:  Votes on a proposal. Voting power is quadratically weighted by reputation.
 *     -   `getProposalResults(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Returns the results of a proposal, including total votes for and against,
 *         as well as the number of voters.
 *     -   `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Executes a proposal (only callable after the voting period).
 *
 * 3.  Quadratic Funding:
 *     -   `registerProject(string _projectName)`:  Registers a project that can receive quadratic funding.
 *     -   `donateToProject(uint256 _projectId)`: Allows users to donate to a specific project.
 *     -   `calculateMatchingFunds()`:  Calculates and distributes matching funds to project owners based on 
 *         the square root of donations received.
 *     -   `withdrawMatchingFunds(uint256 _projectId)`: Allows project owners to withdraw their allocated matching funds.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * -  Reputation Management: Mint, burn, get, and manage reputation points with temporal decay.
 * -  Proposal Voting: Create proposals, vote with quadratically weighted reputation, and get proposal results.
 * -  Quadratic Funding: Register projects, donate, calculate matching funds, and allow withdrawal of funds.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Documentation:**  Comprehensive NatSpec comments explaining each function, its purpose, parameters, return values, and potential security considerations. This is crucial for understanding and auditing the contract.  Added `@notice` and `@author` tags.
* **Reputation Decay:** Implements reputation decay to incentivize continuous engagement. The `getReputation` function now accounts for the time elapsed since the last reputation update and reduces the reputation accordingly.  The `reputationDecayRate` allows adjusting the decay speed.  Includes protection against `decayFactor` exceeding 100%, which would cause unexpected behavior.  Crucially, the `lastReputationUpdate` is updated *when* reputation is accessed, not just on minting.
* **Quadratic Voting:** The `vote` function now implements quadratic voting, where the voting power is the *square* of the user's reputation.  This reduces the influence of users with extremely high reputation.
* **Quadratic Funding:**  The quadratic funding section is now fully functional:
    * **`registerProject`:**  Registers projects to receive funding.
    * **`donateToProject`:** Allows users to donate to projects.
    * **`calculateMatchingFunds`:** Calculates and distributes matching funds based on the square root of donations.  Uses the Babylonian method for calculating the square root which avoid `Math` lib.
    * **`withdrawMatchingFunds`:** Allows project owners to withdraw their matching funds.
* **Matching Funds Pool:**  A `matchingFundsPool` is added to store the funds available for quadratic funding. The contract owner *must* fund this pool before matching funds can be calculated.  Functions to withdraw remaining funds are implemented.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors (e.g., insufficient reputation, invalid proposal ID, end time in the past).  More descriptive error messages are used.
* **Security:**
    * **Overflow/Underflow Prevention:**  Using Solidity 0.8.0+ automatically protects against integer overflow and underflow.
    * **Reentrancy Protection:**  The `withdrawMatchingFunds` function is protected against reentrancy attacks by updating the `matchingFunds` state variable *before* transferring the funds.
    * **Access Control:** The `mintReputation`, `burnReputation`, `setReputationDecayRate`, `calculateMatchingFunds` and fund/withdraw pools function are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
* **Events:**  Emits events to log important actions, making the contract auditable.
* **Gas Optimization:** While not heavily optimized, the code avoids obvious gas inefficiencies.  Uses `calldata` where appropriate. Uses memory for strings passed as arguments.
* **`receive()` Function:**  Added a `receive()` function to allow users to send ETH to the contract, which can be used to fund the `matchingFundsPool`.
* **Clear State Variables:**  State variables are declared with appropriate visibility (e.g., `public` for readable variables, `private` for internal variables).
* **`sqrt` function:**  Added a `sqrt` method to handle the square root calculation for quadratic funding.
* **Withdraw Pools:** Added functionality to withdraw donations or matchingFunds from pools by the owner.

**How to Deploy and Use:**

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the `DecentralizedReputation` contract to a suitable Ethereum environment (e.g., Ganache, Remix, a testnet, or mainnet).
2.  **Fund the `matchingFundsPool`:** Call the `fundMatchingFundsPool()` function with the amount of ETH you want to allocate for quadratic funding.  This is *essential* before calling `calculateMatchingFunds()`.
3.  **Mint Reputation:** Call the `mintReputation()` function to give users initial reputation points. Only the contract owner can do this.
4.  **Register Projects:**  Users call `registerProject()` to register their projects for quadratic funding.
5.  **Donate to Projects:**  Users call `donateToProject()` to donate ETH to specific projects.
6.  **Create Proposals:** Users call the `createProposal()` function to create new proposals.
7.  **Vote on Proposals:**  Users call the `vote()` function to vote on proposals, using their quadratically-weighted reputation.
8.  **Calculate Matching Funds:** Call `calculateMatchingFunds()` to distribute matching funds after a fundraising round.  Only the contract owner can do this.
9.  **Withdraw Matching Funds:** Project owners call `withdrawMatchingFunds()` to withdraw their allocated funds.
10. **Execute Proposals:** Call `executeProposal()` after a voting period to execute a proposal and trigger the associated logic. Only after the voting period ends and the proposal is not executed before.
11. **Withdraw Pool**: Withdraw donation or matchingFunds from pool if needed.

This is a much more robust and feature-rich implementation of a decentralized reputation and quadratic funding system. Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider using a more sophisticated quadratic funding calculation that incorporates collusion detection. You can adjust decay rate, project registration mechanism, and access control based on your specific requirements.
