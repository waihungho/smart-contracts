Okay, here is a smart contract in Solidity called `QuantumVault`.

This contract acts as a programmable vault capable of holding various asset types (Native Coin, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) and releasing them to multiple beneficiaries based on a set of complex, multi-part conditions. The conditions can include time-based locks, outcomes from Chainlink VRF (for secure randomness), or checks against the state of other smart contracts. The "Quantum" aspect comes from the potential use of randomness as an unlock condition, introducing an element of unpredictability or a "quantum state collapse" moment upon reveal.

It includes features like:
*   Support for multiple asset types in a single vault.
*   Multiple beneficiaries with configurable shares.
*   Multi-part unlock conditions (ALL conditions must be met).
*   Condition types: Timestamp, Chainlink VRF outcome, State of another contract.
*   Secure randomness integration via Chainlink VRF v2.
*   Delegated claiming rights.
*   Admin functions (ownership, pausing, stuck asset recovery).
*   Owner cancellation (before unlock/claims).
*   Owner emergency unlock (with a delay).

It avoids simply duplicating common patterns like basic timelocks, simple escrows, or standard token vaults by combining these elements with advanced features like multi-condition unlocks, VRF integration, and cross-contract state checks within a single, comprehensive vault system.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor`: Initializes the contract owner, pausing state, and Chainlink VRF parameters.
*   `createVault`: Creates a new vault with specified beneficiaries, shares, and initial status.
*   `depositERC20`: Deposits ERC20 tokens into a specific vault.
*   `depositERC721`: Deposits an ERC721 token into a specific vault.
*   `depositERC1155`: Deposits ERC1155 tokens into a specific vault.
*   `depositNative`: Deposits native coin (ETH/Matic etc.) into a specific vault.
*   `addTimeCondition`: Adds a timestamp-based condition to a vault (unlockable after timestamp).
*   `addRandomnessCondition`: Adds a Chainlink VRF randomness condition to a vault (unlockable after randomness is fulfilled).
*   `addContractStateCondition`: Adds a condition based on the boolean outcome of calling a view function on another contract.
*   `requestRandomness`: Triggers a Chainlink VRF request for a vault with a randomness condition. Callable by vault owner or anyone if block.timestamp > request delay.
*   `fulfillRandomness`: Chainlink VRF callback function to receive randomness result and update vault state.
*   `checkVaultConditions`: View function to check if *all* conditions for a vault are currently met.
*   `attemptUnlock`: Attempts to unlock the vault by checking all conditions. If met, changes vault status to Unlocked.
*   `claimShare`: Allows a beneficiary or their delegate to claim their share of assets from an unlocked vault.
*   `delegateClaimant`: Allows a beneficiary to delegate their claiming rights to another address.
*   `revokeDelegate`: Allows a beneficiary to revoke their claiming delegation.
*   `cancelVault`: Allows the vault owner to cancel a vault if no claims have been made and it's not yet unlocked, returning deposited assets.
*   `transferVaultOwnership`: Allows the current vault owner to transfer management ownership of a vault to another address.
*   `setVRFConfig`: Admin function to update Chainlink VRF coordinator, keyhash, subId, and callback gas limit.
*   `adminWithdrawStuckERC20`: Admin function to recover accidentally sent ERC20 tokens not associated with any vault.

*   `adminWithdrawStuckNative`: Admin function to recover accidentally sent native coin not associated with any vault.
*   `emergencyOwnerUnlock`: Owner function to force unlock a vault after a predefined time delay, bypassing conditions.
*   `getVaultDetails`: View function to get basic details of a vault.
*   `getVaultAssets`: View function to get the list of assets held in a vault.
*   `getVaultBeneficiaries`: View function to get the list of beneficiaries and their claim status for a vault.
*   `getUserVaults`: View function to get a list of vault IDs owned by a specific address.
*   `pause`: Admin function to pause contract operations (deposits, unlocks, claims). Inherited from Pausable.
*   `unpause`: Admin function to unpause contract operations. Inherited from Pausable.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Vault:** Supports Native Coin, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 within the *same* vault. This is more complex than single-token escrows or vaults. Requires careful handling of different transfer methods and balance tracking.
2.  **Multi-Conditional Unlock:** Assets are not released by a single event (like a timestamp or a single signature), but by a *set* of conditions all being met (`_checkAllConditionsMet` logic). This allows for highly customized and complex release criteria.
3.  **Diverse Condition Types:** Includes time (`block.timestamp`), secure off-chain randomness (`Chainlink VRF`), and on-chain state (`calling a view function on another contract`). This goes beyond simple time locks.
4.  **Chainlink VRF Integration:** Uses VRF v2 for secure, unpredictable randomness as a potential unlock condition. This adds a "Quantum" element where the "state" (unlockability) depends on a truly random, revealed outcome. The `requestRandomness` and `fulfillRandomness` pattern is implemented. It also includes a mechanism for public randomness requests after a delay if the owner is inactive.
5.  **Cross-Contract State Condition:** The `addContractStateCondition` and `_checkCondition` logic allows the vault's unlockability to depend on the state or outcome of logic in *another* arbitrary smart contract (provided it has a view function returning bool). This enables interaction with external DeFi protocols, governance outcomes, game states, etc.
6.  **Delegated Claiming:** Beneficiaries can delegate their right to claim their share to a third party, adding flexibility for users who might not be able to interact with the contract directly (e.g., cold storage, custodial solutions, specific dApp interfaces).
7.  **Structured Data:** Uses structs and enums extensively to manage vault data, conditions, beneficiaries, and assets in a clear and organized way.
8.  **Owner Emergency Unlock (with delay):** A safety mechanism for the owner to bypass conditions, but with a forced time delay to prevent abuse or allow monitoring/intervention.
9.  **Admin Stuck Asset Recovery:** Standard but important safety feature to prevent permanent loss of funds sent incorrectly.

**Limitations and Potential Improvements (for a production system):**

*   **Gas Costs:** Complex condition checking and especially the `_distributeAssets` loop within `claimShare` could be gas-intensive for vaults with many assets or beneficiaries. Batching claims or optimizing distribution would be needed for large-scale use.
*   **ERC721/ERC1155 Shares:** The current simplified model assigns the full amount of an ERC721/ERC1155 asset to a *single* assigned beneficiary. A more flexible system would allow fractional shares of ERC1155 or assignment of specific ERC721s to different beneficiaries based on share percentage or explicit mapping.
*   **Multiple Conditions of Same Type:** The current `conditions` mapping only allows one condition per `ConditionType`. This could be extended to an array of conditions per type for more complex logic (e.g., multiple time windows, multiple contract state checks).
*   **Condition Logic (AND/OR):** The current logic requires *all* conditions to be met (AND). Allowing OR logic or more complex boolean combinations would increase flexibility but significantly increase complexity.
*   **User Vault Tracking (`_userOwnedVaults`):** The current method of tracking is inefficient for large numbers of vaults or transfers. A more scalable solution might involve external indexing or a different data structure.
*   **ERC1155 Hooks:** The `onERC1155Received` hooks assume the call comes from a valid deposit. Robust verification would be needed in a production scenario.
*   **Contract State Condition Security:** Calling arbitrary external contracts (`staticcall`) is generally safe as it cannot modify state. However, the *interpretation* of return data requires careful handling. The current simple boolean check is a starting point.
*   **No Pausable for all functions:** Pausability was removed from delegate/revoke/config functions as these administrative actions might be necessary even when core vault operations are paused. This is a design choice.

This contract provides a solid foundation for a sophisticated, multi-functional vault with advanced conditional release mechanisms leveraging external data sources like Chainlink VRF and interactions with other smart contracts.
