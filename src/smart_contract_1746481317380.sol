Okay, let's design a complex, non-standard smart contract. We'll create a "Quantum Vault" concept. It's inspired by ideas like entangled states, multi-party control (like multi-sig, but with time and conditional dependencies), and conditional access based on 'aligning' different factors.

**Concept: The Quantum Vault**

This vault holds ERC20 tokens and can only be unlocked when a sufficient number of "Quantum Custodians" align their "Entanglement Gates" *and* a time-based cooldown is satisfied. It also features conditional access for specific parties and an emergency "Quantum Tunneling" unlock mechanism.

---

**Quantum Vault Smart Contract: Outline and Function Summary**

**Concept:** A secure, multi-party controlled vault for ERC20 tokens with complex, time-based, and state-dependent unlock mechanisms inspired by quantum concepts.

**State Variables:**

1.  `owner`: The primary owner of the contract.
2.  `custodians`: List of addresses designated as Quantum Custodians.
3.  `isCustodian`: Mapping to quickly check if an address is a custodian.
4.  `requiredShardAlignment`: The number of custodians whose 'Entanglement Gate' must be true to enable unlocking.
5.  `custodianGateStatus`: Mapping storing the boolean state of each custodian's 'Entanglement Gate'.
6.  `vaultState`: Enum representing the current state (Locked, Unlocked, UnlockCoolingDown).
7.  `lastUnlockAttemptTime`: Timestamp of the last unsuccessful unlock attempt.
8.  `unlockCooldownPeriod`: Time required to wait after a failed unlock attempt before trying again.
9.  `unlockReadyTime`: Timestamp when the vault *could* potentially be unlocked, based on gate alignment and cooldown.
10. `totalERC20Balances`: Mapping storing the total balance of each ERC20 token held by the contract.
11. `stakedERC20Balances`: Mapping storing balances currently designated as 'staked' within the vault (a conceptual internal state).
12. `conditionalAccessGrants`: Mapping allowing specific addresses to withdraw specific tokens under certain conditions.
13. `quantumTunnelReadyTime`: Timestamp after which the emergency quantum tunnel unlock is possible.

**Events:**

1.  `VaultLocked`: Emitted when the vault is locked.
2.  `VaultUnlocked`: Emitted when the vault is unlocked.
3.  `UnlockAttemptFailed`: Emitted on an unsuccessful unlock attempt, includes reason and cooldown start time.
4.  `GateStatusChanged`: Emitted when a custodian changes their gate status.
5.  `CustodianAdded`: Emitted when a new custodian is added.
6.  `CustodianRemoved`: Emitted when a custodian is removed.
7.  `RequiredShardsChanged`: Emitted when the required alignment threshold changes.
8.  `TokensDeposited`: Emitted when tokens are deposited.
9.  `TokensWithdrawn`: Emitted when tokens are withdrawn via normal unlock.
10. `ConditionalTokensWithdrawn`: Emitted when tokens are withdrawn via conditional access.
11. `TokensStaked`: Emitted when tokens are designated as staked.
12. `TokensUnstaked`: Emitted when tokens are moved from staked state.
13. `QuantumTunnelTriggered`: Emitted when the emergency tunnel is used.
14. `ConditionalAccessGranted`: Emitted when conditional access is granted.
15. `ConditionalAccessRevoked`: Emitted when conditional access is revoked.

**Modifiers:**

1.  `onlyOwner`: Restricts function access to the contract owner.
2.  `onlyCustodian`: Restricts function access to a designated custodian.
3.  `whenLocked`: Allows function execution only when the vault is locked.
4.  `whenUnlocked`: Allows function execution only when the vault is unlocked.
5.  `whenUnlockCoolingDown`: Allows function execution only when the vault is in cooldown.
6.  `whenGateAlignmentMet`: Checks if the required number of gates are true.
7.  `whenUnlockCooldownPassed`: Checks if the cooldown period has passed since the last failed attempt.

**Functions:** (20+ functions)

1.  **Constructor:** Initializes the owner, initial custodians, required alignment, cooldown period, and quantum tunnel start time.
2.  **`addCustodian(address _newCustodian)`:** (Owner only) Adds a new address to the list of custodians.
3.  **`removeCustodian(address _custodianToRemove)`:** (Owner only) Removes an address from the list of custodians.
4.  **`changeRequiredShardAlignment(uint256 _newRequiredAlignment)`:** (Owner only) Changes the number of gate alignments needed for unlock. Must be <= total custodians.
5.  **`transferOwnership(address _newOwner)`:** (Owner only) Transfers contract ownership.
6.  **`setGateStatus(bool _status)`:** (Custodian only) Sets the custodian's individual entanglement gate status.
7.  **`getGateStatus(address _custodian)`:** (View) Returns the current gate status of a specific custodian.
8.  **`getCustodianGateAlignmentCount()`:** (View) Returns the current count of custodians with their gate set to true.
9.  **`attemptUnlock()`:** (Any address) Attempts to unlock the vault. Checks gate alignment and cooldown. Updates vault state and emits events.
10. **`lockVault()`:** (Owner or any Custodian) Manually locks the vault.
11. **`depositERC20(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:** (Any address) Allows depositing specified ERC20 tokens into the vault. Requires prior approval. Updates `totalERC20Balances`.
12. **`withdrawERC20(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:** (Any address, `whenUnlocked`) Allows withdrawing specified ERC20 tokens from the vault if unlocked. Updates `totalERC20Balances`.
13. **`stakeTokens(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:** (Any address, `whenLocked`) Designates a portion of deposited tokens as 'staked' within the vault's internal accounting. Updates `stakedERC20Balances` and decreases `totalERC20Balances` conceptually (or just moves between internal states).
14. **`unstakeTokens(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:** (Any address, `whenLocked`) Moves tokens back from 'staked' to 'total' balance within internal accounting.
15. **`claimStakedYield(address _token)`:** (Any address, Conceptual/Placeholder) A function to *conceptually* claim yield. In a real system, this would interact with a DeFi protocol. Here, it might just be a placeholder or require specific conditions. *Implementation Note: A real yield mechanism is too complex for this example without integrating external protocols. This function can be a simple marker or require specific, complex conditions.*
16. **`grantConditionalAccess(address _token, address _grantee, uint256 _maxAmount)`:** (Owner only) Grants a specific address the ability to withdraw a maximum amount of a specific token via the conditional access function, *even if the vault is locked*.
17. **`revokeConditionalAccess(address _token, address _grantee)`:** (Owner only) Revokes a previously granted conditional access.
18. **`withdrawConditional(address _token, address _grantee, uint256 _amount)`:** (The grantee) Allows a granted address to withdraw tokens up to their granted limit, bypassing the main unlock state.
19. **`triggerQuantumTunnel(address _token, uint256 _amount)`:** (Owner and ALL Custodians must agree, or after `quantumTunnelReadyTime`) An emergency bypass function allowing withdrawal regardless of normal gates, under very strict conditions (e.g., multi-party call or significant time elapsed).
20. **`getVaultState()`:** (View) Returns the current state of the vault (Locked, Unlocked, Cooling Down).
21. **`getERC20Balance(address _token)`:** (View) Returns the total balance of a specific ERC20 token held by the contract.
22. **`getStakedERC20Balance(address _token)`:** (View) Returns the total balance of a specific ERC20 token currently marked as staked.
23. **`isCustodian(address _address)`:** (View) Checks if an address is a custodian.
24. **`getCustodians()`:** (View) Returns the list of all custodian addresses.
25. **`getRequiredShardAlignment()`:** (View) Returns the number of gate alignments needed.
26. **`getLastUnlockAttemptTime()`:** (View) Returns the timestamp of the last unlock attempt.
27. **`getUnlockCooldownPeriod()`:** (View) Returns the required cooldown duration.
28. **`getUnlockReadyTime()`:** (View) Returns the estimated time when unlock *could* be possible based on current state and cooldown.
29. **`getQuantumTunnelReadyTime()`:** (View) Returns the timestamp when the quantum tunnel unlock becomes available based on time elapsed.
30. **`getConditionalAccessGrant(address _token, address _grantee)`:** (View) Returns the maximum amount a specific grantee can withdraw for a given token via conditional access.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts:**

1.  **Quantum-Inspired Access Control:** Instead of a simple multi-sig threshold or time-lock, the primary unlock (`attemptUnlock`) requires a combination:
    *   A sufficient *number* of distinct parties ("Custodians") must independently set their individual boolean flags ("Entanglement Gates") to `true`. This simulates the need for multiple conditions to be "aligned".
    *   There's a time-based cooldown *only* after a *failed* unlock attempt. This prevents brute-forcing the gates by repeated attempts.
2.  **Vault States:** The `VaultState` enum introduces distinct states (`Locked`, `Unlocked`, `UnlockCoolingDown`), adding complexity to the transition logic.
3.  **Conditional Access (`withdrawConditional`):** This allows for predetermined, limited bypasses of the main lock mechanism for specific tokens and addresses. It's a form of pre-approved delegation that doesn't require the full vault to be unlocked. This is useful for allowing certain expenses or payments from the vault while keeping the majority of funds locked.
4.  **Quantum Tunneling (`triggerQuantumTunnel`):** An emergency or delayed bypass mechanism. It represents an alternative, higher-cost (in terms of required agreement or time) way to access funds, bypassing the normal gate mechanism. The condition is either extreme multi-party agreement (conceptualized here as owner + all custodians needing to *enable* this, or a simpler check as implemented) or a very long time lock.
5.  **Internal "Staking":** The `stakeTokens` and `unstakeTokens` functions manage tokens *within* the vault's accounting, changing their status from 'available' to 'staked'. This could conceptually link to future yield distribution mechanisms or simply denote funds designated for a specific purpose while locked. It doesn't involve external DeFi protocols in this example but sets up the structure for it.
6.  **Comprehensive Query Functions:** A large number of `view` functions are provided to allow external parties (like a UI or monitoring system) to inspect the complex state of the vault, including individual gate statuses, alignment count, cooldown timers, conditional grants, etc.

This contract uses standard Solidity features but combines them in a novel way to create a layered, conditional, and time-dependent access control system that goes beyond typical multi-sig or simple time-locks. It provides a framework for managing assets under complex, multi-factor requirements.
