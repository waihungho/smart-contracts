Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract designed with a variety of interesting, advanced, creative, and trendy functions. It focuses on a "Quantum Vault" concept, combining standard asset holding with probabilistic withdrawals, state-based locks, delegated permissions, emergency mechanisms, and delayed claims, simulating some abstract "quantum" effects on withdrawal conditions.

This contract is complex and designed for demonstration purposes to showcase various concepts. It includes features like:

*   Handling multiple asset types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155).
*   Advanced access control (owner, delegates).
*   Multiple locking mechanisms (time-based, state-based).
*   A simulated probabilistic/state-dependent withdrawal system ("Quantum Fluctuation").
*   Emergency withdrawal escape hatches.
*   Delayed beneficiary claims.
*   Asset bonding to states.
*   Pause functionality.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is highly complex and contains features designed for educational/demonstration purposes. It has not been formally audited and should *not* be used in a production environment without extensive security review and testing. The "quantum" randomness is simulated using block data, which is exploitable and *not* suitable for high-security randomness needs in production.

## Smart Contract Outline: QuantumVault

1.  **Purpose:** A secure vault for holding ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 assets with complex locking mechanisms, probabilistic withdrawal conditions, delegated access, emergency bypass, and delayed beneficiary claims.
2.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   Multi-asset holding.
    *   Time-based locks.
    *   Vault State based locks (simulated "Quantum Fluctuation").
    *   Probabilistic withdrawals based on Vault State.
    *   Delegated withdrawal permissions.
    *   Emergency withdrawal mechanism.
    *   Delayed beneficiary claim mechanism.
    *   Asset bonding to specific Vault States.
    *   Pausable functionality.
3.  **Access Control:** Owner, Permitted Delegates.
4.  **Vault States:** An Enum (`Stable`, `Fluctuating`, `Entangled`) represents the simulated "quantum state" affecting withdrawals.
5.  **Key Data Structures:**
    *   Mappings for storing balances/ownerships of assets.
    *   Mappings for user/asset specific time locks.
    *   Mapping for user state locks.
    *   Mapping for delegated withdrawal permissions.
    *   Variables for emergency threshold, beneficiary, claim delay.
    *   Current Vault State variable.
    *   Mapping for bonded assets.
6.  **Events:** Signalling deposits, withdrawals, lock changes, state changes, etc.

## Function Summary: QuantumVault

This contract contains the following public/external functions (30+ functions):

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner and sets the initial state.
2.  `receive()`: Allows receiving ETH deposits directly.
3.  `depositETH()`: Explicit function for depositing ETH.
4.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Deposits a specific amount of an ERC20 token. Requires prior approval.
5.  `depositERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: Deposits a specific ERC721 token. Requires prior approval or `isApprovedForAll`.
6.  `depositERC1155(address token, uint256 id, uint256 amount)`: Deposits a specific amount of an ERC1155 token ID. Requires prior approval or `isApprovedForAll`.
7.  `withdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Standard withdrawal of ETH (subject to locks).
8.  `withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Standard withdrawal of ERC20 (subject to locks).
9.  `withdrawERC721(address token, uint256 tokenId)`: Standard withdrawal of ERC721 (subject to locks).
10. `withdrawERC1155(address token, uint256 id, uint256 amount)`: Standard withdrawal of ERC1155 (subject to locks).
11. `batchWithdrawERC20(address[] calldata tokens, uint256[] calldata amounts)`: Withdraws multiple ERC20 tokens in one transaction.
12. `delegateWithdrawPermission(address delegatee, bool permission)`: Owner or user delegates/revokes permission for another address to manage *their* assets.
13. `revokeWithdrawPermission(address delegatee)`: User explicitly revokes delegated permission.
14. `withdrawETHAsDelegate(address user, uint256 amount)`: Delegate withdraws ETH on behalf of a user (subject to user's locks).
15. `withdrawERC20AsDelegate(address user, address token, uint256 amount)`: Delegate withdraws ERC20 on behalf of a user (subject to user's locks).
16. `setTimeLock(uint256 unlockTime)`: Sets a future timestamp before which withdrawals are locked for the caller.
17. `clearTimeLock()`: Clears the caller's general time lock.
18. `setAssetTimeLock(address token, uint256 unlockTime)`: Sets a future timestamp before which a *specific* asset withdrawal is locked for the caller.
19. `clearAssetTimeLock(address token)`: Clears the caller's time lock for a specific asset.
20. `setVaultStateLock(VaultState requiredState)`: Sets a condition that withdrawals are only allowed when the contract's `currentVaultState` matches `requiredState`.
21. `clearVaultStateLock()`: Clears the caller's state-based lock.
22. `triggerSimulatedQuantumEvent()`: Owner function to potentially change the `currentVaultState` based on simulated randomness. This affects state-based and probabilistic locks.
23. `getETHBalance(address user)`: Returns the ETH balance of a user in the vault.
24. `getERC20Balance(address user, address token)`: Returns the ERC20 balance of a user for a specific token.
25. `getERC721Count(address user, address token)`: Returns the count of ERC721 tokens of a specific type owned by a user in the vault. (Note: Tracking specific tokenIds requires more complex state).
26. `getERC1155Balance(address user, address token, uint256 id)`: Returns the ERC1155 balance of a user for a specific token ID.
27. `getCurrentVaultState()`: Returns the current simulated "Quantum" state of the vault.
28. `predictProbabilisticWithdrawalOutcome(VaultState stateToTest, uint256 probabilityThreshold)`: Pure function to predict the theoretical success outcome of a probabilistic withdrawal based on a potential state and threshold.
29. `setProbabilisticWithdrawalThreshold(uint256 threshold)`: Owner sets the threshold (0-10000, representing 0-100%) for probabilistic withdrawals to succeed when in a `Fluctuating` state.
30. `tryProbabilisticWithdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Attempts to withdraw ETH probabilistically if the vault is in `Fluctuating` state. Success depends on the threshold and simulated randomness.
31. `tryProbabilisticWithdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Attempts to withdraw ERC20 probabilistically.
32. `registerEmergencyThreshold(uint256 ethThreshold)`: Owner sets a minimum *total* ETH threshold in the contract. If total ETH falls below this, emergency withdrawal is possible for anyone.
33. `triggerEmergencyWithdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone to withdraw their ETH if the total contract ETH balance is below the `emergencyThreshold`. Bypasses other locks.
34. `setBeneficiary(address payable _beneficiary)`: User sets a beneficiary who can claim assets after a delay.
35. `setBeneficiaryClaimDelay(uint256 delayInSeconds)`: User sets how long after the user is inactive the beneficiary can claim.
36. `claimAsBeneficiary()`: Beneficiary attempts to claim all assets if the user has been inactive long enough. (User inactivity check is simplified here).
37. `bondERC20ToState(address token, uint256 amount, VaultState stateToBondTo)`: Bonds a specific amount of ERC20 such that it can only be redeemed when the vault is in `stateToBondTo`.
38. `redeemBondedERC20(address token)`: Attempts to redeem bonded ERC20 assets if the current state matches the bonded state.
39. `pause()`: Owner pauses deposits and standard withdrawals.
40. `unpause()`: Owner unpauses.
41. `withdrawAccruedFees(address token)`: Owner function to withdraw any ERC20 tokens sent *to* the contract inadvertently or as fees. (Simplified fee concept).
42. `withdrawAccruedETH()`: Owner function to withdraw excess ETH (not linked to user deposits, e.g., sent directly before `receive` existed).
