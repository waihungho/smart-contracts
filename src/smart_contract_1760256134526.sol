Here's a smart contract in Solidity called `DAIPNexus` (Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property Nexus), designed with advanced, creative, and trendy concepts, boasting over 20 functions.

This contract focuses on the lifecycle of **conceptual and partially formed intellectual property (IP)**, rather than just finished art. Imagine an idea for a game, a scientific hypothesis, a story outline, or a design sketch â€“ the DAIPNexus allows for its fractionalized ownership, dynamic licensing, AI-driven valuation, and community-driven evolution.

### **DAIPNexus: Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property Nexus**

---

### **Outline & Function Summary**

This smart contract creates a novel platform for the fractionalized ownership, dynamic licensing, and AI-augmented evolution of conceptual and partially formed intellectual property (IP). It goes beyond simple NFT art, focusing on the genesis, development, and collaborative refinement of ideas.

It integrates:
*   Fractionalized ownership of IP concepts.
*   Dynamic, usage-based licensing with automated (or pseudo-automated) royalty distribution.
*   A simulated AI oracle for valuation and potential scoring.
*   Staking mechanisms for "IP growth" and reputation building.
*   A mechanism for proposing and voting on "IP mutations" or derivatives.
*   Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance for core decisions.
*   Progressive IP revelation based on time or milestones.

This contract aims to foster a collaborative environment where ideas can be nurtured, valued, and evolved by a community, with transparent ownership and fair compensation mechanisms.

**A. Core IP Lifecycle & Ownership (6 Functions)**

1.  `createConceptualIP(string memory _metadataURI, uint256 _initialSupply)`
    *   **Summary:** Registers a new idea/concept on the platform, minting initial fractional ownership tokens to the creator. The `_metadataURI` points to off-chain data describing the IP.
2.  `mintIPFractions(uint256 _ipId, address _to, uint256 _amount)`
    *   **Summary:** Mints additional fractional ownership tokens for a given IP to a specified address. Only the IP creator or its designated custodian can perform this.
3.  `burnIPFractions(uint256 _ipId, address _from, uint256 _amount)`
    *   **Summary:** Burns (destroys) fractional ownership tokens from an address, reducing the total supply for that IP. Callable by the IP creator or custodian.
4.  `transferIPFractions(uint256 _ipId, address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount)`
    *   **Summary:** Transfers fractional ownership tokens between addresses, similar to standard token transfers.
5.  `updateIPMetadata(uint256 _ipId, string memory _newMetadataURI)`
    *   **Summary:** Allows the IP creator or custodian (or DAO via governance) to update the IP's off-chain description or details by changing its metadata URI.
6.  `designateIPCustodian(uint256 _ipId, address _newCustodian)`
    *   **Summary:** Assigns a primary manager (custodian) for an IP, who gains enhanced privileges for managing the IP's lifecycle, potentially different from the original creator.

**B. Collaborative Development & Dynamic Licensing (5 Functions)**

7.  `addIPCollaborator(uint256 _ipId, address _collaborator, bytes32 _role)`
    *   **Summary:** Grants specific, predefined roles (e.g., `keccak256("DEVELOPER")`, `keccak256("ARTIST")`) to an address for a specific IP, enabling structured collaboration.
8.  `revokeIPCollaboratorRole(uint256 _ipId, address _collaborator, bytes32 _role)`
    *   **Summary:** Revokes a previously granted role from an IP collaborator.
9.  `proposeDynamicLicenseTerms(uint256 _ipId, string memory _licenseURI, uint256 _duration, uint256 _baseFee, uint256 _royaltyRateBps)`
    *   **Summary:** Proposes a new dynamic license for an IP, defining terms like its duration, a one-time base fee for acceptance, and a royalty rate (in basis points) for future usage.
10. `acceptIPLicense(uint256 _ipId, uint256 _licenseId)`
    *   **Summary:** Allows a third party to accept a proposed license, paying the base fee upfront to the DAO treasury, and activating the license for a defined period.
11. `recordLicenseUsageAndPayRoyalty(uint256 _ipId, uint256 _licenseId, uint256 _usageMetric)`
    *   **Summary:** Records usage data for an active license. This function (typically called by a trusted oracle or integration) calculates and distributes royalties to the IP's stakeholders based on the recorded usage and the license's royalty rate.

**C. AI-Augmented Valuation & Evolution (5 Functions)**

12. `requestAIEvaluation(uint256 _ipId)`
    *   **Summary:** Triggers a request for an external (simulated) AI oracle to evaluate the IP's potential, market fit, or viability. This would typically emit an event monitored by an off-chain AI system.
13. `setAIEvaluationResult(uint256 _ipId, uint256 _newScore, string memory _aiReportURI)`
    *   **Summary:** A callback function for the designated AI oracle to post its evaluation results, including a score (e.g., 0-1000) and a URI to a detailed report. Only the trusted AI oracle address can call this.
14. `stakeForIPGrowth(uint256 _ipId)`
    *   **Summary:** Users stake value (e.g., ETH, or a future DAO token) to express belief in an IP's growth potential. This contributes to the IP's "growth pool" and signals community support.
15. `claimGrowthRewards(uint256 _ipId)`
    *   **Summary:** Allows users to claim rewards from an IP's growth pool. (Simplified for this example; in a real scenario, complex reward logic based on IP success would be implemented).
16. `proposeIPMutation(uint256 _originalIpId, string memory _mutationMetadataURI)`
    *   **Summary:** A mechanism to propose a new, derivative IP ("mutation" or "fork") that explicitly links back to an original IP. This creates a placeholder that would then require governance approval to become a fully recognized IP.

**D. Decentralized Governance & Treasury (4 Functions)**

17. `submitDAIPProposal(bytes memory _callData, address _target, string memory _description)`
    *   **Summary:** Allows qualified participants (e.g., high fractional IP owners, stakers, or `owner` for initial setup) to submit a governance proposal, including an encoded function call to be executed if the proposal passes.
18. `voteOnDAIPProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`
    *   **Summary:** Enables participants to vote on submitted governance proposals. Voting power could be tied to IP ownership or staked tokens (simplified to 1 address = 1 vote for this example).
19. `executeDAIPProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`
    *   **Summary:** Executes a proposal's associated `callData` on its `target` address after it has passed the voting threshold and any required grace period.
20. `distributeDAIPTreasuryFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`
    *   **Summary:** Distributes funds from the DAO treasury to a specified recipient. This function is designed to be callable *only* via a successful governance proposal, ensuring democratic control over funds.

**E. Advanced Features (2 Functions)**

21. `scheduleProgressiveIPReveal(uint256 _ipId, uint256 _revealTime, string memory _revealedMetadataURI)`
    *   **Summary:** Sets a future timestamp and a new metadata URI, indicating that additional IP details will be publicly disclosed at that time. Only the IP creator or custodian can schedule this.
22. `triggerProgressiveIPReveal(uint256 _ipId)`
    *   **Summary:** Executes the progressive reveal once the scheduled `_revealTime` has passed. This updates the IP's primary metadata URI to include the previously hidden content, making it publicly available.

**Total Functions: 22**
