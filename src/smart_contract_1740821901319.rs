/**
 * @title Dynamic Royalty Splitter with Governance and NFT Integration
 * @author Bard
 * @notice This contract implements a dynamic royalty splitter with advanced features:
 *   - Dynamic Royalty Splits: Allows royalty percentages to be adjusted dynamically based on DAO voting.
 *   - Governance: Implements a simple DAO structure using voting to control royalty splits and other parameters.
 *   - NFT Integration: Integrates with an ERC721 NFT contract to allow NFT holders to participate in governance and potentially receive a portion of royalties.
 *   - Pausability: The contract can be paused by an admin, preventing any transfers.
 *   - Royalty Claiming: Allows different beneficiary types (creator, DAO, NFT holders) to claim their royalties.
 *
 *  Outline:
 *  1.  **State Variables**: Define core variables like royalty recipient addresses, percentages, governance parameters, etc.
 *  2.  **Events**: Define events to track royalty distribution, governance actions, and configuration changes.
 *  3.  **Modifiers**: Implement modifiers for access control (admin, governance) and state validation.
 *  4.  **Constructor**: Initialize the contract with initial parameters (admin, NFT contract, etc.).
 *  5.  **Royalty Management Functions**:
 *      - `payRoyalty(uint256 _amount)`:  Receives royalties and distributes them according to the current splits.
 *      - `setRecipientPercentage(address _recipient, uint256 _percentage)`: Propose updates to recipient percentages.
 *      - `claimRoyalty(address _recipient)`: Allows recipients to claim their accumulated royalties.
 *  6.  **Governance Functions**:
 *      - `createProposal(address _recipient, uint256 _newPercentage, string memory _description)`: Creates a new proposal to change royalty splits.
 *      - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows users (including NFT holders) to vote on a proposal.
 *      - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it meets the quorum and support requirements.
 *  7.  **NFT Integration Functions**:
 *      - `setNFTContract(address _nftContract)`: Sets the NFT contract address (admin only).
 *      - `getNFTBalance(address _account)`: Returns the number of NFTs held by an address.
 *  8.  **Admin Functions**:
 *      - `pause()`: Pauses the contract.
 *      - `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract.
 *      - `withdrawFunds(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the admin to withdraw excess funds (edge case).

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dynamic Royalty Splits:** The `recipientPercentages` mapping now holds the royalty percentage (out of 10000, representing 100%) for each recipient. `totalPercentage` tracks the sum.
* **Governance:** Implements a simple DAO-like structure. A `Proposal` struct stores details about suggested changes.  The `createProposal`, `vote`, and `executeProposal` functions allow for voting and executing proposals.  Quorum is implemented.
* **NFT Integration:**  The contract allows integration with an ERC721 contract (`nftContract`). The `getNFTBalance` function checks the balance of NFT holders.  Critically, the `getVotingWeight` function now factors in NFT holdings, giving holders additional voting power.  This directly ties governance to the NFT ecosystem. `getTotalVotingPower` returns the total voting power based on NFT supply.
* **Pausability:** The contract can be paused using the `pause` and `unpause` functions, providing an emergency stop mechanism.
* **Royalty Claiming:** The `payRoyalty` function distributes royalties proportionally to the recipients based on `recipientPercentages`.  The `claimRoyalty` function lets recipients withdraw their accumulated royalties. Uses `payable` address and `call{value: ...}` for the transfer. `pendingWithdrawals` tracks the amount each recipient is owed.
* **Admin Control:** An `admin` address is defined with the `onlyAdmin` modifier.
* **Events:** Includes events for key actions, such as `RoyaltyPaid`, `PercentageUpdated`, `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`, `ContractPaused`, `ContractUnpaused`, `NFTContractUpdated` and `Withdrawal`, making the contract more transparent and auditable.
* **Modifiers:** Uses modifiers (`onlyAdmin`, `whenNotPaused`, `validPercentage`, `validRecipient`, `proposalExists`, `proposalNotExecuted`, `votingPeriodActive`) to enforce access control and validate input.
* **Error Handling:**  Includes `require` statements to handle potential errors and prevent unexpected behavior.
* **Overflow/Underflow Protection:**  Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow/underflow protection.
* **Receive Function:**  Includes a `receive()` function to allow the contract to receive ether directly.
* **ERC721 Interface:**  Includes a simple `IERC721` interface for interacting with the NFT contract.  This avoids requiring users to import complex libraries.
* **`distributeRoyalties()`:** The `distributeRoyalties()` function has been extracted as an internal function to improve code organization and readability.
* **`calculateQuorum()`:**  Calculates the quorum dynamically, based on a percentage of the total voting power.  This makes governance more adaptable.
* **Voting Period:**  The `votingPeriod` is now configurable (default is 7 days) and is enforced in the `vote` and `executeProposal` functions.  `startTime` is tracked for the proposal.
* **Edge Case Handling:** The `withdrawFunds` function allows the admin to withdraw funds in edge cases.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy the NFT contract.**  You'll need an ERC721 contract.
2.  **Deploy the `DynamicRoyaltySplitter` contract.** Provide the address of your deployed NFT contract.
3.  **Set Royalty Recipients:**  The constructor sets an initial split.  Use governance to adjust the royalty percentages.
4.  **Pay Royalties:** Send ether to the `payRoyalty` function.
5.  **Claim Royalties:** Royalty recipients can call `claimRoyalty` to withdraw their earned funds.
6.  **Governance:** Admin create proposals. User can vote these proposal. If proposal meet the criteria, admin execute the proposal.
