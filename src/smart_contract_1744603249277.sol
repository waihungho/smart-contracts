/**
 * @title Reputation-Based Dynamic Feature Access Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a reputation system that dynamically controls access to various features and functionalities.
 *      This contract is designed to be creative and advanced, going beyond basic token contracts or simple DAOs.
 *      It focuses on leveraging on-chain reputation for tiered access, personalized experiences, and community engagement.
 *      This is a conceptual example and may require further security audits and gas optimization for production use.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * **1. Reputation Management:**
 *    - `awardReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner to award reputation points to users.
 *    - `deductReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the contract owner to deduct reputation points from users.
 *    - `getReputation(address _user)`: Returns the reputation points of a given user.
 *    - `setReputationThreshold(uint256 _threshold, uint256 _featureId)`: Allows the owner to set reputation threshold for specific features.
 *    - `getReputationThreshold(uint256 _featureId)`: Returns the reputation threshold for a given feature.
 *    - `transferReputation(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to transfer reputation points to other users.
 *
 * **2. Feature Definition and Access Control:**
 *    - `defineFeature(uint256 _featureId, string memory _featureName)`: Allows the owner to define new features within the contract.
 *    - `isFeatureDefined(uint256 _featureId)`: Checks if a feature ID is defined.
 *    - `getFeatureName(uint256 _featureId)`: Returns the name of a feature.
 *    - `checkFeatureAccess(address _user, uint256 _featureId)`: Checks if a user has sufficient reputation to access a specific feature.
 *    - `grantFeatureAccessOverride(address _user, uint256 _featureId)`: Allows the owner to manually grant feature access to a user, bypassing reputation check.
 *    - `revokeFeatureAccessOverride(address _user, uint256 _featureId)`: Allows the owner to revoke manually granted feature access.
 *    - `hasFeatureAccessOverride(address _user, uint256 _featureId)`: Checks if a user has an override for a feature.
 *
 * **3. Dynamic Content/Functionality based on Reputation:**
 *    - `executeReputationBasedFunction(uint256 _functionId)`: A generic function that executes different logic based on the user's reputation level and the function ID. (Illustrative, needs specific function IDs and logic implementation in a real-world scenario).
 *    - `registerReputationTier(uint256 _tierId, uint256 _minReputation, string memory _tierName)`: Defines reputation tiers with minimum reputation requirements.
 *    - `getUserTier(address _user)`: Returns the reputation tier of a user based on their reputation points.
 *    - `getTierName(uint256 _tierId)`: Returns the name of a reputation tier.
 *
 * **4. Reputation Decay and Reset:**
 *    - `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 _decayRate)`: Sets the rate at which reputation decays over time (e.g., percentage decay per block).
 *    - `applyReputationDecay()`: Manually trigger reputation decay for all users. (Ideally, this should be automated or triggered in other functions).
 *    - `resetUserReputation(address _user)`: Allows the owner to reset a user's reputation to zero.
 *
 * **Function Summaries:**
 *
 * **Reputation Management:**
 *   - `awardReputation`: Increase a user's reputation.
 *   - `deductReputation`: Decrease a user's reputation.
 *   - `getReputation`: View a user's reputation score.
 *   - `setReputationThreshold`: Define reputation needed to access a feature.
 *   - `getReputationThreshold`: View reputation threshold for a feature.
 *   - `transferReputation`: Allow users to send reputation to others.
 *
 * **Feature Definition and Access Control:**
 *   - `defineFeature`: Create a new feature with a unique ID and name.
 *   - `isFeatureDefined`: Check if a feature ID exists.
 *   - `getFeatureName`: Retrieve the name of a feature.
 *   - `checkFeatureAccess`: Verify if a user meets the reputation requirement for a feature.
 *   - `grantFeatureAccessOverride`: Manually give a user access to a feature (owner-only).
 *   - `revokeFeatureAccessOverride`: Remove manually granted feature access (owner-only).
 *   - `hasFeatureAccessOverride`: Check if a user has a feature access override.
 *
 * **Dynamic Content/Functionality:**
 *   - `executeReputationBasedFunction`: Execute different code paths based on user reputation and function ID (conceptual).
 *   - `registerReputationTier`: Define reputation tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).
 *   - `getUserTier`: Determine a user's tier based on reputation.
 *   - `getTierName`: Get the name of a reputation tier.
 *
 * **Reputation Decay and Reset:**
 *   - `setReputationDecayRate`: Configure the rate at which reputation decreases over time.
 *   - `applyReputationDecay`: Trigger reputation decay for all users.
 *   - `resetUserReputation`: Set a user's reputation back to zero (owner-only).
