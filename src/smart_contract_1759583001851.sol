Here's a Solidity smart contract named `NeuroGenesisProtocol` that implements an advanced, creative, and trendy concept: **Decentralized AI Model Component Marketplace & Synthesizer with Dynamic Royalties and Reputation**.

This protocol allows users to:
*   **Contribute AI Model "Neuron Segments":** These are conceptual units representing a specific function, training dataset, or architectural component of an AI model, stored as dynamic NFTs.
*   **Synthesize "Cognitive Models":** Combine multiple Neuron Segments into a larger, functional AI model, also represented as a dynamic NFT with versioning.
*   **Dynamic Value Accrual:** When a Cognitive Model is licensed for usage, fees are collected and dynamically distributed among its constituent Neuron Segment contributors and the model synthesizer, based on their perceived utility/reputation (via attestation stakes).
*   **Reputation & Attestation:** Users can stake tokens to attest to the quality or effectiveness of Neuron Segments or Cognitive Models, influencing their visibility and royalty share.
*   **Evolvable Models:** Cognitive Models can be upgraded by swapping or adding new Neuron Segments, leading to new versions and adjusted economic structures.

**Outline:**

**I. Core Data Structures:** Defines the fundamental components of the protocol, including `NeuronSegment`, `CognitiveModel`, `CognitiveModelVersion`, `Attestation`, and `License`. These structs enable the representation of AI components as dynamic NFTs and manage their associated data.

**II. Neuron Segment Management:** Functions for creating, updating, and owning individual AI model components. These act as the building blocks for larger AI models, featuring registration, metadata updates, transfers, and stake management.

**III. Cognitive Model Synthesis & Versioning:** Functions for assembling Neuron Segments into complex AI models and managing their upgrades. This section covers the creation of new models, their iterative improvement through versioning, and the critical approval process for using external segments.

**IV. Dynamic Royalty & Usage Fees:** Mechanics for licensing models, collecting usage fees, and distributing royalties based on a dynamic utility/reputation system. This ensures fair compensation for contributors based on the value their components generate.

**V. Attestation & Reputation System:** Functions for users to provide feedback and stake on the quality of segments and models. This decentralized reputation system influences royalty distribution and overall trust within the protocol.

**VI. Protocol Management & Governance:** Admin controls for setting protocol parameters, and pausing/unpausing critical operations for security and maintenance.

**VII. Query Functions:** View functions to retrieve detailed information about segments, models, versions, and attestations, providing transparency and auditability.
