Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract called `QuantumQuorum`. It implements an advanced decentralized governance system with concepts inspired metaphorically by quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement, collapse) applied to voting states and dynamics, complex weighted voting, dynamic quorum, layered delegation, and conditional proposal execution. It aims for uniqueness by combining these elements in a specific, non-standard way, avoiding direct duplication of major DAO frameworks.

It includes over 20 functions covering proposal lifecycle, voting, complex delegation, reputation/stake mechanics (simulated for this example), system parameters, and querying state.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex example designed to meet the prompt's requirements for advanced/creative concepts and function count. It involves significant complexity and potential edge cases. Deploying such a contract requires extensive security audits and testing. Reputation and stake mechanics are simplified/simulated for demonstration.

**Outline & Function Summary: QuantumQuorum Smart Contract**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumQuorum`

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Quantum-Inspired Voting States:** Proposals and votes transition through conceptual states (`Superposed`, `Collapsed`) representing uncertainty and finality.
*   **Complex Weighted Voting:** Voting power is derived from a combination of reputation, staked tokens, and potentially other factors (simulated here), calculated dynamically.
*   **Dynamic Quorum:** The minimum voting weight required for a proposal to pass is calculated dynamically based on system parameters and possibly the total active voting weight.
*   **Layered Delegation:** Users can delegate their voting power globally or specifically for individual proposals.
*   **Conditional Execution:** Proposals can include conditions that must be met *after* voting passes before the proposed actions can be executed.
*   **Reputation & Stake:** Mechanisms to track and influence a user's voting power (simulated stake/reputation tokens).
*   **Parameter Governance:** Key system parameters can be changed through governance proposals.

**Enums:**
*   `ProposalState`: `Superposed` (Voting Active), `Collapsed` (Voting Ended, Outcome Determined), `Executable` (Passed & Conditions Met), `Executed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`.
*   `VoteType`: `Abstain`, `Yes`, `No`.

**Structs:**
*   `Proposal`: Stores details of a proposal, including state, actions, parameters, vote counts (after collapse), and execution conditions.
*   `Voter`: Stores voter-specific data like reputation, stake, global delegatee, and per-proposal delegatees.
*   `SystemParameters`: Stores configurable parameters like voting period, quorum basis, minimum reputation to propose, etc.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Contract owner (for initial setup/privileged operations).
*   `proposalCounter`: Counter for unique proposal IDs.
*   `proposals`: Mapping from proposal ID to `Proposal` struct.
*   `voters`: Mapping from voter address to `Voter` struct.
*   `proposalVotes`: Mapping from proposal ID to voter address to `VoteType`.
*   `parameters`: Stores the current system parameters.
*   `totalReputationSupply`: Total conceptual reputation.
*   `totalStakedTokens`: Total conceptual staked tokens.
*   `reentrancyGuard`: Basic guard for external calls.

**Events:**
*   `ProposalCreated`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
*   `Voted`: Emitted when a user casts or changes a vote.
*   `DelegationChanged`: Emitted when global delegation changes.
*   `ProposalSpecificDelegationChanged`: Emitted when per-proposal delegation changes.
*   `ProposalStateChanged`: Emitted when a proposal's state changes.
*   `ProposalOutcome`: Emitted when a proposal's outcome is determined (`Collapsed`).
*   `ProposalExecuted`: Emitted when a proposal's actions are executed.
*   `ParameterChanged`: Emitted when a system parameter is updated.
*   `ReputationMinted`: Emitted when reputation is minted.
*   `ReputationBurned`: Emitted when reputation is burned.
*   `TokensStaked`: Emitted when tokens are staked.
*   `TokensUnstaked`: Emitted when tokens are unstaked.

**Function Summary (Total: 26):**

**Proposal Management (6 functions):**
1.  `createProposal`: Creates a new proposal (state starts as `Superposed`). Requires minimum reputation. Defines target actions and execution conditions.
2.  `cancelProposal`: Allows the proposer to cancel a proposal if it's still `Superposed`.
3.  `finalizeProposal`: Ends the voting period for a proposal, calculates weighted votes, determines the outcome, and transitions state to `Collapsed` or `Failed`. This is the 'collapse' event.
4.  `checkAndSetExecutable`: Callable after `finalizeProposal` to check if execution conditions are met and transition state to `Executable`.
5.  `executeProposal`: Executes the proposed actions if the proposal state is `Executable`.
6.  `getProposal`: Retrieves details of a specific proposal.

**Voting & Delegation (8 functions):**
7.  `castVote`: Casts or changes a user's vote (`Yes`, `No`, `Abstain`) for a proposal while it's `Superposed`.
8.  `changeVote`: Alias for `castVote` for clarity (allows changing vote).
9.  `delegateVote`: Delegates a user's *global* voting power to another address.
10. `undelegateVote`: Removes global delegation.
11. `delegateVoteForProposal`: Delegates a user's voting power for a *specific* proposal. Overrides global delegation for that proposal.
12. `undelegateVoteForProposal`: Removes delegation for a specific proposal.
13. `getEffectiveVotingPower`: Calculates the voting power of a user for a specific proposal, considering stake, reputation, and delegation. (View function)
14. `getVoteState`: Retrieves the recorded vote of a user for a specific proposal. (View function)

**Reputation & Stake (4 functions):**
15. `mintReputation`: (Privileged) Mints conceptual reputation for a user. Simulates earning reputation.
16. `burnReputation`: (Privileged) Burns conceptual reputation from a user. Simulates losing reputation.
17. `stakeTokens`: (Simulated) Increments user's staked token balance and total staked.
18. `unstakeTokens`: (Simulated) Decrements user's staked token balance and total staked.

**System Parameters (2 functions):**
19. `setParameter`: (Privileged or Governance) Sets a configurable system parameter (e.g., voting period).
20. `setAddressParameter`: (Privileged or Governance) Sets a configurable address parameter (e.g., for the execution condition target).

**Query Functions (6 functions):**
21. `getVoter`: Retrieves details of a specific voter. (View function)
22. `getCurrentParameters`: Retrieves the current system parameters. (View function)
23. `getProposalVoteResults`: Retrieves the calculated vote counts (Yes, No, Abstain) after a proposal has `Collapsed`. (View function)
24. `getProposalState`: Retrieves the current state of a proposal. (View function)
25. `getVoterReputation`: Retrieves a voter's current reputation. (View function)
26. `getVoterStake`: Retrieves a voter's current staked token amount. (View function)

**Internal Helper Functions:**
*   `_calculateWeightedVote`: Core logic for determining a user's weighted influence.
*   `_calculateQuorumRequirement`: Determines the dynamic quorum needed for a proposal.
*   `_resolveVoteState`: Processes all votes for a proposal during finalization.
*   `_execute`: Internal function to handle low-level calls for proposal execution.
*   `_checkExecutionCondition`: Internal logic to verify the execution condition using staticcall.
*   `_nonReentrant`: Basic reentrancy guard modifier.
