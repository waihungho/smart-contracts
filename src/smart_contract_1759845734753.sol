This smart contract, named **SynergyScoreNetwork**, introduces an advanced decentralized reputation and impact system. It enables users to issue verifiable attestations about each other, which contribute to a dynamic, non-transferable "SynergyScore." This score represents an individual's reputation and can be 'staked' to sponsor and vouch for decentralized initiatives or projects, creating a unique mechanism for community-vetted funding and collaboration. The system incorporates concepts of dynamic reputation decay, influence delegation, and on-chain dispute resolution.

### Function Summary:

**I. Core Attestation Functions:**
*   `issueAttestation(address _subject, bytes32 _dataHash, uint64 _expirationTime, AttestationType _type)`: Allows a user to issue an attestation (positive or negative) about another user. The `_dataHash` refers to off-chain data (e.g., IPFS).
*   `revokeAttestation(bytes32 _attestationId)`: Enables an attestation issuer to revoke their own issued attestation.
*   `updateAttestationData(bytes32 _attestationId, bytes32 _newDataHash)`: Allows an issuer to update the data hash of an attestation they issued, before it's used in score calculation.
*   `getAttestation(bytes32 _attestationId)`: Retrieves the full details of a specific attestation.
*   `challengeAttestation(bytes32 _attestationId, bytes32 _evidenceHash)`: Allows the subject of an attestation to formally challenge its validity, initiating a dispute.

**II. SynergyScore (Reputation) Functions:**
*   `requestSynergyScoreSnapshot(address _user)`: Triggers an on-demand recalculation and snapshot of a user's SynergyScore, considering all active attestations and decay.
*   `getSynergyScore(address _user)`: Retrieves the latest calculated SynergyScore for a user.
*   `delegateScoreInfluence(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to temporarily delegate a portion of their SynergyScore's *influence* to another address, for specific voting or sponsorship tasks.
*   `reclaimScoreInfluence(address _delegatee)`: Allows a user to reclaim previously delegated score influence from an address.
*   `getDelegatedInfluence(address _delegator, address _delegatee)`: Retrieves the amount of SynergyScore influence delegated from one user to another.

**III. Initiative Management Functions:**
*   `proposeInitiative(bytes32 _titleHash, bytes32 _descriptionHash, uint64 _submissionDeadline, InitiativeType _type, uint256 _requiredSynergyStake)`: Creates a new community initiative proposal, specifying its type and the minimum collective SynergyScore required for sponsorship.
*   `sponsorInitiative(bytes32 _initiativeId, uint256 _synergyAmount)`: Allows users to stake a portion of their available SynergyScore (or delegated influence) to sponsor an initiative, contributing to its validation.
*   `rescindSponsorship(bytes32 _initiativeId)`: Allows a sponsor to withdraw their SynergyScore stake from an initiative before the submission deadline.
*   `submitInitiativeOutcome(bytes32 _initiativeId, bool _success, bytes32 _reportHash)`: The initiative proposer submits a final report and declares the initiative's outcome (success/failure).
*   `voteOnInitiativeOutcome(bytes32 _initiativeId, bool _success)`: Sponsors of an initiative vote to confirm or dispute the proposer's declared outcome.
*   `resolveInitiativeOutcome(bytes32 _initiativeId)`: Finalizes an initiative's outcome based on sponsor votes, applying rewards or penalties to involved parties.
*   `getInitiativeDetails(bytes32 _initiativeId)`: Retrieves all details of a specific initiative.

**IV. Dispute Resolution Functions:**
*   `submitDisputeEvidence(bytes32 _disputeId, bytes32 _evidenceHash)`: Parties involved in a dispute can submit off-chain evidence hashes for review.
*   `voteOnDispute(bytes32 _disputeId, DisputeDecision _decision)`: Designated arbitrators or governance members vote on the resolution of an ongoing dispute.
*   `resolveDispute(bytes32 _disputeId)`: Finalizes a dispute based on arbitrator votes, applying consequences (e.g., attestation removal, score penalties).

**V. Protocol & Governance Functions:**
*   `setProtocolParameter(bytes32 _paramName, uint256 _value)`: Allows the governance body to update various configurable parameters of the protocol (e.g., score decay rate, dispute period).
*   `registerModule(address _moduleAddress, ModuleType _type)`: Registers a new external contract as a recognized module, enabling specialized functionalities (e.g., specific attestation types, advanced score calculators).
*   `updateAttestationWeight(AttestationType _type, uint256 _weight)`: Adjusts the influence weight of different attestation types on a user's SynergyScore.
*   `pauseContract()`: Pauses certain sensitive functions of the contract in an emergency.
*   `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract after an emergency.
