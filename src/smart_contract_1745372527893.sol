Okay, here is a smart contract proposal named `QuantumVault`. It attempts to incorporate a state-machine driven by (simulated) randomness, conditional access based on user "tiers", and complex temporal lock-ups with variable outcomes influenced by the vault's state at different points in time.

This contract is complex and intended as an *illustrative example* of combining advanced concepts, not a production-ready protocol. Key complexities include managing multiple states, simulating external randomness (Chainlink VRF would be used in production), handling different user access tiers, and calculating dynamic unlock amounts for temporal shards.

/**
 * @title QuantumVault
 * @dev A vault contract with dynamic state-dependent rules, conditional access, and temporal locks influenced by randomness.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. State Variables & Enums: Define the vault's state, user properties, parameters, and tracking for temporal locks.
 * 2. Events: Declare events for transparency on key actions.
 * 3. Modifiers: Custom modifiers for access control beyond Ownable.
 * 4. Constructor: Initialize the contract with owner and target token.
 * 5. Core Vault Operations: Deposit and standard withdrawal functions.
 * 6. State Machine Management: Functions to get current state, request state changes (simulated VRF trigger), and handle state transitions (simulated VRF callback).
 * 7. State Parameter Configuration: Functions for owner to set parameters for each state.
 * 8. User Access Tiers: Functions for owner to set user tiers and tiered withdrawal logic.
 * 9. Bonding Periods: Functions for users to set bonding periods and check their status.
 * 10. Temporal Shards: Complex mechanism for time-locked deposits with outcomes affected by state and randomness.
 * 11. VRF Simulation: Internal helper functions to simulate VRF interaction (replace with real VRF in production).
 * 12. Utility & Admin Functions: Get balances, total supply, pause state changes, emergency withdraw.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 * - `constructor`: Sets the contract owner and the ERC20 token address.
 * - `deposit`: Allows users to deposit the designated ERC20 token into the vault.
 * - `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw their non-locked balance, subject to bonding period and state-based fees.
 * - `setBondingPeriod`: Allows a user to commit to a minimum withdrawal lock-up time.
 * - `getBondingEndTime`: Returns the timestamp when a user's bonding period ends.
 * - `getCurrentQuantumState`: Returns the current operational state of the vault.
 * - `requestStateChange`: Initiates a request for the vault's state to potentially change, simulating a VRF request. Only callable if not already pending and not paused.
 * - `simulateVRFFulfillment`: INTERNAL/SIMULATION ONLY. Called after a VRF request to change the state based on a simulated random number. In production, this would be `fulfillRandomWords` from VRFConsumerBaseV2.
 * - `getStateParameters`: Returns the configurable parameters for a specific QuantumState.
 * - `setStateParameters`: Allows the owner to configure parameters (like fees, multipliers) for a given QuantumState.
 * - `getAccessLevel`: Returns the access tier for a specific user.
 * - `setAccessLevel`: Allows the owner to assign an access tier to a user.
 * - `withdrawTiered`: Allows withdrawal with rules potentially modified by the user's access tier and current state.
 * - `createTemporalShard`: Locks a specified amount for a future duration, creating a unique 'shard' whose unlock value will depend on vault states at lock and claim times, plus randomness.
 * - `getTemporalShardDetails`: Returns details of a specific Temporal Shard by its ID.
 * - `claimTemporalShard`: Allows the creator of a Temporal Shard to claim their funds after the unlock time. Calculates the final amount based on state conditions and random factors at lock and claim.
 * - `cancelTemporalShard`: Allows early cancellation of a Temporal Shard, potentially with a penalty.
 * - `getUserShardIds`: Returns an array of Temporal Shard IDs associated with a user.
 * - `getUserBalance`: Returns the user's standard withdrawable balance (excluding amounts locked in shards).
 * - `getTotalDeposited`: Returns the total amount of the ERC20 token held by the contract.
 * - `updateVRFConfig`: Allows the owner to update VRF-related configuration (simulated: placeholder).
 * - `getMinBondingPeriod`: Returns the minimum bonding period enforced by the contract.
 * - `setMinBondingPeriod`: Allows the owner to set the minimum bonding period.
 * - `transferOwnership`: Transfers ownership of the contract (from Ownable).
 * - `renounceOwnership`: Renounces ownership of the contract (from Ownable).
 * - `emergencyWithdrawOwner`: Allows the owner to withdraw all tokens in an emergency (use with caution).
 * - `pauseStateChanges`: Allows the owner to temporarily prevent state transitions.
 * - `unpauseStateChanges`: Allows the owner to resume state transitions.
 * - `getPendingVRFRequest`: Returns the ID of a pending VRF request (simulated).
 * - `isStateChangePaused`: Returns true if state changes are currently paused.

**Explanation of Key Concepts & Advanced Features:**

1.  **State Machine (`QuantumState`):** The contract exists in distinct states (`Stable`, `Fluctuating`, `Entangled`, `Collapsed`). Each state can have different rules for fees, multipliers, and benefits.
2.  **Randomness-Driven State Transitions (Simulated VRF):** The `currentQuantumState` is intended to change based on external, verifiable randomness. The `requestStateChange` and `simulateVRFFulfillment` functions mimic this process. In a real-world dapp, you would integrate with a VRF oracle (like Chainlink VRF) where `requestStateChange` calls the oracle and `fulfillRandomWords` (the renamed `simulateVRFFulfillment`) is the secure callback.
3.  **State-Dependent Parameters (`StateParameters` struct and mapping):** The behavior of core functions (like withdrawal fees, bonding requirements, and shard multipliers) is dynamically adjusted based on the `currentQuantumState`.
4.  **Conditional Access Tiers (`AccessLevel` and `withdrawTiered`):** Users can be assigned different access levels by the owner. The `withdrawTiered` function allows implementing withdrawal logic that provides benefits (like bonuses) based on both the user's tier *and* the current vault state.
5.  **Dynamic Bonding Periods:** The minimum bonding duration a user must commit to can be influenced by the current `QuantumState` via the `bondingPeriodMultiplierBPS`.
6.  **Temporal Shards:** This is a core complex feature. Users lock funds (`createTemporalShard`) for a set duration. The final amount they can `claimTemporalShard` is not just the principal. It's calculated based on:
    *   The vault's state *at the moment the shard was created*.
    *   The vault's state *at the moment the shard is claimed*.
    *   A `randomFactorAtClaim` which is derived from the latest randomness available from the state-changing VRF fulfillment. This introduces a layer of uncertainty and potential variability to the unlock value, making it "quantum" in the sense of state-dependent, non-deterministic outcomes.
7.  **Multiple Withdrawal Mechanisms:** Users have a standard `withdraw` function (affected by state fees and bonding) and a `withdrawTiered` function (affected by state, bonding, *and* user tier). Temporal Shard claims are a third distinct way to access locked funds with entirely different rules.
8.  **Configurability & Control:** The owner has functions to set state parameters, user access levels, minimum bonding periods, and pause/unpause state changes, allowing for dynamic protocol management.
9.  **Event-Driven Transparency:** Numerous events are emitted to track deposits, withdrawals, state changes, shard creation/claiming, etc., providing off-chain monitoring capabilities.
10. **Simulation vs. Reality:** It's crucial to remember the VRF parts are simplified simulations. A production contract needs a robust VRF integration to be truly non-deterministic and secure. The complexity of state changes influencing shard claims also requires careful testing and consideration of edge cases (e.g., what if no VRF state change happens between shard creation and claim?).

This contract demonstrates how to build intricate logic around state, time, access control, and randomness, moving beyond basic token or DeFi patterns.
