The `AetherMind` contract is designed as a decentralized, adaptable autonomous protocol, simulating an intelligent agent on the blockchain. It manages a treasury, makes strategic decisions based on external data feeds, and evolves its operational logic and goals through a sophisticated, reputation-weighted governance system. The core idea is to create a "self-improving" or "self-evolving" smart contract that can respond to dynamic conditions and community input, going beyond static predefined logic.

### **Contract: `AetherMind`**

**Outline & Function Summary:**

**I. Core Infrastructure & Access Control:**
*   **`constructor(address _initialGovernor, address _initialFeeRecipient)`**: Initializes the contract, sets the first governor and fee recipient. Starts the contract in a paused state for security.
*   **`pause()`**: Allows the primary governor to halt all critical operations of the contract in emergencies.
*   **`unpause()`**: Allows the primary governor to resume operations after a pause.
*   **`recoverMaliciousFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _recipient)`**: An emergency function for the governor to recover tokens that might get stuck in the contract or are compromised due to external protocol interactions (e.g., if a linked strategy module encounters an exploit).

**II. Governance & Protocol Evolution (Reputation-Weighted DAO):**
*   **`proposeGovernanceChange(address _newGovernor, string memory _description, uint256 _voteDuration)`**: Initiates a proposal to change the primary governor. Requires a minimum reputation score from the proposer and is subject to a reputation-weighted vote.
*   **`voteOnProposal(uint255 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: Enables any address with a reputation score to cast a reputation-weighted vote (for or against) on an active proposal.
*   **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes a successfully voted-on proposal once its voting period ends and quorum/majority conditions are met. This function handles the actual state change for various proposal types.
*   **`awardReputation(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`**: Allows the current governor to award reputation points to addresses for valuable contributions to the AetherMind ecosystem.
*   **`deductReputation(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`**: Allows the current governor to deduct reputation points from addresses for negative or malicious actions.
*   **`getReputation(address _addr)`**: A view function to query the current reputation score of a specific address.

**III. Dynamic Strategy & Module Management:**
*   **`proposeStrategyModule(address _moduleAddress, string memory _description, uint256 _voteDuration)`**: Proposes a new external smart contract (`IAetherStrategyModule`) that the `AetherMind` can integrate and utilize for its autonomous operations. Requires governance approval.
*   **`activateStrategyModule(uint256 _moduleId)`**: Activates a successfully proposed and voted-on strategy module, making it available for the `AetherMind`'s decision-making process.
*   **`deactivateStrategyModule(uint256 _moduleId)`**: Deactivates an active strategy module, effectively removing it from the `AetherMind`'s operational logic.
*   **`configureModuleParameter(address _moduleAddress, bytes32 _paramName, bytes memory _paramValue)`**: Allows governance to dynamically adjust specific internal parameters of an *already active* strategy module (e.g., changing risk tolerance, rebalancing thresholds within an investment strategy).

**IV. Data & Contextual Awareness (Oracle Integration):**
*   **`registerOracleFeed(address _oracleAddress, bytes32 _feedId)`**: Registers a new external oracle contract (`IAetherOracleFeed`) as a trusted data source for the `AetherMind`. Callable by the governor.
*   **`updateOracleData(bytes32 _feedId, bytes memory _data)`**: Allows a registered oracle to push the latest data updates to the `AetherMind`'s internal state.
*   **`configureDataWeighting(bytes32 _feedId, uint256 _weight)`**: Adjusts the perceived importance or influence of a specific data feed on the `AetherMind`'s decision-making process (e.g., giving more weight to price data over sentiment).
*   **`requestContextualInsight(bytes32 _queryHash, bytes memory _queryData)`**: Simulates the `AetherMind` querying for complex, aggregated insights (e.g., "market sentiment analysis," "volatility forecast") from registered insight-providing oracles, rather than just raw data.

**V. Autonomous Operation & Treasury Management:**
*   **`depositFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount)`**: Allows any user to deposit supported ERC20 tokens or native ETH into the `AetherMind`'s managed treasury.
*   **`withdrawFunds(address _token, uint256 _amount)`**: Enables the governor to withdraw specified amounts of tokens or ETH from the `AetherMind`'s treasury, typically after a governance proposal.
*   **`executeAutonomousAction(address _target, bytes memory _calldata)`**: An internal core function through which the `AetherMind` itself executes a pre-decided action (e.g., interacting with a DEX, lending protocol, or another DeFi primitive). This is called by `triggerDecisionCycle`.
*   **`triggerDecisionCycle()`**: A publicly callable function (by anyone, incentivizing keepers) that prompts the `AetherMind` to activate its "brain." It evaluates its current state, processes latest oracle data, consults active strategy modules, assesses performance, and potentially executes an `AutonomousAction`.
*   **`setPerformanceGoal(bytes32 _goalId, bytes memory _goalData)`**: Allows governance to set or update the high-level objectives or performance targets for the `AetherMind` (e.g., "maximize stablecoin yield," "track a specific index").
*   **`assessPerformance()`**: Allows the `AetherMind` to internally evaluate its performance against its defined goals. This function simulates a self-improvement loop, where past outcomes could influence future decision parameters (though simplified in this example).

**VI. Dynamic Fees & Incentives:**
*   **`setDynamicFeeConfiguration(uint256 _baseFeeBPS, uint256 _performanceFeeBPS, uint256 _reputationDiscountBPS)`**: Configures parameters for the dynamic fee structure charged by `AetherMind`, including a base fee, a performance-based fee, and potential discounts for high-reputation participants.
*   **`claimDynamicFee(address _token, address _recipient)`**: Allows the governor to claim accumulated fees from `AetherMind`'s operations for a specified token, sending them to a designated recipient.
