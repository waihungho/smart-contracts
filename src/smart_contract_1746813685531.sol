Okay, here is a smart contract in Solidity called `ChronoLock`. This contract acts as a decentralized, time-aware registry and execution engine. It allows scheduling various types of events, data releases, or function calls based on specific time conditions, dependencies, and even external proofs.

It incorporates several advanced concepts:

1.  **Multiple Event Types:** Handling different kinds of scheduled actions (data reveals, function calls, dependencies, proofs).
2.  **Time-Based State Transitions:** Events move through states (`Pending`, `Executed`, `Cancelled`, `Expired`, `ProofSubmitted`, `ProofFailed`) based on time and actions.
3.  **Dependencies:** Events can be configured to only become executable *after* another specific event has been successfully executed.
4.  **Proof-of-Action/Data:** Some events require submitting external data or proof *before* they can be executed, with a specific deadline for the proof itself. The contract verifies this proof at execution time.
5.  **Dynamic Data Locking:** Allowing data to be stored and retrieved only after a set unlock time.
6.  **Event-Specific Access Control:** Beyond contract ownership, individual events have owners who can perform specific actions (cancel, update time, transfer ownership, submit proofs).
7.  **Batch Processing:** Ability to execute multiple ready events in a single transaction.
8.  **Fees:** Optional fees for creating events.
9.  **Pausability:** Contract-level pause mechanism.
10. **Cleanup:** Functions for removing completed/expired events to manage storage costs (though actual cleanup requires gas).
11. **Historical Block Data Access:** Demonstrates accessing the timestamp of a past block number (with the caveat of Ethereum's state pruning limitations).

It aims to be distinct from simple time locks or vesting contracts by being a generic platform for scheduling diverse, conditional, and time-sensitive operations.
