/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Development & Deployment (AI-DAO)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant) and Modified by You
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO for collaborative AI model development, training, and deployment.
 * It incorporates innovative features like:
 *   - **AI Model Submission & Governance:** Members can submit AI models, which are evaluated and voted upon.
 *   - **Decentralized Data Marketplace Integration:** Allows the DAO to fund and access datasets for training, with provenance tracking.
 *   - **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) Mechanism:** Tracks contributions to model development and rewards contributors based on their impact.
 *   - **AI Model Licensing and Revenue Sharing:** Controls the licensing and distribution of deployed AI models, distributing revenue to DAO members based on contribution.
 *   - **AI Model Performance Monitoring & Automated Updates:** Integrates with prediction markets to evaluate AI model performance and trigger updates/retraining.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *   - `constructor(address _dataMarketplace, address _predictionMarket)`: Initializes the AI-DAO contract with the address of a data marketplace and a prediction market.
 *   - `submitModel(string memory _modelName, string memory _modelDescription, string memory _modelCodeURI)`: Allows a member to submit an AI model for consideration.
 *   - `voteOnModel(uint256 _modelId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote on submitted AI models.
 *   - `fundDataset(string memory _datasetName, uint256 _fundingAmount)`: Proposes and executes funding for specific datasets on the integrated data marketplace.
 *   - `reportContribution(uint256 _modelId, address _contributor, uint256 _contributionWeight)`: Allows members to report contributions to a specific model, weighing the contribution.
 *   - `allocateRewards(uint256 _modelId)`: Distributes rewards based on the recorded contributions to a winning AI model.
 *   - `licenseModel(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _licenseFee)`: Sets a license fee for accessing the specified AI Model.
 *   - `accessModel(uint256 _modelId)`: Function to allow access to the specified model (requires payment and validation).
 *   - `updateModelBasedOnPredictionMarket(uint256 _modelId)`: Updates a model based on data coming from the prediction market.
 *   - `getMemberWeight(address _member)`: Function to allow getting member's voting power

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clearer Structure:**  Improved organization with sections for Structs, Enums, State Variables, Events, Modifiers, Constructor, and Functions. This makes the contract easier to read and understand.
* **Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive NatSpec comments (`/// @title`, `/// @author`, `/// @notice`, `/// @param`, `/// @return`) explaining each function, state variable, and modifier. This is crucial for contract usability and auditability.
* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require()` statements to enforce preconditions and prevent unexpected behavior.  Provides informative error messages for debugging.
* **Event Emission:** Emits events whenever important actions occur (model submission, voting, approval, funding, etc.). This allows external applications to monitor the DAO's activity.
* **Modifiers:** Employs modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `onlyMember`, `modelExists`, `modelNotApproved`) to encapsulate common checks and improve code readability and security.
* **AI Model Struct:** A well-defined `AIModel` struct to store model metadata.
* **Contribution Tracking:**  Uses `Contribution` struct and `modelContributions` mapping to track contributions and their weights, enabling fair reward distribution.
* **Data Marketplace Integration (Example):**  Shows how to integrate with a hypothetical data marketplace to fund dataset acquisition. *Important: This is a simplified example.  Real-world integration requires careful design and security considerations*.  Includes a `fundDataset` function.
* **Prediction Market Integration (Example):** Demonstrates integration with a prediction market to monitor AI model performance and trigger updates.  Includes `updateModelBasedOnPredictionMarket` function.  *Important: This is a simplified example.  The specific data exchanged with the prediction market will depend on the prediction market's API.*
* **Revenue Sharing:** Includes `licenseModel` and `accessModel` functions to enable licensing of AI models and revenue sharing.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Reentrancy Protection:** While not explicitly implemented with reentrancy guards, the `allocateRewards` function, which involves sending ETH to multiple addresses, should be carefully reviewed for reentrancy vulnerabilities if more complex logic is added. Consider using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern and/or OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
    * **Gas Limits:** Be mindful of gas limits when iterating over arrays or making external calls. Consider pagination or other techniques to avoid out-of-gas errors.
    * **External Calls:** External calls (e.g., to the data marketplace or prediction market) should be carefully scrutinized and secured to prevent malicious contracts from exploiting vulnerabilities. Use `try/catch` blocks to handle potential errors from external calls.
    * **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized members can perform sensitive actions.
* **Voting Quorum:** Dynamic vote calculation based on voting quorum, calculated as a percentage of total members.
* **getTotalVotingPower** Function to return total voting power.

This is a solid foundation for building a complex and innovative AI-DAO. Remember to thoroughly test and audit your code before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider using formal verification tools for added security.  Good luck!
