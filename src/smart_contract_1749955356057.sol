Okay, let's create a complex, non-standard smart contract. How about a "Quantum Vault" that uses abstract "quantum state" variables and "entanglement points" to control complex, conditional unlock mechanisms, managed by an owner and multiple trustees, with features like temporary conditional withdrawals and emergency shutdown?

It's an abstract concept playing on physics terms, not actual quantum computing, but allows for interesting state-dependent logic beyond simple time locks or multi-sigs.

## Quantum Vault Smart Contract

### Outline & Function Summary

This contract provides a multi-faceted vault system allowing users or the contract owner to lock Ether and ERC-20 tokens under complex, programmable conditions. The unlocking mechanism is based on a combination of traditional time locks, abstract "Global Quantum Keys" managed by contract administrators, specific "Vault Quantum Conditions" set per vault that reference global keys, and "Entanglement Points" specific to each vault. It includes roles for owner and trustees, conditional withdrawal permissions, and emergency features.

1.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Vaults:** Containers holding ETH and tokens with specific unlock conditions.
    *   **Global Quantum Keys:** Contract-wide abstract state variables (`string` name -> `uint256` value) set by administrators.
    *   **Vault Quantum Conditions:** Conditions set *per vault* that require a specific Global Quantum Key to meet or exceed a certain `uint256` threshold for unlocking.
    *   **Entanglement Points:** A `uint256` value specific to each vault, potentially influencing unlock thresholds or requirements.
    *   **Trustees:** Addresses granted limited administrative privileges (e.g., setting Quantum Keys).
    *   **Conditional Permissions:** Ability for the owner/trustees to grant temporary withdrawal permissions for specific amounts/recipients even if the main vault conditions aren't met.

2.  **Roles:**
    *   **Owner:** Full control, can manage trustees, set global keys, create vaults, emergency shutdown.
    *   **Trustee:** Can perform specific, limited administrative actions (e.g., setting Quantum Keys).
    *   **Beneficiary:** Address designated to receive funds from a vault upon successful unlock/withdrawal.

3.  **Key Features (Functions):**

    *   **Vault Creation & Deposit:**
        *   `depositEther()`: Receive ETH into the contract (can be directed to a new vault).
        *   `depositToken(address token, uint256 amount)`: Receive tokens into the contract (can be directed to a new vault - requires prior approval).
        *   `createVault(address beneficiary, uint256 initialEntanglementPoints)`: Create a new, empty vault structure with initial parameters.
        *   `depositIntoVault(uint256 vaultId, uint256 ethAmount, address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenAmount)`: Deposit specific amounts of ETH/tokens into an existing vault.
        *   `transferVaultOwnership(uint256 vaultId, address newBeneficiary)`: Change the beneficiary of a vault (restricted).

    *   **Quantum State Management:**
        *   `setGlobalQuantumKey(string memory keyName, uint256 value)`: Set or update a Global Quantum Key (Owner/Trustee).
        *   `getGlobalQuantumKey(string memory keyName) view`: Get the current value of a Global Quantum Key.
        *   `setVaultQuantumCondition(uint256 vaultId, string memory conditionKey, uint256 threshold)`: Add/update a condition for a specific vault, linking it to a Global Quantum Key threshold (Owner/Trustee/Beneficiary?). Let's make it Owner/Trustee for complexity.
        *   `getVaultQuantumCondition(uint256 vaultId, string memory conditionKey) view`: Get a vault's specific quantum condition threshold.
        *   `updateVaultEntanglementPoints(uint256 vaultId, uint256 newPoints)`: Update a vault's Entanglement Point value (Owner/Trustee).

    *   **Unlock & Withdrawal:**
        *   `checkVaultUnlockConditions(uint256 vaultId) view`: Check if all conditions (time lock, quantum keys vs thresholds, entanglement points) for a vault are met.
        *   `tryUnlockVault(uint256 vaultId)`: Attempt to transition a vault's status to `Unlocking` or `Unlocked` if conditions are met.
        *   `withdrawFromVault(uint256 vaultId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Withdraw specific ETH (address(0)) or Token amounts *only if the vault is in a withdrawable state* (`Unlocking` or `Unlocked` or has valid conditional permission).
        *   `withdrawAllFromVault(uint256 vaultId)`: Withdraw all contents (ETH and tokens) from a vault if it's in a withdrawable state.

    *   **Conditional Permissions (Advanced):**
        *   `grantConditionalWithdrawalPermission(uint256 vaultId, address recipient, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount, uint256 durationSeconds)`: Grant a recipient permission to withdraw a *specific* amount of a *specific* token/ETH for a limited time, bypassing main unlock conditions (Owner/Trustee).
        *   `revokeConditionalWithdrawalPermission(uint256 vaultId, address recipient, address tokenAddress)`: Revoke a previously granted conditional permission (Owner/Trustee).
        *   `getConditionalWithdrawalPermission(uint256 vaultId, address recipient, address tokenAddress) view`: Check details of a conditional permission.
        *   `withdrawWithConditionalPermission(uint256 vaultId, address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows a recipient with valid permission to withdraw.

    *   **Administration & Emergency:**
        *   `addTrustee(address trustee)`: Add an address to the trustee role (Owner).
        *   `removeTrustee(address trustee)`: Remove an address from the trustee role (Owner).
        *   `isTrustee(address account) view`: Check if an address is a trustee.
        *   `pauseVault(uint256 vaultId)`: Temporarily pause withdrawal attempts for a specific vault (Owner/Trustee).
        *   `unpauseVault(uint256 vaultId)`: Unpause a vault (Owner/Trustee).
        *   `emergencyShutdown()`: Disable critical functions (withdrawals, state changes) permanently (Owner).
        *   `reclaimStuckTokens(address tokenAddress)`: Allow owner to recover tokens sent directly to the contract, not into a vault.

    *   **View/Utility:**
        *   `getVaultDetails(uint256 vaultId) view`: Get all struct details for a vault.
        *   `getVaultCount() view`: Get the total number of vaults created.
        *   `getVaultStatus(uint256 vaultId) view`: Get the current status enum of a vault.
        *   `getVaultTokenBalance(uint256 vaultId, address tokenAddress) view`: Get the balance of a specific token within a vault.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts & Functions:**

1.  **Abstract State-Based Unlocking (`GlobalQuantumKeys`, `VaultQuantumConditions`, `checkVaultUnlockConditions`):** Instead of just a time lock, unlocking depends on external, administrator-set "Quantum Keys" reaching certain thresholds defined *per vault*. This allows for highly flexible and dynamic unlock conditions that can react to off-chain data fed by privileged parties (simulating oracle influence without building a full oracle system) or internal contract state evolution. The separation between global keys and vault-specific conditions adds a layer of complexity and control.
2.  **Entanglement Points (`entanglementPoints`, `minEntanglementRequirement`, `updateVaultEntanglementPoints`):** An abstract concept representing a vault's "state quality" or "readiness". It adds another arbitrary parameter that can be factored into unlock conditions. The global minimum requirement means vaults might need to be "updated" or "maintained" (by updating points) to remain eligible for unlocking, creating a dynamic system.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (`Trustee`, `onlyOwnerOrTrustee`, `addTrustee`, `removeTrustee`):** Implements a multi-level admin structure beyond just the `Owner`. Trustees can perform specific actions (like setting Quantum Keys or managing specific vault states) without having full ownership control.
4.  **Conditional Withdrawal Permissions (`ConditionalPermission`, `grantConditionalWithdrawalPermission`, `revokeConditionalWithdrawalPermission`, `withdrawWithConditionalPermission`):** Allows administrators to grant temporary, specific withdrawal rights to any address for a certain amount of a token/ETH, *even if the main vault unlock conditions are not met*. This is useful for partial releases, emergency access, or implementing complex vesting schedules that might allow early partial unlocks under specific circumstances. This bypass mechanism adds significant flexibility.
5.  **Explicit Status Management (`VaultStatus`, `pauseVault`, `unpauseVault`, `emergencyShutdown`):** Vaults have distinct statuses (`Locked`, `Unlocking`, `Unlocked`, `Paused`, `Shutdown`). Administrators can pause vaults temporarily, and the owner can trigger a full, irreversible shutdown, providing circuit breaker functionality. The `tryUnlockVault` function specifically handles the transition to an `Unlocking` state *before* withdrawal is possible, separating the condition check from the funds transfer.
6.  **Vault-Specific Token Balances (`tokenBalances` mapping within `Vault` struct):** Tracks token balances per vault instance, rather than a single contract-wide balance. This is standard for vault patterns but essential for managing multiple distinct locked positions.
7.  **Structured Data Storage (`Vault` struct, mappings):** Using structs and nested mappings (like `conditionalPermissions[recipient][token]`) organizes complex, multi-dimensional data effectively. The `conditionKeysToMonitor` array is a necessary pattern to allow iterating over the keys in a mapping from Solidity (though it adds complexity in management).
8.  **Reclaim Stuck Tokens (`reclaimStuckTokens`):** A standard but crucial safety function for contracts that receive various tokens, allowing recovery of assets mistakenly sent directly without using a deposit function. (Note added regarding the limitation/risk in this demo implementation).

This contract goes beyond basic storage or transfer by introducing programmable, state-dependent unlocking logic managed by a multi-level administration, offering features like conditional access and emergency controls, making it a more advanced and less common pattern than simple DeFi building blocks.
