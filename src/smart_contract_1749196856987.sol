Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and somewhat "trendy" concepts, avoiding standard open-source templates.

This contract, provisionally named `QuantumVault`, acts as a secure vault for native blockchain currency (ETH) with complex, multi-stage withdrawal conditions driven by time, an external oracle, and administrator-controlled phases. It also includes features like dynamic fees, temporary balance locks, and signals for future states.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex contract example for educational and demonstration purposes. It has not been audited and should not be used in a production environment without rigorous security review and testing. Smart contract development carries significant risks.

// 10. View & Pure Functions: Functions to read contract state or perform calculations without changing state.

// --- Function Summary ---
// Admin & Control:
// - setManager(address newManager): Change the contract manager.
// - setOracle(address newOracle): Change the designated oracle address.
// - pause(): Pause user interactions (deposit/withdraw).
// - unpause(): Resume user interactions.
// - transitionToConditionPhase(): Move from DepositPhase to ConditionPhase. Requires time elapsed.
// - transitionToWithdrawalPhase(): Move from ConditionPhase to WithdrawalPhase. Requires oracle condition met.
// - transitionToCompletedPhase(): Move from WithdrawalPhase to CompletedPhase. Makes penalty pool claimable by admin.
// - emergencyWithdrawAdmin(): Allows manager to drain contract balance in case of extreme emergency (last resort).
// - setEarlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate(uint256 rate): Set the penalty rate for early withdrawals (bps).
// - setMinDepositLockDuration(uint256 duration): Set the minimum time deposits are locked.
// - setOracleConditionRequirement(bool requiredStatus): Set the boolean status the oracle must report for withdrawal phase entry.
// - lockUserBalanceTemporarily(address user, uint256 duration): Admin can temporarily lock a specific user's balance.
// - unlockUserBalance(address user): Admin can remove a temporary lock on a user's balance.
// - signalUpgradeAbility(): A non-binding function signalling potential future upgradeability.

// Oracle Functions:
// - submitOracleConditionResult(bool result): Oracle reports the status of the external condition.

// User Interaction:
// - deposit(): Users send native currency (ETH) to the vault. Requires DepositPhase.
// - withdraw(): Users attempt to withdraw eligible funds. Conditions must be met (phase, time lock, oracle status, temporary lock). Includes optional early withdrawal penalty.
// - claimAdminPenaltyPool(): Manager claims the accumulated penalty pool balance after the Completed phase.

// View & Pure Functions:
// - getCurrentPhase(): Get the current operational phase.
// - getUserDeposit(address user): Get a user's total initial deposit.
// - getUserEligibleBalance(address user): Get a user's current eligible balance for withdrawal.

// - getRequiredOracleCondition(): Get the required oracle condition status for withdrawal phase.
// - getMinDepositLockDuration(): Get the minimum deposit lock duration.
// - getEarlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate(): Get the early withdrawal penalty rate (bps).
// - getLockedUntil(address user): Get the timestamp until which a user's balance is temporarily locked by admin.
// - getPenaltyPoolBalance(): Get the current balance in the penalty pool.
// - getDepositTimestamp(address user): Get the timestamp of a user's deposit.
// - getPhaseStartTime(QuantumPhase phase): Get the start timestamp of a specific phase.
// - isWithdrawalPossible(address user): Check if a user meets all current conditions for withdrawal.
// - calculateEarlyWithdrawalPenalty(uint256 amount): Calculate the penalty for an amount based on the current rate. (Pure function).

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Multi-Phase State Machine (`QuantumPhase`):** The contract's behavior changes significantly based on its current `QuantumPhase`. This creates a structured lifecycle (Deposit -> Condition -> Withdrawal -> Completed) with specific entry and exit criteria for each phase, controlled by the manager and external factors (time, oracle).
2.  **Conditional Withdrawal Logic (`isWithdrawalPossible`):** Withdrawal is not automatic after a certain time. It's gated by a combination of conditions: the current phase, minimum deposit time lock, an external oracle's status, and potential temporary admin locks. This complex gating is a core feature.
3.  **Oracle Integration (Simulated):** The contract depends on an external oracle (`_oracleAddress`) to report a specific boolean condition (`submitOracleConditionResult`). This condition is a prerequisite for transitioning to the `WithdrawalPhase` and for users to successfully `withdraw`. This mimics dependency on real-world data or off-chain computation results.
4.  **Dynamic Parameters (`earlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate`, `minDepositLockDuration`, `requiredOracleCondition`):** Key operational parameters can be adjusted by the manager after deployment, allowing flexibility in response to changing conditions (market, policy, etc.).
5.  **Dynamic Fees (`earlyWithdrawalPenaltyRate`, `calculateEarlyWithdrawalPenalty`):** A penalty system is included for withdrawals (conceptually "early" or just based on an active rate), with the rate adjustable by the manager. Penalties accumulate in a separate pool (`_penaltyPoolBalance`).
6.  **Penalty Pool (`_penaltyPoolBalance`, `claimAdminPenaltyPool`):** Accumulated penalties are held separately. In this simplified version, they are claimable by the admin *only* after the `Completed` phase, providing a simple model for redistribution or recovery (could be extended for user distribution).
7.  **Admin Override Lock (`lockUserBalanceTemporarily`, `unlockUserBalance`, `_userLockUntil`):** The manager has the granular ability to temporarily prevent a *specific* user from withdrawing, adding an emergency or management layer beyond global phase controls.
8.  **Explicit Upgrade Signal (`signalUpgradeAbility`):** While the contract itself isn't truly upgradeable in this single file (requiring proxy patterns), including a function to signal intent is a practice seen in protocols planning future evolutions. It's a non-binding signal to users/integrators.
9.  **Custom Access Control & Roles (`_manager`, `_oracleAddress`, `onlyManager`, `onlyOracle`):** Defines specific roles with distinct permissions, going beyond simple `Ownable`.
10. **Detailed Error Handling:** Uses custom `error` types for clearer and more gas-efficient error reporting.
11. **Reentrancy Guard:** Includes the standard `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin for safety during external calls (`withdraw`, `emergencyWithdrawAdmin`, `claimAdminPenaltyPool`).
12. **Timestamp-Based Logic:** Heavily relies on `block.timestamp` for enforcing time locks and tracking phase durations.
13. **Explicit Deposit Function:** While `receive`/`fallback` could accept ETH, they are explicitly reverted to enforce deposits happen through the `deposit()` function, ensuring timestamp and amount tracking.
14. **Multiple View Functions:** Provides granular visibility into various state variables and calculated conditions (`isWithdrawalPossible`, `getLockedUntil`, etc.).
15. **Initial Parameters in Constructor:** Key parameters like oracle address, initial lock duration, and penalty rate are set upon deployment.
16. **Event Logging:** Comprehensive events are emitted for significant actions and state changes, crucial for off-chain monitoring and dApp integration.
17. **State Management:** Careful management of user balances (`_userDeposits`, `_userEligibleBalance`) and the separate `_penaltyPoolBalance`.
18. **Basis Point Calculations:** Uses basis points (bps) for the penalty rate, a common practice in DeFi for percentage-based calculations.
19. **Combined Conditions for Actions:** The `withdraw` and phase transition functions require multiple, distinct conditions to be met simultaneously.
20. **Dedicated Emergency Function:** Includes `emergencyWithdrawAdmin` as a last resort, highlighting planning for critical failure scenarios.

This contract provides a foundation that could be expanded upon for various use cases requiring phased access, external validation, and dynamic rule sets, such as complex vesting, escrow with conditions, or entry points for multi-stage protocol participation.
