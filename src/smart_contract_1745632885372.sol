Okay, let's design a complex, advanced, and creative smart contract. We'll create a "QuantumVault" â€“ a secure vault for holding ETH with advanced features like multi-party conditional release, dynamic time locks, delegated access, guardian incentives, and guarded external calls, designed to be highly configurable and auditable.

This contract is **highly complex** and uses several advanced concepts. It is provided for educational and illustrative purposes only. **DO NOT USE THIS CONTRACT IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT THOROUGH AUDITING BY SECURITY PROFESSIONALS.**

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract:** `QuantumVault`

**Description:** An advanced smart contract for securing and managing ETH deposits with sophisticated access control, time-based and conditional release mechanisms, multi-party guardian approvals, access delegation, guardian incentives, and the capability for guarded arbitrary external calls. It introduces concepts beyond standard multi-signature or time-lock contracts.

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables & Structs:** Definitions for core data storage.
2.  **Events:** Logging actions.
3.  **Modifiers:** Access control restrictions.
4.  **Constructor:** Initial setup.
5.  **Configuration Functions:** Owner controls global parameters.
6.  **Guardian Management:** Owner manages guardians and threshold.
7.  **Deposit & Basic Withdrawal:** Standard deposit and restricted withdrawal.
8.  **Conditional Release System:** Define, prove, and execute condition-based releases.
9.  **Withdrawal Request & Approval:** Multi-guardian approval flow for standard withdrawals.
10. **Time Locks:** Global default and user-specific time locks.
11. **Access Delegation:** Users delegate limited withdrawal rights.
12. **Guardian Incentives:** Fee accrual and claim for guardians.
13. **Guarded External Calls:** Multi-guardian approved execution of arbitrary calls.
14. **Emergency Functions:** Owner bypass for critical situations.
15. **View Functions:** Read-only access to contract state.
16. **Receive/Fallback:** Handling direct ETH transfers.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(address[] memory _initialGuardians, uint256 _initialThreshold)`: Initializes the contract, setting the owner, initial list of guardians, and the minimum approval threshold for guardian-controlled actions.
*   `updateVaultConfig(string calldata _paramName, uint256 _newValue)`: (Owner) Updates specific global configuration parameters like `withdrawalFeePercentage`, `defaultLockDuration`, `minLockDuration`, and `maxLockDuration`. Includes validation against defined maximums/minimums.
*   `setGuardianThreshold(uint256 _newThreshold)`: (Owner) Sets the minimum number of guardian approvals required for actions like approving withdrawal requests or guarded calls. Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the number of active guardians.
*   `setGuardian(address _guardian, bool _status)`: (Owner) Adds or removes an address from the list of active guardians.
*   `removeGuardian(address _guardian)`: (Owner) Convenience function to remove a guardian (calls `setGuardian(_guardian, false)`).
*   `depositETH()`: (Anyone, payable) Allows sending ETH to the vault. The amount is added to the user's balance and potentially triggers or extends a personal time lock based on the `defaultLockDuration`.
*   `withdrawETH(uint256 _amount)`: (User) Allows a user to withdraw their available ETH. Subject to personal time locks. Applies a `withdrawalFeePercentage` if configured, which accrues to guardian incentives. Cannot bypass conditional release requirements for funds linked to a conditional request.
*   `defineConditionalReleaseCriteria(bytes32 _conditionHash, address _oracleAddress, bytes32 _conditionId, bytes calldata _conditionParams)`: (Owner) Defines the criteria for a conditional release by linking a unique hash identifier (`_conditionHash`) to an external oracle contract (`_oracleAddress`) and its specific condition parameters (`_conditionId`, `_conditionParams`).
*   `proveExternalConditionMet(bytes32 _conditionHash)`: (Anyone) Calls the external oracle contract defined for `_conditionHash` to check if the condition is met. If the oracle returns true, updates the internal `conditionMetStatus` for that hash. Can only be called once successfully per condition.
*   `requestConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 _amount, bytes32 _conditionHash)`: (User or Delegatee) Initiates a withdrawal request for a specific amount contingent on `_conditionHash` being proven true. The requested amount is conceptually earmarked/locked for this request until released or cancelled. Requires the user's funds are not currently time locked.
*   `cancelWithdrawalRequest(uint256 _requestId)`: (User or Delegatee) Cancels an outstanding conditional withdrawal request, freeing up the earmarked funds for other actions. Can only be cancelled if the condition has not yet been met.
*   `releaseConditionalFunds(uint256 _requestId)`: (Anyone) Attempts to execute a conditional withdrawal request. Succeeds only if the linked condition (`conditionId` stored in the request, referring to `_conditionHash`) has been marked as met (`conditionMetStatus` is true) and the user's funds are not time locked. Applies withdrawal fee.
*   `requestWithdrawal(uint256 _amount)`: (User or Delegatee) Initiates a standard withdrawal request that requires guardian approval. This flow can be used to potentially bypass time/condition locks if guardians agree.
*   `guardianApproveWithdrawalRequest(uint256 _requestId)`: (Guardian) Approves a pending standard withdrawal request (`isConditional` is false). If the number of approvals reaches the `guardianThreshold`, the withdrawal is executed. Applies withdrawal fee.
*   `applyPersonalLockDuration(address _user, uint256 _duration)`: (User or Guardian) Sets or extends a personal time lock for a specific user's funds. User-applied locks are restricted by `min/maxLockDuration`. Guardian-applied locks bypass these bounds for flexibility (requires trust in guardians).
*   `delegateVaultAccess(address _delegatee)`: (User) Delegates the right to call `requestConditionalWithdrawal` and `requestWithdrawal` on their behalf to another address. Passing `address(0)` revokes delegation.
*   `revokeWithdrawalRightDelegation()`: (User) Revokes any active delegation.
*   `claimGuardianIncentives()`: (Guardian) Allows a guardian to claim their accumulated share of withdrawal fees.
*   `proposeGuardedCall(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data, uint256 _requiredApprovals)`: (Owner) Proposes an arbitrary external call using the vault's ETH. Requires a specific number of guardian approvals (`_requiredApprovals`) which can be set per call.
*   `approveAndExecuteGuardedCall(uint256 _callId)`: (Guardian) Approves a proposed guarded external call. If the number of approvals reaches the `requiredApprovals` set for the call, the external call is executed using funds from the vault.
*   `emergencyOwnerWithdraw()`: (Owner) Allows the owner to withdraw all ETH from the contract immediately, bypassing all other checks and mechanisms. Designed for emergency use.
*   `getVaultBalance()`: (View) Returns the total ETH balance currently held by the contract.
*   `getUserBalance(address _user)`: (View) Returns the recorded balance of a specific user within the vault mapping.
*   `getGuardianList()`: (View) Returns an array of addresses currently registered as active guardians.
*   `getWithdrawalRequestDetails(uint256 _requestId)`: (View) Returns details about a specific withdrawal request, including user, amount, type, condition ID, approval count, required approvals, and status.
*   `getConditionCriteria(bytes32 _conditionHash)`: (View) Returns the defined criteria (oracle address, condition ID, parameters) for a given condition hash.
*   `getConditionMetStatus(bytes32 _conditionHash)`: (View) Returns a boolean indicating whether the oracle has successfully proven the condition for a given hash.
*   `checkUserWithdrawalEligibility(address _user)`: (View) Returns true if the user has a balance and their personal time lock has expired. Does not account for pending requests or conditional releases.
*   `getGuardedCallDetails(uint256 _callId)`: (View) Returns details about a specific proposed guarded external call.
*   `getUserLockEndTime(address _user)`: (View) Returns the timestamp when the personal time lock for a user expires.
*   `getDelegatedAccess(address _user)`: (View) Returns the address currently delegated withdrawal rights by a user, or address(0) if no delegation exists.
*   `getGuardianIncentives(address _guardian)`: (View) Returns the amount of ETH incentives currently accrued for a specific guardian.
*   `receive() external payable`: (Anyone, payable) Default function to receive plain ETH transfers. Automatically calls `depositETH()`.

This contract incorporates several patterns and concepts:

1.  **Multi-Party Control:** Guardians approving actions (`guardianThreshold`).
2.  **Conditional Logic:** Releasing funds based on external truth via an `IConditionOracle` interface.
3.  **Time-Based Locks:** Both a default minimum and user-specific locks.
4.  **Access Delegation:** A user can grant limited control to another address.
5.  **Incentives:** Guardians are incentivized via a percentage of withdrawal fees.
6.  **Guarded Execution:** A highly controlled mechanism for the contract to interact with other protocols or perform upgrades using vault funds, requiring multi-guardian sign-off *per action*.
7.  **Request-Based Flow:** Some withdrawals require initiating a request before execution.
8.  **Configuration:** Owner can dynamically adjust certain parameters (within bounds).
9.  **Emergency Bypass:** A necessary escape hatch for the owner (though risky).
10. **Reentrancy Protection:** Using `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin.
11. **Clear Events:** Logging state changes for off-chain monitoring and auditing.

This is a foundational structure; a production system would require even more detailed error handling, edge case considerations, gas optimization, and extensive security audits.
