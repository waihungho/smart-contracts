/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation Marketplace (DRM)
 * @author AI Assistant
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized marketplace for reputation tokens.
 * It allows users to earn reputation by completing tasks or providing valuable contributions,
 * and spend reputation to access premium content, services, or features.
 * It introduces the concept of "reputation bonding curves" where the price of a reputation
 * token is dynamically determined based on supply and demand. It also features a reputation
 * delegation mechanism, allowing users to delegate their reputation to other users or contracts,
 * potentially boosting their influence or access levels.
 *
 *
 * Functions:
 *   - mintReputation(address _to, uint256 _amount): Mints reputation tokens to a specified address. Only callable by the contract owner.
 *   - burnReputation(address _from, uint256 _amount): Burns reputation tokens from a specified address. Only callable by the contract owner or the address being burned from.
 *   - getReputationBalance(address _user): Returns the reputation balance of a user.
 *   - setBondingCurveParameters(uint256 _basePrice, uint256 _supplyCoefficient):  Sets the parameters for the bonding curve calculation.  Only callable by the contract owner.
 *   - calculateReputationCost(uint256 _amount): Calculates the cost in ETH to purchase a specified amount of reputation tokens based on the bonding curve.
 *   - calculateReputationReturn(uint256 _ethAmount): Calculates the amount of reputation tokens a user receives for a given ETH amount based on the bonding curve.
 *   - buyReputation(uint256 _amount): Allows users to purchase reputation tokens using ETH.
 *   - sellReputation(uint256 _amount): Allows users to sell reputation tokens for ETH.
 *   - delegateReputation(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount): Delegates a portion of the user's reputation to another address.
 *   - revokeDelegation(address _delegatee, uint256 _amount): Revokes a delegation of reputation from another address.
 *   - getDelegatedReputation(address _delegator, address _delegatee): Returns the amount of reputation delegated from one address to another.
 *   - getTotalReputationPower(address _user): Returns the total reputation power of a user, including their own reputation and delegated reputation.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Function Summaries:**  Each function has a concise, informative `/** ... */` block explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.  This is crucial for readability and for tools that automatically generate documentation.

* **Bonding Curve Implementation:** The `calculateReputationCost` and `calculateReputationReturn` functions implement a basic bonding curve.  The price of reputation increases as the total supply increases, making early adoption more affordable and rewarding. The `basePrice` and `supplyCoefficient` parameters allow the contract owner to fine-tune the curve's behavior.  The implementation uses a simple, iterative approach for clarity.  More efficient (but potentially less readable) formulas could be used for production.  The calculations are designed to minimize rounding errors that can occur when using integer division.

* **Reputation Delegation:**  The `delegateReputation` and `revokeDelegation` functions allow users to grant their reputation to others. This enables interesting use cases like:
    * **Voting Power:**  Users can delegate their reputation to a representative or DAO for voting.
    * **Content Curation:**  Users can delegate their reputation to curators to signal the quality of content.
    * **Staking for Rewards:**  Reputation can be delegated to a staking contract to earn rewards based on the reputation weight.

* **`getTotalReputationPower` Function:** This function is essential for calculating the influence of a user, considering both their own reputation *and* reputation delegated *to* them. The use of `getDelegators()` function is used to get all users that delegate to a specified user, and then calculating the total reputation power to the user that receive the delegation.

* **`getDelegators` Function:** Returns an array of addresses that have delegated reputation to a specific delegatee.  It is used to retrieve a list of all users delegating to a given address.

* **`getUniqueAddresses` Function:** Returns an array of unique addresses holding reputation tokens. Prevents duplicates and accurately represents the token holders.

* **`getAllUsers` Function:** Return an array of all addresses, but this function is dangerous, expensive and should be avoided as much as possible.

* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Owner-Only Functions:** The `mintReputation` and `setBondingCurveParameters` functions are restricted to the contract owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier.
    * **Insufficient Balance Checks:**  The `burnReputation` and `sellReputation` functions check for sufficient balances to prevent users from burning or selling more reputation than they have.
    * **Prevent Delegation to Self:** The `delegateReputation` function prevents users from delegating reputation to themselves.
    * **Zero Address Checks:** The `mintReputation` and `delegateReputation` functions prevent minting to or delegating to the zero address.
    * **Re-entrancy Protection (Implied):** The contract, as written, is *relatively* resistant to re-entrancy attacks because state updates (balance changes) occur *before* any external calls (transfers).  However, in more complex contracts, re-entrancy protection is often explicitly implemented using a re-entrancy guard modifier.

* **Events:** All significant state changes (minting, burning, buying, selling, delegating, revoking) emit events.  These events are crucial for off-chain monitoring and indexing.

* **Gas Optimization:**  The provided code prioritizes readability and clarity over extreme gas optimization.  In a real-world deployment, you would need to analyze gas costs and potentially use techniques like:
    * **Using more efficient data structures.**
    * **Caching frequently accessed values.**
    * **Using assembly for computationally intensive tasks.**
    * **Limiting loop iterations when possible.**

* **Error Handling:**  Uses `require` statements extensively to enforce conditions and provide informative error messages.  This makes debugging easier.

* **Clear Naming:** Variable and function names are chosen to be self-descriptive.

* **Comments:**  The code is well-commented to explain the logic behind each step.

This is a much more complete and practical example of a reputation token contract with advanced features and better security practices.  Remember to thoroughly test any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment. Also, this solution has expensive, unsafe functions, you should be aware and implement the function on production with care.
