This smart contract, "QuantumLeap," ventures into the realm of **dynamic, evolving digital assets ("Digital Organisms") powered by verifiable off-chain computation (ZK-proofs), self-optimizing protocol liquidity, and gamified "quantum-inspired" mechanics.** It aims to create an ecosystem where NFTs are not static images or data, but truly programmable entities whose properties and behaviors can change based on external, provable events.

## QuantumLeap Smart Contract: Outline & Function Summary

**Concept:** QuantumLeap creates a new paradigm for NFTs, transforming them into "Digital Organisms" that can evolve, interact, and generate value based on external, verifiable computations. It integrates ZK-proofs for secure off-chain data integration, a self-optimizing treasury for protocol sustainability, and unique "quantum-inspired" mechanics like Superposition, Entanglement, and Teleportation to define novel asset behaviors.

**Core Pillars:**
1.  **Digital Organisms (ERC-721 based):** NFTs with dynamic traits, "energy," and "generation" that evolve.
2.  **Quantum Verifiable Computation (QVC):** Integration with off-chain zero-knowledge proof providers to enable trusted data input for organism evolution.
3.  **Self-Optimizing Protocol Treasury:** A treasury that intelligently reallocates funds based on market conditions and organism performance to maximize protocol sustainability and rewards.
4.  **Gamified Quantum Mechanics:** Metaphorical application of quantum concepts (Superposition, Entanglement, Teleportation, Mutation) to create unique on-chain interactions and behaviors.

### Function Summary:

**A. Digital Organism Management & Evolution (ERC721-Inspired):**
1.  `mintGenesisOrganism(address _to, string memory _tokenURI)`: Mints the very first Digital Organism, starting its lineage.
2.  `mutateOrganism(uint256 _organismId, bytes32 _proofHash, bytes memory _newTraitData)`: The core evolution mechanism. Allows an organism to mutate (change traits/properties) only after a valid ZK-proof (verified off-chain by a QVC provider) is submitted and proven.
3.  `mergeOrganisms(uint256 _organism1Id, uint256 _organism2Id)`: Allows two Digital Organisms to "merge," potentially combining traits or creating a new, more powerful organism, burning the originals.
4.  `splitOrganism(uint256 _organismId, uint256 _newOrganismEnergy)`: Allows a Digital Organism to "split," creating a new organism from its "energy" or traits, reducing the original's energy.
5.  `toggleOrganismSuperposition(uint256 _organismId, bool _inSuperposition)`: A conceptual state where an organism's true nature or value is uncertain until an action "collapses its waveform." Impacts its ability to participate in certain protocol functions.
6.  `updateOrganismEnergy(uint256 _organismId, int256 _energyDelta)`: Adjusts an organism's internal "energy" resource, crucial for actions and survival.
7.  `getOrganismState(uint256 _organismId)`: Retrieves the current comprehensive state of a Digital Organism.
8.  `getOrganismTrait(uint256 _organismId, uint256 _traitIndex)`: Retrieves a specific trait of an organism.

**B. Quantum Verifiable Computation (QVC) Integration:**
9.  `registerQvProvider(address _providerAddress)`: Allows the protocol owner to whitelist addresses that can submit ZK-proofs from off-chain computation.
10. `deregisterQvProvider(address _providerAddress)`: Removes a whitelisted QVC provider.
11. `submitQvProof(bytes32 _proofHash, uint256 _organismId, bytes memory _proofDetails)`: QVC providers submit a hash of their verified off-chain computation proof, linking it to an organism.
12. `challengeQvProof(bytes32 _proofHash)`: Allows for a dispute mechanism against a submitted proof (simplified for this example, would require a more complex arbitration).
13. `verifyProofForOrganism(uint256 _organismId)`: Triggers the internal verification check for a proof associated with an organism, allowing for mutation.
14. `requestQvComputation(uint256 _organismId, bytes memory _computationRequest)`: Allows an organism owner to formally request an off-chain computation related to their organism (e.g., environmental simulation).

**C. Protocol Treasury & Economics:**
15. `depositTreasuryFunds()`: Allows anyone to deposit funds into the protocol's self-optimizing treasury.
16. `setTreasuryOptimizationStrategy(TreasuryAllocationStrategy _strategy, address[] memory _assetAddresses, uint256[] memory _allocations)`: Sets the strategy and target allocations for the treasury.
17. `optimizeTreasuryAllocation()`: Triggers the treasury to reallocate its assets based on the set strategy and current market conditions (via oracle).
18. `distributeProtocolShare(uint256 _amount)`: Distributes a portion of the treasury's gains to stakers or organism holders (simplified).
19. `collectProtocolFees()`: Allows the protocol to collect accrued fees from various operations.

**D. Advanced & Quantum-Inspired Mechanics:**
20. `entangleOrganisms(uint256 _organism1Id, uint256 _organism2Id)`: Creates a conceptual "entanglement" between two organisms, meaning certain actions on one might affect the other.
21. `disentangleOrganisms(uint256 _organism1Id, uint256 _organism2Id)`: Removes the entanglement link between two organisms.
22. `teleportOrganismOwnership(uint256 _organismId, address _newOwner, bytes32 _conditionalProofHash)`: A conditional transfer of ownership, activated by a specific, pre-agreed ZK-proof, bypassing traditional `transferFrom` logic.
23. `batchMutateOrganisms(uint256[] memory _organismIds, bytes32[] memory _proofHashes, bytes[] memory _newTraitData)`: Allows for efficient mutation of multiple organisms in a single transaction.
24. `withdrawQvProofReward(bytes32 _proofHash)`: Allows a QVC provider to claim rewards for a successfully verified proof.

**E. Governance & Utility (Basic):**
25. `proposeProtocolParameterChange(bytes32 _proposalHash)`: Allows the owner to propose changes to core protocol parameters (e.g., fee structure, oracle address).
26. `executeProtocolParameterChange(bytes32 _proposalHash)`: Executes a pre-approved protocol parameter change.

**Disclaimer:** This smart contract is a conceptual demonstration. It contains advanced features and metaphorical "quantum" concepts that would require significant external infrastructure (ZK-proof systems, robust oracles, off-chain computation) and further development for real-world deployment. Security audits and extensive testing are paramount for any production-ready smart contract.
