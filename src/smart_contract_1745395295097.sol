Okay, let's create a smart contract with a creative and somewhat complex concept. We'll design a "Quantum Flux Vault" that holds assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) in distinct 'flux positions'. Each position has multiple, potentially complex, unlock conditions that can change dynamically based on simulated "quantum fluctuations" or external events triggered by an administrator (representing external oracles or complex state changes).

This concept avoids standard patterns like simple time locks, vesting, or single-condition escrows by introducing:
1.  **Multiple Asset Types:** Handling ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 within a single vault position.
2.  **Complex Conditional Unlocks:** Conditions can be time-based, dependent on contract state, or triggered by external events.
3.  **Conditional Dependencies:** Conditions can be combined using logical AND (requiring multiple conditions to be met).
4.  **Dynamic Conditions (Simulated Flux):** A mechanism (`triggerQuantumFlux`) that can alter the unlock conditions or introduce temporary locks, simulating unpredictable external factors or state changes affecting the vault positions.
5.  **Position Management:** Functions to create, add assets to, and query specific positions.

This will require careful state management and several functions to handle the different types of assets, conditions, and the "flux" mechanism.

### QuantumFluxVault Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Interfaces:** ERC20, ERC721 receiver.
2.  **Libraries:** SafeERC20.
3.  **State Variables:**
    *   Owner address.
    *   Counter for unique position IDs.
    *   Mapping from position ID to `FluxPosition` struct.
    *   Mapping from owner address to list of their position IDs.
    *   Mapping for simulated external events (`eventRegistry`).
    *   Internal state variables used for conditions (`internalStateTracker`).
4.  **Enums:**
    *   `ConditionType`: `TimeLock`, `StateMatch`, `EventTrigger`, `MultiCondition`.
5.  **Structs:**
    *   `UnlockCondition`: Type, parameters (uint256, address, bytes32 etc.), boolean status (met/not met).
    *   `FluxPosition`: Owner, asset holdings (mappings for ERC20/ERC721, uint for ETH), map of condition IDs to `UnlockCondition` structs, condition counter, boolean `isFluxLocked`, `lastFluxUpdate` timestamp.
6.  **Events:** For deposit, creation, withdrawal, condition changes, flux triggers, etc.
7.  **Modifiers:** `onlyOwner`, `isPositionOwner`, `isPositionUnlocked`.
8.  **Functions:**
    *   **Deployment & Setup:** `constructor`, `transferOwnership`.
    *   **Asset Deposit:** `receive()`, `depositERC20`, `depositERC721`, `onERC721Received`.
    *   **Position Management:** `createFluxPosition`, `addAssetsToPosition`.
    *   **Condition Definition:** `defineTimeLockCondition`, `defineStateMatchCondition`, `defineEventTriggerCondition`, `defineMultiCondition`.
    *   **Condition & State Updates (Admin/Flux):** `triggerQuantumFlux`, `resolveExternalEvent`, `updateInternalState`.
    *   **Status & Query:** `getFluxPosition`, `checkUnlockStatus`, `getPositionConditions`, `getOwnedPositionIds`, `getTotalERC20Held`, `getTotalETHHeld`.
    *   **Withdrawal:** `attemptWithdraw`.
    *   **Internal Helpers:** `_checkConditionMet`, `_checkUnlockStatusInternal`, `_withdrawERC20`, `_withdrawERC721`, `_withdrawETH`.
    *   **Emergency (Admin):** `emergencyWithdrawAdmin`.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract and sets the owner.
2.  `receive()`: Allows the contract to receive Ether directly.
3.  `depositERC20(address tokenContract, uint256 amount)`: Deposits a specified amount of an ERC20 token into the contract's general balance.
4.  `depositERC721(address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Deposits a specific ERC721 token into the contract's general balance. Requires the token to call `safeTransferFrom` to this contract.
5.  `onERC721Received(...)`: ERC721 receiver hook to handle incoming NFT transfers.
6.  `createFluxPosition()`: Creates a new, empty flux position and assigns it a unique ID. The caller becomes the position owner.
7.  `addAssetsToPosition(uint256 positionId, address erc20Contract, uint256 erc20Amount, address erc721Contract, uint256 erc721TokenId, uint256 ethAmount)`: Moves specified deposited assets (ERC20, ERC721, ETH) from the contract's general balance into a specific flux position. Requires the position to be owned by the caller and *not* currently locked by flux. (Note: ETH needs to be sent via `depositETH` or `receive` first if not sent directly with position creation, this function moves *from* contract balance). A variation could allow sending directly *to* a position. Let's make it move from contract balance for flexibility.
8.  `defineTimeLockCondition(uint256 positionId, uint256 unlockTimestamp)`: Adds a time-based unlock condition to a flux position, requiring the current time to be greater than or equal to `unlockTimestamp`.
9.  `defineStateMatchCondition(uint256 positionId, bytes32 stateKey, uint256 requiredValue)`: Adds a condition requiring a specific internal contract state variable (identified by `stateKey`) to match `requiredValue`.
10. `defineEventTriggerCondition(uint256 positionId, bytes32 eventIdHash)`: Adds a condition requiring a specific external event (identified by `eventIdHash`) to have been resolved by the admin.
11. `defineMultiCondition(uint256 positionId, uint256[] conditionIds)`: Adds a complex condition that requires *all* specified existing conditions within the same position (`conditionIds`) to be met simultaneously.
12. `triggerQuantumFlux(uint256 positionId)`: Admin function. Simulates a "quantum fluctuation" for a specific position. This function could, based on internal logic (or a simple random-like simulation based on block data), potentially:
    *   Temporarily set `isFluxLocked` to true.
    *   Modify parameters of existing conditions.
    *   Add temporary new conditions. (Implementation will be simplified, e.g., toggling a lock).
13. `resolveExternalEvent(bytes32 eventIdHash, bool success)`: Admin function. Marks a specific external event ID as resolved (e.g., true/false), potentially satisfying `EventTriggerCondition` instances.
14. `updateInternalState(bytes32 stateKey, uint256 newValue)`: Admin function. Updates an internal state variable, potentially satisfying `StateMatchCondition` instances.
15. `checkUnlockStatus(uint256 positionId)`: Public view function to check if all conditions for a given position are currently met and it's not flux-locked. Returns a boolean.
16. `getFluxPosition(uint256 positionId)`: Public view function to retrieve the details of a flux position (owner, asset lists, flux status, etc.). Does *not* reveal full condition details for gas reasons, use `getPositionConditions` for that.
17. `getPositionConditions(uint256 positionId)`: Public view function to retrieve the details of all unlock conditions attached to a flux position. Potentially gas-intensive for many conditions.
18. `getOwnedPositionIds(address owner)`: Public view function to get a list of all position IDs owned by a specific address.
19. `attemptWithdraw(uint256 positionId)`: Allows the position owner to attempt to withdraw all assets from a position. This function internally calls `checkUnlockStatus`. If unlocked, it transfers all held assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) to the owner and closes the position.
20. `getTotalERC20Held(address tokenContract)`: View function returning the total amount of a specific ERC20 token held *across all positions* and in the general contract balance.
21. `getTotalETHHeld()`: View function returning the total ETH held *across all positions* and in the general contract balance.
22. `emergencyWithdrawAdmin(address tokenContract, uint256 amount, address payable recipient)`: Admin function. Allows withdrawal of ERC20 in emergency.
23. `emergencyWithdrawERC721Admin(address tokenContract, uint256 tokenId, address recipient)`: Admin function. Allows withdrawal of ERC721 in emergency.
24. `emergencyWithdrawETHAdmin(uint256 amount, address payable recipient)`: Admin function. Allows withdrawal of ETH in emergency.
25. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Standard owner transfer.

**Explanation and Considerations:**

1.  **Complexity:** This contract is significantly more complex than standard patterns due to managing multiple asset types per position, dynamic conditions, and simulating external/internal state dependencies.
2.  **Gas Costs:** Iterating through mappings (e.g., in `getTotalERC20Held`) or arrays within structs (e.g., in `attemptWithdraw`, `getPositionConditions`) can become very expensive as the number of positions, conditions, or held token types grows. The `erc20TokenAddressesHeld` and `erc721TokenAddressesHeld` arrays help manage iteration costs in `attemptWithdraw` but add cost to `addAssetsToPosition`.
3.  **Security:**
    *   Reentrancy: Minimal risk with the current structure as token transfers happen *after* state updates, but always be cautious.
    *   Access Control: `onlyOwner` and `isPositionOwner` modifiers are used for critical functions.
    *   Emergency Withdrawal: Included as a necessary escape hatch for the owner in unforeseen circumstances.
    *   ERC721 `transferFrom`: Using `transferFrom` instead of `safeTransferFrom` in `_withdrawERC721` and `emergencyWithdrawERC721Admin` is less safe if the recipient is a contract that doesn't implement `onERC721Received`. A real-world contract might need a flag or check for this.
    *   Unchecked external calls: Standard token transfers are done via SafeERC20, reducing risk with ERC20 return values. ETH transfers use `call{value: amount}("")` which is the recommended pattern.
4.  **"Quantum Flux" Simulation:** The `triggerQuantumFlux` function is a simplified simulation. In a real dApp, this could be tied to external oracle data, a complex state calculation, or even a pseudo-randomness source (though true on-chain randomness is tricky). The current implementation simply toggles a boolean lock and updates a timestamp.
5.  **Condition Management:** Adding conditions is separate from creation for flexibility. Conditions are checked recursively in `_checkConditionMet`. Deleting conditions isn't implemented but would be necessary in a production system. Clearing condition IDs upon withdrawal is crucial to prevent re-checking old conditions on a closed position.
6.  **State Management:** ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 balances are tracked within each position's struct. Managing the arrays of held token addresses is necessary for efficient withdrawal iteration.
7.  **Non-Duplication:** While it uses standard interfaces (ERC20, ERC721) and common patterns (Ownable), the core concept of multi-asset, complex/dynamic conditional unlocking tied to simulated flux/state changes in this specific combination is not a standard open-source contract type like a simple escrow, vesting contract, or typical yield vault.

This contract provides a framework for a complex, state-dependent asset vault with a touch of dynamic unpredictability (controlled by the owner) for educational or creative purposes. Remember that deploying such a complex contract on a live network requires thorough auditing and gas optimization.
