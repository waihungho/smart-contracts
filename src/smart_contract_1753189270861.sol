This smart contract, "QuantumLeap DAO," is designed to be an advanced, future-facing decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding and nurturing innovative, high-risk, high-reward "Quantum Leap" projects. It integrates a novel blend of token-based and reputation-based governance, AI-assisted decision-making (simulated for on-chain Solidity), dynamic project funding with milestones, and a unique Soulbound Project NFT for successful contributors.

## QuantumLeap DAO: A Glimpse into the Future of Decentralized Innovation

**Outline:**

1.  **Core Mechanics:** The foundational components of the DAO, including its native token (`QBIT`), a vote-escrowed version (`veQBIT`), and a reputation system.
2.  **Reputation System:** A non-transferable score reflecting a member's contributions, integrity, and expertise.
3.  **Governance System:** How proposals are submitted, voted on, and executed, incorporating both `veQBIT` and reputation.
4.  **AI-Assisted Decisioning (Simulated):** Functions that simulate interaction with an off-chain AI oracle for insights, with on-chain validation.
5.  **Dynamic Project Funding & Milestones:** A sophisticated system for proposing, funding, evaluating, and rewarding ambitious projects.
6.  **Treasury Management & Revenue Sharing:** How the DAO manages its funds and distributes benefits.
7.  **Adaptive Security & Upgradability:** Mechanisms for responding to emergencies and facilitating future protocol evolution.
8.  **Specialized Features:** Unique functions like Sybil defense parameters and "flash governance."

---

**Function Summary:**

**I. Core Mechanics (Token & Vote-Escrow)**

1.  `constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol)`: Initializes the DAO, deploys the `QBIT` token, and sets initial parameters.
2.  `lockQBITForVoting(uint256 _amount, uint256 _unlockTime)`: Locks `QBIT` tokens for a specified duration to gain `veQBIT` (vote-escrowed QBIT). Longer locks yield more voting power.
3.  `extendLockDuration(uint256 _newUnlockTime)`: Extends the lock period for existing `veQBIT` tokens, increasing effective voting power.
4.  `withdrawLockedQBIT()`: Allows users to withdraw their `QBIT` tokens after their lock duration has expired.
5.  `getVotes(address _account)`: Returns the current voting power of an account, calculated based on `veQBIT` and reputation score.

**II. Reputation System**

6.  `earnReputationPoints(address _member, uint256 _points, string memory _reasonHash)`: Awards reputation points to a member for positive contributions (e.g., successful project delivery, valuable proposal support, accurate AI validation).
7.  `slashReputationPoints(address _member, uint256 _points, string memory _reasonHash)`: Deducts reputation points for malicious behavior or failed obligations, requiring a DAO vote.
8.  `getReputationScore(address _member)`: Retrieves the current reputation score of a specific DAO member.

**III. Governance System**

9.  `submitProposal(bytes memory _calldata, string memory _description, bytes32 _proposalHash)`: Allows members to submit new proposals for DAO action, requiring a minimum `veQBIT` and/or reputation threshold.
10. `voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Members cast their vote (for or against) on an active proposal, with their voting power derived from `veQBIT` and reputation.
11. `queueProposalForExecution(uint256 _proposalId)`: Moves a successfully voted-on proposal into a time-locked queue before it can be executed.
12. `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes the actions defined in a queued proposal after its timelock has passed.
13. `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the DAO (via a separate vote or high-authority decision) to cancel a pending or queued proposal.

**IV. AI-Assisted Decisioning (Simulated)**

14. `requestAIInsight(string memory _queryHash)`: Simulates requesting an insight from a sophisticated off-chain AI oracle (e.g., for risk assessment, trend analysis). The DAO expects an `AIInsightResult` to be reported back.
15. `reportAIInsight(bytes32 _queryId, AIInsightResult _result)`: A designated oracle or multi-sig reports the simulated AI's conclusion back to the contract, linking it to the query.
16. `validateAIInsightAccuracy(bytes32 _queryId, bool _wasAccurate)`: DAO members can vote on the accuracy of reported AI insights, potentially influencing the AI's future weight in governance or its "reputation."

**V. Dynamic Project Funding & Milestones**

17. `proposeResearchProject(string memory _projectTitle, string memory _descriptionHash, address _projectLead, uint256[] memory _milestoneAmounts, uint256[] memory _milestoneDeadlines)`: Initiates a new "Quantum Leap" project proposal, outlining milestones and their funding.
18. `fundProjectMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`: Releases funds for a specific project milestone upon successful DAO evaluation and vote.
19. `submitProjectProgress(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, string memory _progressReportHash)`: The project lead submits a report for a milestone, triggering DAO review.
20. `evaluateProjectProgress(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, bool _passed)`: DAO members vote to confirm if a project milestone has been successfully met, impacting project funding and lead reputation.
21. `mintProjectNFT(uint256 _projectId, address _recipient)`: Mints a unique, non-transferable Soulbound Project NFT to the project lead(s) upon successful completion of a "Quantum Leap" project.

**VI. Treasury Management & Revenue Sharing**

22. `depositToTreasury()`: Allows any member to contribute funds (e.g., ETH, wrapped tokens) to the DAO treasury.
23. `proposeTreasuryInvestment(address _targetAsset, uint256 _amount, string memory _strategyHash)`: Proposes a specific investment or staking strategy for treasury funds.
24. `executeTreasuryInvestment(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a DAO-approved treasury investment.
25. `claimRevenueShare()`: Allows members to claim a share of the DAO's generated revenue (e.g., from investments, fees) proportional to their `veQBIT` and reputation.

**VII. Adaptive Security & Upgradability**

26. `setEmergencyMode(bool _isEmergency)`: Activates or deactivates an emergency pause mode for critical functions, requiring a high-threshold governance vote or pre-approved guardian.
27. `proposeProtocolUpgrade(address _newImplementation)`: Allows the DAO to propose and vote on a new implementation contract for future upgrades (conceptualizes a proxy pattern).
28. `updateTrustedContractAddress(bytes32 _role, address _newAddress)`: Enables the DAO to update addresses of trusted external contracts (e.g., a new AI oracle, a new treasury management module) through governance.

**VIII. Specialized Features**

29. `setSybilDefenseThresholds(uint256 _minQBIT, uint256 _minReputation, uint256 _minLockTime)`: Allows the DAO to dynamically adjust the minimum thresholds for participation in sensitive activities (e.g., submitting proposals, flash votes) to combat Sybil attacks.
30. `initiateFlashGovernanceVote(bytes memory _calldata, string memory _description)`: For extremely time-sensitive decisions, initiates a rapid-response vote with significantly higher `veQBIT` and reputation thresholds and a shorter voting period.
31. `distributeQuadraticGrantPool(uint256 _grantPoolId, address[] memory _recipients, uint256[] memory _matchingFunds)`: Manages and distributes funds from a quadratic funding pool, allowing the DAO to support diverse community initiatives based on broad support, not just large capital holders.
