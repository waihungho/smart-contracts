 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Bard (Conceptual Example)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling collaborative art creation,
 * curation, and exhibition, governed by its members. This contract incorporates advanced concepts like
 * dynamic art project stages, on-chain voting for various decisions, decentralized curation, and
 * even experimental features like generative art integration and fractional ownership of collective art.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Membership & Roles:**
 * 1. `requestMembership()`: Allows an address to request membership to the collective.
 * 2. `approveMembership(address _applicant)`: DAO-controlled function to approve a membership request.
 * 3. `revokeMembership(address _member)`: DAO-controlled function to revoke membership.
 * 4. `isMember(address _address)`: Checks if an address is a member of the collective.
 * 5. `getMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 * 6. `setDAOController(address _newController)`:  Function to change the DAO controller address (governance).
 * 7. `getDAOController()`: Returns the address of the current DAO controller.
 *
 * **Art Project Management:**
 * 8. `proposeArtProject(string memory _title, string memory _description, uint256 _targetContributors, uint256 _contributionDeadline)`: Allows members to propose new art projects.
 * 9. `voteOnArtProjectProposal(uint256 _projectId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on art project proposals.
 * 10. `contributeToArtProject(uint256 _projectId, string memory _contributionData)`: Members can contribute to approved art projects.
 * 11. `finalizeArtProject(uint256 _projectId)`: DAO-controlled function to finalize an art project after contributions.
 * 12. `rejectArtProjectProposal(uint256 _projectId)`: DAO-controlled function to reject an art project proposal.
 * 13. `getArtProjectDetails(uint256 _projectId)`: Retrieves details of a specific art project.
 * 14. `getArtProjectStage(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns the current stage of an art project.
 * 15. `getProjectContributorCount(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns the number of contributors to a project.
 * 16. `getProjectContributions(uint256 _projectId)`: Returns all contributions for a project (for admin/DAO use).
 *
 * **Exhibition & Curation:**
 * 17. `proposeExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256[] memory _projectIds)`: Allows members to propose exhibitions featuring completed art projects.
 * 18. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 19. `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: DAO-controlled function to start an approved exhibition.
 * 20. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: DAO-controlled function to end an ongoing exhibition.
 * 21. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition.
 * 22. `getExhibitionProjects(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns the art projects included in an exhibition.
 *
 * **Experimental & Advanced Features:**
 * 23. `generateArtHash(uint256 _projectId, string memory _seed)`: (Experimental) Function to generate a deterministic art hash based on project data and seed (concept for generative art).
 * 24. `mintFractionalOwnershipNFT(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: (Experimental) Mints fractional ownership NFTs for a finalized art project (ERC1155 concept).
 * 25. `transferFractionalNFT(uint256 _nftId, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: (Experimental) Transfers fractional NFTs.
 * 26. `purchaseFractionalNFT(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _amount)`: (Experimental) Allows purchasing fractional NFTs from the contract.
 * 27. `withdrawCollectiveFunds()`: DAO-controlled function to withdraw funds collected by the collective.
 * 28. `getCollectiveBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective.
 * 29. `pauseContract()`: DAO-controlled function to pause core contract functionalities.
 * 30. `unpauseContract()`: DAO-controlled function to unpause core contract functionalities.
