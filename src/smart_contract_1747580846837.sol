Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract named `QuantumOracleSettlement`.

This contract is designed as a platform for settling outcomes of complex, uncertain, or future events based on a decentralized oracle system with a dispute mechanism. The "Quantum" aspect is conceptual, framing the idea of events existing in a state of potential outcomes until "observed" (reported by oracles) and settled. It incorporates several advanced concepts like multi-party staking on different outcomes, an oracle network with bonding and slashing, a multi-stage settlement process, and a built-in dispute resolution flow.

It aims to be distinct from standard DeFi protocols, token contracts, or simple multisigs by focusing on event-driven conditional settlement with robust oracle and dispute layers.

**Outline & Function Summary**

**Contract:** `QuantumOracleSettlement`

**Description:** A platform for creating, staking on, and settling the outcomes of uncertain future events via a bonded decentralized oracle network with a dispute resolution mechanism.

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Events:** Defined future occurrences with multiple potential outcomes.
*   **Staking:** Users lock funds/tokens on specific outcomes they believe will occur.
*   **Oracles:** Bonded participants who report the observed outcome of an event at the settlement time.
*   **Consensus:** Multiple oracle reports are required to determine a preliminary outcome.
*   **Dispute:** Users can challenge an oracle report during a dispute window, requiring a bond.
*   **Settlement:** Funds are distributed proportionally to stakers of the final, verified winning outcome, minus a protocol fee.
*   **Slashing:** Oracle bonds are slashed if their report is successfully disputed.

**Enums:**
*   `EventState`: Represents the lifecycle of an event (Proposed, Active, Settling, Disputing, Settled, Cancelled).

**Structs:**
*   `OutcomeDetails`: Stores description and total stake for a specific outcome within an event.
*   `Event`: Represents a single event with details, outcomes, state, timelines, etc.
*   `Oracle`: Represents a registered oracle with their bond amount.
*   `OracleReport`: Stores details of an oracle's report for a specific event.

**State Variables:**
*   `manager`: Address with special permissions (e.g., approving events, setting parameters).
*   `eventCounter`: Unique identifier for new events.
*   `events`: Mapping from event ID to `Event` struct.
*   `stakes`: Mapping from event ID -> staker address -> outcome ID -> staked amount.
*   `oracleRegistry`: Mapping from oracle address to `Oracle` struct.
*   `oracleReports`: Mapping from event ID -> oracle address -> `OracleReport` struct.
*   `outcomeReportCounts`: Mapping from event ID -> reported outcome ID -> count of oracles reporting this outcome.
*   `eventReportMajority`: Mapping from event ID -> outcome ID reported by majority.
*   `disputes`: Mapping from event ID -> disputer address -> dispute bond amount.
*   `slashedFunds`: Total amount of slashed oracle bonds awaiting withdrawal by the manager.
*   `protocolFees`: Total collected protocol fees awaiting withdrawal by the manager.
*   `minOracleBondAmount`: Minimum bond required for an oracle.
*   `disputeBondAmount`: Bond required to dispute an outcome report.
*   `oracleReportingWindow`: Duration for oracles to report after settlement time.
*   `disputePeriod`: Duration for users to dispute after oracle reports are processed.
*   `protocolFeeBips`: Protocol fee percentage in basis points (10000 = 100%).

**Events:**
*   `EventProposed`: Emitted when a new event is proposed.
*   `EventApproved`: Emitted when an event is approved.
*   `EventCancelled`: Emitted when an event is cancelled.
*   `OutcomeStaked`: Emitted when a user stakes on an outcome.
*   `StakeWithdrawn`: Emitted when a user withdraws stake before settlement.
*   `SettlementClaimed`: Emitted when a user claims their payout.
*   `OracleRegistered`: Emitted when an oracle is registered.
*   `OracleBonded`: Emitted when an oracle adds to their bond.
*   `OutcomeReported`: Emitted when an oracle reports an outcome.
*   `OracleReportProcessed`: Emitted when oracle reports for an event are processed.
*   `DisputeInitiated`: Emitted when an outcome report is disputed.
*   `DisputeResolved`: Emitted when a dispute is resolved.
*   `EventSettled`: Emitted when an event is finalized and settled.
*   `OracleSlashed`: Emitted when an oracle is slashed.
*   `ProtocolFeeUpdated`: Emitted when protocol fee is updated.
*   `ParametersUpdated`: Emitted when other parameters are updated.
*   `ManagerUpdated`: Emitted when the manager address is changed.

**Functions (28 total):**

**Event Management:**
1.  `proposeEvent(string description, bytes32[] outcomeIds, string[] outcomeDescriptions, uint256 stakingEndTime, uint256 settlementTime)`: Proposes a new event. Callable by anyone.
2.  `approveEvent(uint256 eventId)`: Approves a proposed event, changing state to Active. Only manager.
3.  `rejectEvent(uint256 eventId)`: Rejects a proposed event, changing state to Cancelled. Only manager.
4.  `cancelEvent(uint256 eventId)`: Cancels an active event (only before staking ends). Returns staked funds. Only manager.
5.  `getEventDetails(uint256 eventId)`: Get detailed information about an event.
6.  `getEventState(uint256 eventId)`: Get the current state of an event.
7.  `getAllEventIds()`: Get a list of all known event IDs.

**Staking & Payouts:**
8.  `stakeOnOutcome(uint256 eventId, bytes32 outcomeId)`: Stake funds (ETH or other value sent with call) on a specific outcome.
9.  `withdrawStake(uint256 eventId, bytes32 outcomeId, uint256 amount)`: Withdraw stake before staking end time if event is active/proposed.
10. `claimSettlementPayout(uint256 eventId)`: Claim payout for a settled event if the user staked on the winning outcome.
11. `getUserStake(uint256 eventId, address user, bytes32 outcomeId)`: Get the amount a specific user has staked on an outcome for an event.
12. `getTotalStakeForOutcome(uint256 eventId, bytes32 outcomeId)`: Get the total amount staked across all users for a specific outcome.
13. `getTotalStakeForEvent(uint256 eventId)`: Get the total amount staked for an entire event.

**Oracle Management & Reporting:**
14. `registerOracle()`: Register the caller's address as a potential oracle. Requires initial bond via `bondOracle`.
15. `bondOracle()`: Add to the caller's oracle bond. Sends ETH with the call.
16. `reportOutcome(uint256 eventId, bytes32 outcomeId)`: Oracles report the observed outcome for a settling event within the reporting window. Requires oracle bond >= min bond.

**Settlement Process:**
17. `initiateSettlement(uint256 eventId)`: Initiates the settlement process for an event after its settlement time. Changes state to Settling and opens the reporting window. Callable by anyone.
18. `processOracleReports(uint256 eventId)`: Processes submitted oracle reports, determines the majority outcome if consensus reached. Changes state to Disputing. Callable by anyone after reporting window ends.
19. `disputeOutcomeReport(uint256 eventId, bytes32 disputedOutcomeId)`: Initiate a dispute against the majority reported outcome. Requires a dispute bond. Only callable during the dispute period.

21. `finalizeSettlement(uint256 eventId)`: Finalizes settlement and enables payout claims if no dispute occurred or dispute is resolved. Changes state to Settled. Callable by anyone after dispute period ends (if no dispute) or after manager resolves dispute. *Note: This function name replaces `settleEvent` for clarity in the multi-step process.*

*(Self-correction during outline: Added `finalizeSettlement` to separate processing reports/resolving disputes from enabling claims. Added specific withdraw functions for manager. Reached 29 functions, more than 20.)*
