/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, showcasing advanced concepts and creative functionalities.
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  Art NFT Management:
 *     - mintArtNFT: Mints a new artwork NFT.
 *     - transferArtNFT: Allows NFT owners to transfer their artworks.
 *     - setArtworkPrice: Artists can set the price for their artworks for direct sale.
 *     - burnArtNFT: Allows artist to burn their own NFT under certain conditions.
 *     - getArtworkDetails: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork NFT.
 *
 * 2.  Gallery Curation & Exhibitions:
 *     - proposeArtworkForGallery: Users can propose artworks to be included in the gallery.
 *     - voteOnArtworkProposal: Gallery members can vote on proposed artworks.
 *     - addArtworkToGallery: Adds an approved artwork to the gallery collection.
 *     - createExhibition: Creates a curated exhibition within the gallery.
 *     - addArtworkToExhibition: Adds existing gallery artworks to a specific exhibition.
 *     - removeArtworkFromExhibition: Removes artwork from an exhibition.
 *     - endExhibition: Ends an ongoing exhibition.
 *     - getRandomArtworkFromExhibition: Retrieves a random artwork from a specific exhibition (for discovery).
 *
 * 3.  Dynamic Art Features:
 *     - evolveArtworkStyle: Allows artists to evolve the style of their artwork (e.g., through on-chain randomness or community votes - simplified here).
 *     - revealRandomFeature:  Reveals a hidden, randomly generated feature of an artwork NFT.
 *
 * 4.  Community & Governance:
 *     - createArtistProfile: Allows artists to create a profile with details.
 *     - createUserProfile: Allows users to create a general profile.
 *     - postCommentOnArtwork: Users can post comments on artworks.
 *     - likeArtwork: Users can like artworks (simple social interaction).
 *     - proposeGalleryParameterChange:  Governance mechanism to propose changes to gallery parameters (e.g., curation threshold).
 *     - voteOnParameterChange: Gallery members vote on parameter change proposals.
 *     - executeParameterChange: Executes approved parameter changes.
 *
 * 5.  Utility & Randomness:
 *     - getGalleryParameters: Retrieves current gallery parameters.
 *     - getRandomNumber:  Utility function to generate a pseudo-random number within a range (for evolving styles, random features, etc.).

    // - Layered access control for different roles (curators, artists, members, etc.).
    // - More complex governance mechanisms (quadratic voting, delegated voting).
    // - Integration with decentralized storage solutions for artwork metadata and images.
