The AetherMind Protocol (AMP) is a decentralized platform designed to foster collaborative and incentivized AI model development and data curation. It envisions a future where the creation and refinement of AI models are driven by a global community, leveraging on-chain reputation, staking, and decentralized governance. Participants earn rewards and build reputation by contributing high-quality datasets and effective AI model proposals, validated through community voting and trusted AI evaluation oracles.

## AetherMind Protocol (AMP) - Smart Contract Outline

**Contract Name:** `AetherMindProtocol`

**Core Purpose:** To establish a decentralized, incentivized ecosystem for AI model development and data curation, integrating on-chain reputation, staking, governance, and oracle-based AI evaluation.

### I. Core Token & Staking Functionality
*   **AMP Token:** An ERC-20 compliant token integrated within the contract for utility, staking, and rewards.
*   **Staking:** Allows users to lock AMP tokens to participate in the protocol, earn general staking rewards, and gain voting power.
*   **Rewards:** Mechanisms for claiming both general staking rewards and specific contribution-based rewards.

### II. Reputation & Contribution System
*   **Proposal Submission:** Enables users to submit IPFS hashes of curated datasets or proposed AI models.
*   **Community Voting:** Allows stakers to vote on the quality and validity of submitted proposals.
*   **Reputation System:** An on-chain score that reflects a participant's positive contributions and standing within the protocol.
*   **Slashing:** A mechanism to penalize malicious or low-quality contributions, affecting reputation and staked tokens.

### III. AI Evaluation & Oracle Management
*   **Oracle Integration:** Facilitates interaction with off-chain AI evaluation services via whitelisted oracles.
*   **Evaluation Submission:** Oracles submit results of AI model performance or data quality back to the contract.
*   **Oracle Registry:** Manages trusted addresses permitted to submit evaluation results.

### IV. Dynamic Fee & Treasury Management
*   **Protocol Fees:** Dynamic fee structure applied to certain operations, contributing to the protocol's sustainability.
*   **Treasury Distribution:** Mechanism to distribute collected fees to the staking rewards pool and a dedicated governance treasury.

### V. Governance & Protocol Upgrades
*   **Parameter Changes:** A decentralized governance system allowing community proposals and voting on core protocol parameters.
*   **Proposal Execution:** Automated execution of successfully voted-on governance proposals.
*   **Emergency Controls:** Pausability for critical functions in unforeseen circumstances.

## Function Summary

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract, deploys the AMP token, and sets the initial owner.
2.  `stake(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to stake their AMP tokens to participate and earn staking rewards.
3.  `unstake(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to unstake AMP tokens after a cool-down period.
4.  `claimStakingRewards()`: Enables users to claim accumulated general staking rewards.
5.  `getPendingStakingRewards(address _staker)`: View function to check a staker's current pending general rewards.
6.  `updateStakingRate(uint256 newRate)`: Governance function to adjust the annual percentage rate (APR) for general staking rewards.
7.  `submitDataOrModelProposal(string calldata _ipfsHash, bool _isDataSet)`: Allows users to submit an IPFS hash for a curated dataset or an AI model proposal.
8.  `voteOnProposalQuality(uint256 _proposalId, bool _votePositive)`: Enables stakers to vote on the quality of a submitted data or model proposal.
9.  `finalizeProposalEvaluation(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _aiEvaluationScore)`: Callable by registered oracles, finalizes a proposal's status based on community votes and an external AI evaluation score, updating the contributor's reputation.
10. `getReputationScore(address _user)`: View function to retrieve a user's current on-chain reputation score.
11. `claimContributionRewards()`: Allows users to claim rewards earned from successful proposals and accrued reputation.
12. `slashReputationAndStake(address _offender, uint256 _reputationLoss, uint256 _stakeLossPercentage)`: Governance or dispute resolution function to penalize malicious contributors by reducing reputation and staking.
13. `registerAIEvaluationOracle(address _oracleAddress)`: Adds an address to the whitelist of trusted AI evaluation oracles.
14. `deregisterAIEvaluationOracle(address _oracleAddress)`: Removes an address from the whitelist of trusted AI evaluation oracles.
15. `submitAIEvaluationResult(uint256 _proposalId, uint256 _score)`: Callable only by registered oracles to submit an AI model/data evaluation score for a specific proposal.
16. `setProtocolFeeRate(uint256 _newFeeRate)`: Governance function to adjust the percentage fee taken on certain protocol operations (e.g., unstaking fees).
17. `distributeProtocolTreasury()`: Distributes accumulated protocol fees from the contract balance to the staking rewards pool and a separate governance treasury address.
18. `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner (or a DAO multisig conceptually) to withdraw funds from the contract's treasury balance.
19. `proposeParameterChange(string calldata _description, bytes calldata _callData, address _targetContract)`: Initiates a governance proposal for protocol-wide parameter changes or upgrades, encoded as calldata for a target contract.
20. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _voteFor)`: Enables stakers to vote on active governance proposals.
21. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on governance proposal after its voting period and quorum are met.
22. `emergencyPause()`: Allows the owner to pause critical protocol functions in an emergency.
23. `unpauseProtocol()`: Allows the owner to unpause critical protocol functions.
24. `getProtocolFeeRate()`: View function to retrieve the current protocol fee rate.
25. `getTokenAddress()`: View function to retrieve the address of the AMP ERC20 token.

        // which then triggers a state change in the proposal that makes it ready for a *final* community vote.
        // This is still too complex.
        // Let's just make `finalizeProposalEvaluation` accept a trusted `_aiEvaluationScore` directly from an oracle.
