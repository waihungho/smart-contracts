Okay, let's design an interesting, advanced, and somewhat creative smart contract. We'll combine elements of decentralized identity/reputation, staking, and dynamic traits/permissions, avoiding direct copies of standard DeFi protocols or NFT structures.

Let's call the contract `NexusScoreV1` - representing a decentralized reputation and skill layer.

**Concept:** Users earn "Reputation Points" for contributions (abstracted), stake a native token (`NXS`) for commitment, and these two factors dynamically determine a "Skill Level". This Skill Level can then be used to gate access to certain functions or grant perks.

**Advanced Concepts Used:**
1.  **Dynamic State:** User "Skill Level" isn't a fixed value but calculated dynamically based on changing Reputation Points and staked tokens.
2.  **Time-Based Decay:** Reputation Points can decay over time if not maintained by new contributions, encouraging continued engagement.
3.  **Authorized Emitters:** Reputation Points are added by specific, authorized addresses, creating a layer of trust (can be extended with more complex oracles/ZK proofs in a real-world scenario).
4.  **Staking with Slashing/Lockup Potential (Placeholder):** Staking involves locking tokens, foundation for future slashing or complex reward mechanics (though V1 keeps it simple).
5.  **Permissioning based on Dynamic State:** Functions are gated not just by admin roles, but by a calculated user attribute (`SkillLevel`).
6.  **Upgradability Consideration (Implied):** Naming it V1 and using adjustable parameters hints at future versions or proxy patterns (though the contract itself isn't a proxy).
7.  **Parameterization:** Key contract behaviors (decay rate, skill calculation formula parameters) are configurable by the owner.

**Explanation of Design Choices & Features:**

1.  **Modularity:** The contract is structured into logical sections (State, Reputation, Staking, Skill, Admin).
2.  **OpenZeppelin Imports:** Uses standard, battle-tested libraries for common patterns like `Ownable` and `Pausable`. `SafeMath` is included for clarity, though 0.8+ has overflow checks built-in.
3.  **Dynamic Skill:** The `calculateSkillLevel` function is central. It's a `view` function, meaning the skill isn't stored statically but computed on the fly based on the user's current `reputationPoints` and `stakedNXS`.
4.  **Parameterized Skill:** The `SkillLevelConfig` struct and `updateSkillLevelConfig` function allow the owner to adjust the relative weighting of reputation vs. stake and set a `maxSkillLevel`, making the system adaptable without redeployment (within the confines of this V1).
5.  **Reputation Decay:** The `reputationDecayPeriod` and `reputationDecayRateBps` parameters introduce a time-sensitive element. `triggerReputationDecay` allows *anyone* to call the decay function, which checks if enough time has passed globally and then applies decay to all users whose profiles haven't been decayed since the *global* last trigger. *Self-Correction during thought:* Initially, I considered applying decay on every reputation update/stake, but that's complex. A global trigger is simpler but gas-intensive for many users. The implemented version calculates decay *per user* based on the *last time that user's points were decayed*, but the trigger check is global. This mixes concepts slightly; a pure global decay would update everyone's timestamp. A simpler, more gas-efficient approach for large user bases is user-triggered decay (user calls to decay *their own* points), or using a Merkle tree/ZK proof system off-chain. The current implementation is a hybrid: global trigger, user-specific calculation. Let's refine the decay to be simpler: triggered globally, applies based on *global* last decay time for everyone. This simplifies the user's `lastReputationDecayTimestamp` usage slightly. *Further Refinement:* The current code iterates through users *and* calculates decay since the user's *last* decay timestamp. This is actually quite sophisticated but still potentially gas-heavy for many users. Let's stick with this version as it's more complex than a simple global tick.
6.  **Authorized Issuers:** A simple access control pattern allowing specific addresses (beyond the owner) to perform a key function (`addReputationPoints`).
7.  **Staking:** Standard ERC20 staking using `transferFrom` (requires user approval) and `transfer`. `totalStakedNXS` tracks the aggregate.
8.  **Skill-Based Permissioning:** The `performSkilledAction` function demonstrates how the calculated skill level can be used to gate access, requiring `msg.sender` to have at least `minSkillRequired`. `setMinSkillForAction` makes this threshold adjustable.
9.  **User List (`userAddresses`):** This array is added to track users who have profiles. *Crucially*, iterating over this array (`getTotalUsersWithProfile`, `triggerReputationDecay`) becomes very gas-expensive as the number of users grows. This is a known scalability challenge in Solidity for patterns requiring full iteration. For a production system with many users, alternative patterns (like tracking count separately, using off-chain calculations/storage proofs, or requiring users to self-update/decay) would be necessary. This implementation includes it to meet the function count and demonstrate a profile tracking mechanism, but with a clear warning.
10. **Error Handling & Events:** Uses `require` for preconditions and emits events for significant state changes, crucial for monitoring and off-chain applications.
11. **Stray Token Recovery:** A standard safety function for owners to retrieve tokens sent to the contract by mistake, excluding the primary NXS token.
12. **Function Count:** The contract has 23 external/public/view functions and 1 internal function (`calculateSkillLevel`), comfortably exceeding the 20 function requirement.

This contract provides a foundation for a decentralized reputation system tied to token economics and time-based engagement, showcasing several intermediate to advanced Solidity concepts without being a direct clone of common protocols.
