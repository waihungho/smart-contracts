Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing an `OmniVault`. This contract aims to be an advanced multi-asset vault (handling ETH, ERC-20s, and ERC-721s) with a programmable, conditional action execution framework and unique ERC-1155 position tokens representing claims on specific deposits or resulting from vault activities.

This design avoids duplicating a standard ERC-4626 vault, a simple multi-sig, or a basic NFT staking contract by combining elements and adding complexity like conditional execution, multiple asset types in one vault, and position-specific tokens.

**Outline and Function Summary**

This contract, `OmniVault`, is a sophisticated vault capable of holding multiple asset types (ETH, ERC20, ERC721) and executing predefined, conditional actions. It uses ERC-1155 tokens to represent user positions/claims within the vault. Access to sensitive operations is managed via AccessControl roles.

1.  **Core Vault & Asset Management**
    *   `depositETH()`: Receives and records ETH deposits, minting a unique position token.
    *   `depositERC20()`: Receives and records ERC-20 deposits, minting a unique position token. Requires prior approval.
    *   `depositERC721()`: Receives and records ERC-721 NFT deposits, minting a unique position token. Requires `onERC721Received` callback.
    *   `withdrawETH()`: Allows withdrawal of ETH associated with specific position tokens. Burns position tokens.
    *   `withdrawERC20()`: Allows withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens associated with specific position tokens. Burns position tokens.
    *   `withdrawERC721()`: Allows withdrawal of ERC-721 NFTs associated with specific position tokens. Burns position tokens.
    *   `getERC20Balance()`: Get the vault's total balance of a specific ERC-20 token.
    *   `getETHBalance()`: Get the vault's total ETH balance.
    *   `getERC721Owner()`: Check if the vault owns a specific ERC-721 token ID.

2.  **Position Token (ERC-1155) Management**
    *   `balanceOf()`: (Inherited) Get user's balance of a specific position token ID.
    *   `balanceOfBatch()`: (Inherited) Get user's balances for multiple position token IDs.
    *   `setApprovalForAll()`: (Inherited) Approve/disapprove an operator for all token IDs.
    *   `isApprovedForAll()`: (Inherited) Check if an address is an approved operator.
    *   `safeTransferFrom()`: (Inherited) Transfer ownership of a specific position token ID.
    *   `safeBatchTransferFrom()`: (Inherited) Transfer ownership of multiple position token IDs.
    *   `uri()`: (Inherited) Get the URI for metadata of a position token ID.
    *   `getPositionDetails()`: Get detailed information about a specific position token ID (assets held, link to actions, etc.).

3.  **Action & Strategy Framework**
    *   `proposeAction()`: Allows users with the `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE` to propose a complex, potentially conditional action.
    *   `getActionDetails()`: Get details of a proposed or executed action.
    *   `addTimeConditionToAction()`: Add a time-based condition (e.g., timestamp) to a proposed action. Requires `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE`.
    *   `addOracleConditionToAction()`: Add an oracle-based condition (e.g., price feed) to a proposed action. Requires `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE`.
    *   `addBalanceConditionToAction()`: Add an internal vault balance condition to a proposed action. Requires `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE`.
    *   `approveAction()`: Allows users with the `ACTION_APPROVER_ROLE` to approve a proposed action.
    *   `checkActionConditions()`: Internal helper function to check if all conditions for an action are met.
    *   `executeAction()`: Allows users with the `ACTION_EXECUTOR_ROLE` (or delegated executors) to trigger an *approved* action *if* its conditions are met. Executes an external call.
    *   `cancelAction()`: Allows users with the `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE` or `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to cancel a proposed or approved action.

4.  **Access Control & Utility**
    *   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Role with full administrative privileges.
    *   `ACTION_PROPOSER_ROLE`: Role allowed to propose actions.
    *   `ACTION_APPROVER_ROLE`: Role allowed to approve actions.
    *   `ACTION_EXECUTOR_ROLE`: Role allowed to execute approved actions.
    *   `DELEGATE_EXECUTION_ROLE`: Role allowed to execute approved actions on behalf of authorized executors (e.g., keepers).
    *   `grantRole()`, `revokeRole()`, `renounceRole()`: (Inherited from AccessControl) Standard role management.
    *   `setOracleAddress()`: Set the address of a trusted oracle contract. Requires `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
    *   `setAllowedActionTarget()`: Restrict external contracts that `executeAction` can call for security. Requires `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
    *   `delegateExecution()`: Grant or revoke the `DELEGATE_EXECUTION_ROLE` to an address. Requires `ACTION_EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
    *   `emergencyWithdraw()`: Allows `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to pull *all* assets in an emergency (use with extreme caution).
