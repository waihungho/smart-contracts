Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a complex, advanced vault system I'll call `QuantumVault`. It combines several concepts like conditional unlocks, time decay, linked accounts ("entanglement"), state-dependent behavior ("superposition"), and interaction with an external token and oracle, aiming for uniqueness and complexity beyond standard examples.

**Concept Outline:**

The `QuantumVault` is a contract designed to hold ETH and a specific ERC20 token (`QuantumToken`) for users. Assets are locked initially and can only be withdrawn when a set of complex, interconnected conditions are met. These conditions involve time, an external oracle value, the state of a *linked* vault ("entanglement"), and a global contract state flag ("superposition"). The state of the contract and user vaults can change based on user interactions ("observer effect"), time decay, and admin actions.

**Key Concepts & Advanced Features:**

1.  **Conditional Unlocks:** Assets are locked behind multiple, potentially changing conditions.
2.  **State-Dependent Logic:** The contract's behavior and unlock criteria can depend on its own internal state (`isSuperpositionResolved`, `quantumEnergy`) and external data (oracle).
3.  **Entangled Vaults:** Users can link their vaults, making the unlock condition of one dependent on the state of the other.
4.  **Superposition Simulation:** A global state flag (`isSuperpositionResolved`) that represents a system-wide condition required for certain unlocks. This state can be changed based on administrator actions or potentially complex triggers.
5.  **Quantum Decay (Simulated):** A parameter (`quantumEnergy`) that decays over time, potentially making oracle-based conditions harder or affecting potential rewards/penalties. Can be influenced by user interaction or admin.
6.  **Observer Effect (Simulated):** The first user to trigger the *checking* of conditions might cause a state change (like resolving superposition) if the conditions are met at that moment for the *system*.
7.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated permissions for owner/admin.
8.  **ERC20 & ETH Handling:** Manages both native currency and a custom token.
9.  **Oracle Integration (Conceptual):** Includes a placeholder for interacting with an external data feed.
10. **Complex State Management:** Tracks multiple variables per user vault and globally.
11. **Event-Driven State Changes:** Emits events for significant state transitions.

**Function Summary (Approx. 38 functions):**

*   **Vault Interaction (4 functions):**
    *   `depositEth()`: Deposit ETH into the sender's vault.
    *   `depositTokens(uint256 amount)`: Deposit QuantumTokens into the sender's vault.
    *   `withdrawEth()`: Attempt to withdraw unlocked ETH.
    *   `withdrawTokens()`: Attempt to withdraw unlocked QuantumTokens.
*   **Condition Checking (External View - 8 functions):**
    *   `checkUnlockConditions(address user)`: Check if *all* unlock conditions are met for a user.
    *   `isUserTimeUnlocked(address user)`: Check if the time-based condition is met.
    *   `isUserOracleConditionMet(address user)`: Check if the oracle-based condition is met.
    *   `isUserEntangledVaultUnlocked(address user)`: Check if the linked vault's condition is met.
    *   `isUserSuperpositionResolved(address user)`: Check if the global superposition condition is met (required for withdrawal).
    *   `canWithdrawEth(address user)`: Check if ETH is currently withdrawable for a user (checks all conditions).
    *   `canWithdrawTokens(address user)`: Check if Tokens are currently withdrawable for a user (checks all conditions).
    *   `getRequiredOracleValue()`: Get the current target value for the oracle condition.
*   **Quantum Mechanics / State Transitions (6 functions):**
    *   `attemptQuantumUnlock()`: User-callable function to trigger condition checks and potentially resolve superposition if conditions are met *globally* or for their vault.
    *   `resolveSuperposition()`: Admin function to manually set the global superposition state (e.g., after a system event).
    *   `entangleVaults(address user1, address user2)`: Admin function to link two user vaults.
    *   `decayQuantumEnergy()`: Public function (maybe with a fee) to trigger the decay of the global `quantumEnergy`.
    *   `setSuperpositionResolutionConditionValue(uint256 value)`: Admin function to set the value required to resolve superposition via `attemptQuantumUnlock`.
    *   `triggerQuantumFluctuation(uint256 interactionCount)`: Admin function to simulate fluctuation, maybe adding a bonus to `quantumEnergy` based on recent activity (interactionCount).

    *   `setOracleAddress(address newOracle)`: Set the address of the oracle contract.
    *   `setQuantumTokenAddress(address newToken)`: Set the address of the QuantumToken contract.

    *   `getQuantumEnergy()`: Get the current global `quantumEnergy` value.
    *   `getEntangledVault(address user)`: Get the address of the vault entangled with the user's vault.
    *   `getBaseUnlockTime()`: Get the minimum lock duration setting.

*   **Internal Helper Functions (Approx. 5 functions):** Used internally for state updates, condition checks, oracle interaction, etc. (These don't count towards the 20+ external functions but are essential for logic).
