 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Not for Production)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art collective, enabling artists to submit artwork,
 *      members to curate and vote on artwork, fractionalize ownership, and participate in
 *      governance and revenue sharing.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Collective Management:**
 *    - `constructor(string _collectiveName, uint256 _membershipFee, uint256 _artworkSubmissionFee, uint256 _curationVoteCost)`: Initializes the collective with name, fees.
 *    - `getCollectiveName()`: Returns the name of the art collective.
 *    - `getMembershipFee()`: Returns the membership fee.
 *    - `setMembershipFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Allows the owner to update the membership fee.
 *    - `getArtworkSubmissionFee()`: Returns the artwork submission fee.
 *    - `setArtworkSubmissionFee(uint256 _newFee)`: Allows the owner to update the artwork submission fee.
 *    - `getCollectiveBalance()`: Returns the contract's ETH balance.
 *    - `withdrawCollectiveFunds(address payable _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw collective funds.
 *    - `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.
 *
 * **2. Membership Management:**
 *    - `joinCollective()`: Allows users to become members by paying the membership fee.
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective (potentially with conditions).
 *    - `isMember(address _user)`: Checks if an address is a member.
 *    - `getMemberCount()`: Returns the total number of members.
 *
 * **3. Artwork Submission & Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string memory _artworkTitle, string memory _artworkCID, string memory _artworkDescription)`: Allows members to submit artwork with title, CID, and description, paying a submission fee.
 *    - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve)`: Allows members to vote to approve or reject submitted artwork, costing a curation vote fee.
 *    - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current curation status (pending, approved, rejected) of an artwork.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns details of a specific artwork.
 *    - `getApprovedArtworkCount()`: Returns the number of approved artworks.
 *
 * **4. Fractionalized Ownership & Revenue Sharing (Advanced Concept):**
 *    - `fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfShares)`:  Allows the collective to fractionalize approved artwork into shares (ERC1155-like).
 *    - `purchaseArtworkShares(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _numberOfShares)`: Allows members to purchase shares of fractionalized artwork.
 *    - `getArtworkSharePrice(uint256 _artworkId)`: Returns the current share price for an artwork (could be dynamically priced).
 *    - `distributeArtworkRevenue(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _revenueAmount)`: Allows the collective to distribute revenue generated by an artwork to share holders and the artist.
 *    - `withdrawArtworkShareRevenue(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows share holders to withdraw their earned revenue from a specific artwork.
 *
 * **5. Governance (Basic Example):**
 *    - `proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _proposalDescription, bytes memory _calldata)`: Allows members to propose changes to the contract (e.g., fee changes, voting rules, etc.).
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `getGovernanceProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the status of a governance proposal (pending, passed, rejected).
 *    - `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the owner (or a DAO-like execution mechanism) to execute passed governance proposals.
 *    - `getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns details of a governance proposal.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Functions:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Theme:**  The contract embodies the idea of a community-driven art platform, going beyond simple NFT marketplaces by incorporating governance and collective decision-making.

2.  **Membership-Based Access:**  Restricting core functionalities (artwork submission, curation, governance) to members creates a sense of exclusivity and community ownership. The membership fee acts as a barrier to entry and can contribute to the collective's treasury.

3.  **Artwork Curation via Voting:**  The voting mechanism for artwork approval is a core DAO principle. Members collectively decide which artworks are accepted into the collective, ensuring a level of quality control and community alignment.

4.  **Fractionalized Artwork Ownership (ERC1155-like):** This is a more advanced concept. By fractionalizing approved artworks into shares, the contract enables:
    *   **Shared Ownership:** Multiple members can own a piece of art, making high-value art more accessible.
    *   **Revenue Sharing:**  When fractionalized artwork generates revenue (e.g., through future sales, exhibitions, etc. - *external to this contract for now, but could be integrated further*), it can be distributed proportionally to share holders.
    *   **Increased Liquidity:** Shares can potentially be traded or transferred (though not implemented in this basic example, it's a natural extension).

5.  **Governance Mechanism (Basic):**  The inclusion of governance proposals and voting allows the collective to evolve and adapt over time. Members can propose and vote on changes to fees, rules, or even contract upgrades (more complex implementation needed for full upgradeability).

6.  **Revenue Distribution Logic:**  The `distributeArtworkRevenue` and `withdrawArtworkShareRevenue` functions demonstrate a basic revenue-sharing model.  This can be expanded upon to include more complex distribution strategies, artist royalties, collective fund allocations, etc.

7.  **Fees for Sustainability:** The membership fee and artwork submission fee are designed to create a sustainable model for the collective, funding operations, development, and potentially artist rewards.

8.  **Version Control:**  The `version` variable and `getVersion()` function are basic but good practices for contract management and potential upgrades in the future.

**Important Notes and Potential Improvements:**

*   **Gas Optimization:**  The code is written for clarity and demonstration of concepts.  For a production-ready contract, gas optimization would be crucial, especially in loops and storage operations (e.g., member iteration for revenue distribution is inefficient).
*   **Security Audits:**  This is example code and has not been professionally audited. Security audits are essential before deploying any smart contract to a live environment.
*   **Error Handling and Revert Reasons:**  More specific and informative error messages could be added for better user experience.
*   **More Sophisticated Governance:**  The governance mechanism is basic.  Real-world DAOs often use more complex voting strategies (quadratic voting, weighted voting), quorum requirements, timelocks, and off-chain voting systems.
*   **Dynamic Share Pricing:**  The share price for fractionalized artwork is currently fixed.  It could be made dynamic based on demand, market value, or algorithmic pricing mechanisms.
*   **NFT Integration:**  While the contract manages artwork metadata (CID), it doesn't directly mint NFTs. Integrating with an NFT standard (like ERC721 or ERC1155 for shares) would be a natural next step to represent the artwork and shares as on-chain assets.
*   **Off-Chain Storage and IPFS:**  The artwork CID points to off-chain storage (like IPFS).  This is common for NFTs, but considerations around data persistence and censorship resistance are important.
*   **Scalability:**  The current implementation might not scale efficiently to a very large number of members or artworks, especially functions that iterate through members. Techniques like indexed data structures or off-chain processing might be needed for scalability.
*   **External Revenue Generation:** The example contract focuses on internal revenue flows (fees, share purchases). To make it truly sustainable, integration with external revenue streams (e.g., sales on NFT marketplaces, licensing, physical exhibitions, etc.) would be necessary.

This contract provides a foundation for a creative and advanced decentralized art collective.  It incorporates several trendy concepts and demonstrates how smart contracts can be used for more than just simple token transfers, enabling community-driven platforms with complex functionalities. Remember to consider the improvement points and best practices for security and scalability if you plan to develop this further.
