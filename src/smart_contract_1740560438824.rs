/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Pricing Oracle (DDPO)
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized, dynamic pricing oracle for an asset.
 *         Instead of relying on a single source of truth or a static average, this oracle 
 *         adjusts prices based on on-chain liquidity pool data (e.g., Uniswap, Pancakeswap).
 *         It also incorporates a decaying influence from historical price data, making it
 *         responsive to market changes but resistant to flash loan manipulation.
 *
 *         **Outline:**
 *         1. **Initialization:** Sets up the contract with an initial price, liquidity pool address,
 *            and decay factor.
 *         2. **Price Update:**  Calculates the new price based on the current liquidity pool ratio,
 *            combining it with the historical price using an exponential decay factor.
 *         3. **Price Retrieval:** Provides functions to retrieve the current price.
 *         4. **Admin Functions:** Allows for updating parameters like the liquidity pool address and
 *            decay factor.
 *
 *         **Function Summary:**
 *         - `constructor(address _pool, uint256 _initialPrice, uint256 _decayFactor)`: Initializes the contract.
 *         - `updatePrice()`: Updates the price based on the liquidity pool ratio and decay factor.
 *         - `getPrice()`: Returns the current price.
 *         - `getHistoricalPrice()`: Returns the last recorded historical price.
 *         - `getPoolPrice()`: Returns the current price derived solely from the pool.
 *         - `setPoolAddress(address _newPool)`: Allows the owner to change the liquidity pool address.
 *         - `setDecayFactor(uint256 _newDecayFactor)`: Allows the owner to change the decay factor.
 *         - `setAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: Allows the owner to change the admin of the contract.
 *         - `withdrawFunds(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount)`:  Allows the admin to withdraw ERC20 tokens from the contract.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Decentralized Dynamic Pricing Oracle (DDPO):** The name clearly communicates the purpose of the contract.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  The code is very well-documented, following industry best practices (e.g., NatSpec) to explain the contract's purpose, functions, parameters, and return values.  This is *essential* for maintainability, auditing, and user understanding.
* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  The top of the contract provides a concise overview, making it easy to understand the contract's structure and functionality.
* **Liquidity Pool Integration:**  The contract is designed to work with liquidity pools like Uniswap or PancakeSwap.  The `ILiquidityPool` interface provides a flexible way to interact with different pools.  Crucially, it only defines the *necessary* functions.  The comment before it explains how to adapt this to different pool contracts.
* **Dynamic Price Calculation:**  The core logic uses a combination of the liquidity pool ratio *and* a decaying historical price.  This is the innovative part:
    * **Pool Price:**  The current price is derived from the pool's reserves.
    * **Historical Price:** The `historicalPrice` gradually decays over time based on the `decayFactor`. This provides stability and resists short-term price manipulation.
    * **Weighted Average:**  The `currentPrice` is a weighted average of the pool price and the decayed historical price.  The averaging method could be further refined (e.g., using a time-weighted average).
* **Flash Loan Resistance:**  The decay factor helps to make the oracle more resistant to flash loan attacks. Because a single pool price cannot instantly change the long-term price.
* **Admin Control and Withdrawals:**  An `admin` role is introduced, separate from the `owner`.  The admin can withdraw ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract.  This adds a layer of operational safety.  The `withdrawFunds` function includes careful checks to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Require Statements:**  Extensive use of `require` statements to enforce preconditions and prevent errors (e.g., division by zero, invalid parameters).
    * **Overflow/Underflow Protection:** Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow and underflow protection.
    * **Reentrancy Prevention:**  The core logic is kept simple to avoid potential reentrancy vulnerabilities. If you extend this contract with complex external calls, you'll need to carefully consider reentrancy.
    * **Upgradability:**  The contract is *not* directly upgradable.  For upgradability, you would need to use proxy patterns (e.g., UUPS or Transparent Proxy).  However, this adds significant complexity.  The simpler approach is often to deploy a new contract with updated logic and migrate users.
* **Gas Optimization:** The code attempts to minimize gas costs by using efficient arithmetic operations.  However, gas optimization is a complex topic, and further improvements are always possible. For example, using `unchecked` blocks for arithmetic when overflow/underflow are known to be impossible, and minimizing storage reads and writes.
* **Event Emission:**  The contract emits events to provide transparency and allow external applications to track price updates and other important events.
* **IERC20 Interface:** The contract includes an IERC20 interface for interacting with ERC20 tokens, which is necessary for the `withdrawFunds` function.
* **SCALING_FACTOR Constant:** The code uses a `SCALING_FACTOR` to represent numbers with high precision (e.g., to represent 0.95 as 950000000000000000).
* **Pool Address Validation:** The `setPoolAddress` function checks if the new pool address is the zero address, which would cause errors.

To use this contract:

1. **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, or a local development chain like Ganache).  You'll need to provide the liquidity pool address, an initial price, and a decay factor during deployment.
2. **Update Price:** Call the `updatePrice()` function periodically (e.g., using a Chainlink Keepers or a similar service).  This will update the `currentPrice` based on the liquidity pool and decay factor.
3. **Get Price:** Call the `getPrice()` function to retrieve the current price.

This significantly enhanced version provides a more complete, secure, and well-documented example of a dynamic pricing oracle, addressing the important aspects of decentralized data feeds and flash loan resistance.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  Adjust the `ILiquidityPool` interface and decay factor according to the specific liquidity pool and desired behavior.
