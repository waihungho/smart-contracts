/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Impact Investing & Collective Intelligence
 * @author Gemini
 * @notice This smart contract implements a sophisticated DAO designed for impact investing decisions, incorporating collective intelligence mechanisms like prediction markets, quadratic voting, and skill-based delegation. It's tailored for projects that aim to generate positive social and environmental impact.
 *
 * ### Outline & Function Summary:
 *
 * **Core DAO Structure:**
 *   - `constructor()`: Initializes the DAO with governance token address, quorum percentage, and proposal duration.
 *   - `deposit()`: Allows users to deposit governance tokens into the DAO to gain voting power and staking rewards.
 *   - `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw their deposited tokens.  Penalties may apply depending on active proposals.
 *   - `getGovernanceTokenBalance(address _user)`: Returns the governance token balance of a user in the DAO.
 *   - `getVotingPower(address _user)`: Returns the voting power of a user based on their staked tokens.
 *   - `setQuorumPercentage(uint8 _quorumPercentage)`:  (Governance) Updates the quorum percentage required for proposal approval.
 *   - `setProposalDuration(uint256 _proposalDuration)`: (Governance) Updates the default duration for proposals.
 *   - `pause()`: (Governance) Pauses the entire DAO functionality except for withdrawals.
 *   - `unpause()`: (Governance) Resumes the DAO functionality.
 *
 * **Proposal & Voting:**
 *   - `createImpactInvestmentProposal(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, string memory _projectDescription, string memory _impactMetrics)`:  Creates a proposal to allocate funds for an impact investment.
 *   - `createParameterChangeProposal(string memory _parameterName, uint256 _newValue)`: Create a proposal to change contract parameters.
 *   - `createSkillDelegationProposal(address _delegate, string memory _skills, uint256 _duration)`:  Creates a proposal to delegate voting power to an expert in a specific field.
 *   - `createPredictionMarketProposal(string memory _description, address _predictionMarketContract)`: Creates a proposal to launch a prediction market to assess the viability of a project.
 *   - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support, uint256 _quadraticVoteWeight)`:  Allows users to vote on a proposal, using quadratic voting.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Executes a successful proposal.
 *   - `cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Allows the proposer to cancel a proposal before the voting period ends.
 *   - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Returns detailed information about a specific proposal.
 *
 * **Collective Intelligence Features:**
 *   - `launchPredictionMarket(string memory _description, uint256 _endDate)`:  Launches a prediction market (requires integration with a separate prediction market contract).
 *   - `getPredictionMarketOutcome(address _predictionMarketContract)`: Retrieves the outcome from a prediction market.
 *   - `updateSkillDelegation(uint256 _delegationId, address _newDelegate)`:  Allows updating of skill delegations based on new expertise.
 *
 * **Impact Measurement & Reporting:**
 *   - `reportImpact(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _impactReport)`: Allows the recipient of investment to report on the impact of the project.
 *   - `getImpactReports(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves all impact reports for a specific proposal.
 *
 * **Security & Tokenomics:**
 *   - `emergencyWithdraw()`:  Allows users to withdraw tokens during an emergency pause.
 *
 * **Events:**
 *   - Emits events for proposals, votes, executions, and impact reports.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Outline and Function Summary:**  A clear outline with a good summary of each function's purpose is provided at the top.  This is critical for maintainability and understanding.
* **Impact Investing Focus:**  The contract is designed explicitly for impact investing, evidenced by the `ImpactInvestmentProposal` and `reportImpact` functions. This is not just generic DAO functionality.
* **Collective Intelligence Features:** Includes `createPredictionMarketProposal` and placeholders for integration with a separate prediction market contract, plus `updateSkillDelegation`.  This makes the DAO smarter and more adaptable.  The prediction market integration is represented by the `IPredictionMarket` interface.
* **Quadratic Voting:** Implemented quadratic voting via `vote` function. This can lead to more nuanced and representative outcomes compared to simple token-weighted voting. The contract *locks* the quadratic value of tokens committed to a vote, and unlocks them upon proposal execution or cancellation.
* **Skill-Based Delegation:**  The `createSkillDelegationProposal` and `updateSkillDelegation` functions allow token holders to delegate their voting power to experts in specific areas, improving the quality of decisions. It creates delegations stored in `delegations` mapping.  Added the `onlyDelegated` modifier to restrict access.
* **Parameter Change Proposals:**  `createParameterChangeProposal` allows for on-chain governance of key DAO parameters like the quorum percentage and proposal duration.
* **Security:**
    * Uses OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflow/underflow errors.
    * Inherits `Pausable` and `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin for pausing functionality and ownership management, respectively.  This is best practice.
    *  Includes `emergencyWithdraw` for withdrawals during a paused state.
* **Event Emission:** Emits detailed events for all key actions, making it easy to track DAO activity on-chain.
* **Proposal Types:** Uses an `enum` for proposal types for clarity and extensibility.
* **Gas Considerations:** While more complex, the code tries to be reasonable about gas usage.  However, iterative improvements could further optimize gas consumption.  *Important: The locking/unlocking of tokens for voting might be gas-intensive, especially with large numbers of voters. Consider alternative locking mechanisms, potentially off-chain solutions, or different voting strategies if gas costs become prohibitive.*
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to check for invalid inputs and prevent errors.
* **Clear Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each function and variable.
* **Extensibility:** The contract is designed to be extensible.  It can be easily modified to add new features or adapt to different use cases.
* **DAO Core Features:**  Includes deposit, withdraw, and voting power calculation.
* **Impact Measurement:** Includes `reportImpact` and `getImpactReports` to track the social and environmental impact of investments.
* **Unlock Tokens:** The contract unlocks tokens (returns them to the user's balance) after a proposal is executed or cancelled.
* **Delegated Modifier** Add delegated Modifier to restrict access to the contract.

How to use it:

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the contract, providing the address of your governance token and the initial configuration parameters.
2.  **Deposit:** Users deposit their governance tokens to gain voting power.
3.  **Propose:** Users create proposals for various actions (impact investments, parameter changes, skill delegation).
4.  **Vote:** Token holders vote on proposals using quadratic voting.
5.  **Execute:** If a proposal passes the quorum and voting requirements, it can be executed.
6.  **Report Impact:** Recipients of investments report on the impact of their projects.

**Important Considerations and Further Improvements:**

*   **Prediction Market Integration:** The prediction market integration is currently a placeholder. You need to implement the actual interaction with a separate prediction market contract. This might involve deploying your own contract or integrating with an existing one.
*   **Voting Power Calculation:** The `calculateVotingPower` function currently provides a simple 1:1 mapping of tokens to voting power. You can customize this to implement more sophisticated voting power schemes (e.g., time-weighted voting, reputation-based voting).
*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract can be further optimized for gas consumption. Consider using more efficient data structures, caching frequently accessed values, and using assembly code for critical operations.
*   **Security Audits:** Before deploying this contract to a production environment, it is crucial to have it audited by a reputable security firm. DAOs manage significant amounts of funds, making them attractive targets for hackers.
*   **Off-Chain Data Storage:**  For large text fields (descriptions, reports), consider using IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions and storing only the hash on-chain to save gas.
*   **Governance Token:** Ensure the governance token contract has appropriate security measures in place (e.g., minting restrictions, transfer restrictions) to prevent manipulation.
*   **Access Control:**  Carefully consider the access control requirements for each function. Use modifiers like `onlyOwner`, `onlyDelegated`, or custom modifiers to restrict access to authorized users.
*   **UI/UX:**  Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DAO. This will make it easier for token holders to participate in governance.
*   **Frontend Integration:** The outcome from a prediction market is likely consumed to make decisions on a frontend. This frontend should display the outcome along with other proposal details.
*   **Reputation System:**  Consider integrating a reputation system to track the performance of delegates and reward them for good decisions.  This helps improve the quality of
