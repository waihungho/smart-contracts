/**
 * @title Decentralized Content Royalty & DAO-Governed Promotion Platform
 * @author Bard (Generated)
 * @notice This smart contract allows creators to mint content (e.g., music, articles, images) as NFTs,
 *         set royalty percentages, and participate in a DAO that manages a fund for promoting content.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - `mintContent(string memory _metadataURI, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`:  Mints a new content NFT and sets its royalty percentage.
 *  - `setContentMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _newMetadataURI)`:  Updates the metadata URI of an existing content NFT (can only be called by the content owner).
 *  - `transferOwnership(uint256 _tokenId, address _newOwner)`: Transfers ownership of a content NFT.
 *  - `royaltyInfo(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _salePrice) public view returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount)`:  Returns the royalty receiver and amount for a given sale price.
 *  - `donateToPromotionFund() payable`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the DAO's promotion fund.
 *  - `requestPromotion(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _promotionDescription)`:  Creators can request promotion of their content, requiring DAO voting.
 *  - `voteOnPromotion(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: DAO members can vote for or against a promotion proposal.
 *  - `executePromotion(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successful promotion proposal, transferring ETH to the content creator.
 *  - `getPromotionProposal(uint256 _proposalId) public view returns (Proposal memory)`: Get details on a specific promotion proposal.
 *  - `withdrawPromotionFund(address _to, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the DAO admin to withdraw funds from the promotion fund (governance needed, not implemented here for simplicity - use a proper DAO library).
 *  - `setDAOParameters(uint256 _quorumPercentage, uint256 _votingPeriod)`: Set the parameters for the DAO voting. Only callable by the DAO admin.

Key improvements and explanations of the code:

* **Clear Structure and Comments:** The code is well-structured with detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function, variable, and event.  This makes the contract much easier to understand and maintain.  The function summary at the top provides a quick overview.
* **Content Royalty:**  Implements a basic royalty mechanism on secondary sales.  The `royaltyInfo` function returns the royalty receiver and amount.
* **DAO-Governed Promotion:** This is the core innovative feature.  It allows content creators to request promotion for their NFTs through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).
    * **Promotion Fund:**  A fund is created to finance the promotions.  Anyone can donate to the fund.
    * **Promotion Proposals:** Content creators can submit promotion proposals.
    * **DAO Voting:** DAO members vote on the proposals.  A simple voting mechanism is implemented.
    * **Promotion Execution:** If a proposal passes the vote, the contract executes the promotion by transferring ETH from the promotion fund to the content creator.
* **DAO Membership:** A simple mechanism for managing DAO members (using a `mapping`).  **Crucially, a real DAO would use a much more sophisticated membership management system (e.g., a separate token or governance contract).  This example uses `isDAOMember` for simplicity only.**
* **Gas Optimization:**  Uses `storage` keyword properly when modifying structs in functions to reduce gas costs.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Reentrancy Protection:** While not explicitly using `ReentrancyGuard`, the `executePromotion` function is careful in transferring ETH using `call{value: ...}("")` and checks the return value to prevent reentrancy attacks. This is not foolproof.  In a production contract, `ReentrancyGuard` is *highly recommended*.
    * **Overflow/Underflow Protection:** Solidity 0.8.0 and later have built-in overflow/underflow protection, so SafeMath is no longer needed.
    * **Access Control:** Uses `onlyOwner` and custom modifiers (`onlyDAOMember`, `onlyContentOwner`) to restrict access to sensitive functions.
    * **Royalty Limits:** A `maxRoyaltyPercentage` is introduced to limit the maximum royalty percentage that can be set, preventing creators from setting excessively high royalties.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) protection:** The check `creator.call{value: proposal.promotionCost}("")` returns `success`, helping to prevent DoS attacks if the token transfer fails.
* **Events:** Emits events to allow external applications to track important contract activities (minting, transfers, promotion requests, votes, etc.).
* **OpenZeppelin Imports:** Uses OpenZeppelin contracts for ERC721 functionality and access control, leveraging well-tested and audited code.
* **Clear Errors:** Uses descriptive error messages to help debug issues.
* **Proposal Deadlines:** Proposals have deadlines to prevent stale votes.

**Important Considerations for Production:**

1. **DAO Implementation:** The DAO implementation in this contract is *extremely basic*.  For a real DAO, you would need a much more robust system for managing members, proposals, voting, and execution. Consider using existing DAO frameworks like:
   * **Governor (OpenZeppelin):** Offers a flexible framework for on-chain governance.
   * **Compound Governance:** A well-established governance standard.
   * **Snapshot:** Off-chain voting with on-chain execution.

2. **Security Audit:** Before deploying this contract to a production environment, it's *essential* to have it audited by a reputable security firm.

3. **Upgradeability:** If you need to upgrade the contract in the future, consider using an upgradeable contract pattern (e.g., proxy pattern).

4. **Gas Costs:**  Optimize the contract for gas efficiency.  Consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms.

5. **Off-Chain Metadata Storage:** Storing metadata on-chain can be expensive. Consider using off-chain storage solutions like IPFS.

6. **Front-End Integration:**  A user-friendly front-end is crucial for users to interact with the contract.

7. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the contract.

8. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the contract with unit tests and integration tests.

9. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for the contract.

This improved version provides a good foundation for building a decentralized content royalty and promotion platform with DAO governance.  Remember to address the security and implementation considerations mentioned above before deploying it to production.
