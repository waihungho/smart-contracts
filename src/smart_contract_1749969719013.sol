Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Creating a unique smart contract with advanced, creative, and trendy features while avoiding direct duplication of open-source projects requires combining multiple concepts in a novel way.

Let's design a contract called "QuantumFlux Token" (QFT). This token will have dynamic properties inspired by quantum mechanics concepts (simulated on-chain, of course, as real quantum computing isn't yet integrated). Its behavior will change based on a "Flux State" that evolves probabilistically, influenced by token activity and external triggers. It will also feature address-specific "Flux Affinity" and special probabilistic transfer mechanisms.

Here's the outline and function summary, followed by the Solidity code.

**Function Summary (Total: 31 functions):**

1.  `constructor(string name_, string symbol_, uint8 decimals_, uint256 initialSupply, address feeCollector)`: Initializes the token, sets up basic ERC-20 properties, mints initial supply, sets owner and fee collector.
2.  `totalSupply() view returns (uint256)`: Returns the total supply of tokens.
3.  `balanceOf(address account) view returns (uint256)`: Returns the balance of a specific account.
4.  `transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) returns (bool)`: Transfers tokens, applying fees and potentially triggering flux state evolution.
5.  `approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool)`: Allows a spender to withdraw tokens from the caller's account.
6.  `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) returns (bool)`: Transfers tokens from one account to another using the allowance mechanism, applying fees and triggering flux evolution.
7.  `allowance(address owner, address spender) view returns (uint256)`: Returns the allowance amount.
8.  `name() view returns (string)`: Returns the token name.
9.  `symbol() view returns (string)`: Returns the token symbol.
10. `decimals() view returns (uint8)`: Returns the number of decimal places.

12. `getFluxStateName(FluxState state) pure returns (string)`: Returns the string name for a given FluxState enum value.
13. `triggerProbabilisticFluxEvolution() payable`: Anyone can call this function to try and trigger a probabilistic change in the Flux State. Requires a small fee to prevent spam.
14. `setFluxEvolutionProbabilities(FluxState fromState, uint256 stableProb, uint256 fluctuatingProb, uint256 chaoticProb)`: Owner-only function to set the probabilities of transitioning to each state from a given `fromState`. Probabilities are in basis points (0-10000).
15. `getFluxEvolutionProbabilities(FluxState fromState) view returns (uint256 stableProb, uint256 fluctuatingProb, uint256 chaoticProb)`: Returns the configured evolution probabilities for a given state.
