/**
 * @title CreativeDAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Creative Projects
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) focused on fostering and funding creative projects.
 * It incorporates advanced concepts like skill-based roles, reputation system, dynamic voting mechanisms,
 * NFT-based project ownership, and decentralized dispute resolution.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * DAO Governance and Membership:
 * 1. joinDAO(): Allows users to join the DAO by staking tokens and receiving membership.
 * 2. leaveDAO(): Allows members to leave the DAO and unstake their tokens.
 * 3. proposeGovernanceChange(string _proposalDetails): Allows members to propose changes to DAO governance parameters.
 * 4. voteOnGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId, bool _support): Allows members to vote on governance change proposals.
 * 5. executeGovernanceChange(uint _proposalId): Executes an approved governance change proposal.
 * 6. assignSkill(address _member, string _skill): Allows admins to assign skills to members for role-based project contribution.
 * 7. revokeSkill(address _member, string _skill): Allows admins to revoke skills from members.
 * 8. updateMembershipTier(address _member, uint _newTier): Allows admins to update membership tiers based on contribution or token stake.
 * 9. getMemberDetails(address _member): Returns details of a DAO member, including skills, reputation, and tier.
 *
 * Project Proposal and Funding:
 * 10. proposeProject(string _projectName, string _projectDescription, uint _fundingGoal, string[] memory _requiredSkills): Allows members to propose creative projects for DAO funding.
 * 11. voteOnProjectProposal(uint _projectId, bool _support): Allows members to vote on project proposals.
 * 12. fundProject(uint _projectId): Funds an approved project from the DAO treasury if enough votes and funds are available.
 * 13. submitProjectMilestone(uint _projectId, string _milestoneDescription): Allows project owners to submit milestones for progress tracking and funding release.
 * 14. approveProjectMilestone(uint _projectId, uint _milestoneId): Allows DAO to vote on approving project milestones, releasing funds upon approval.
 * 15. cancelProjectProposal(uint _projectId): Allows project proposers to cancel their project proposal before funding.
 * 16. reportProjectCompletion(uint _projectId): Allows project owners to report project completion for final review and rewards.
 *
 * Reputation and Rewards:
 * 17. rewardContribution(address _member, uint _reputationPoints, string _reason): Allows admins or designated roles to reward members for contributions, increasing reputation.
 * 18. penalizeMisconduct(address _member, uint _reputationPoints, string _reason): Allows admins or designated roles to penalize members for misconduct, decreasing reputation.
 * 19. viewMemberReputation(address _member): Allows anyone to view a member's reputation score.
 * 20. distributeProjectRewards(uint _projectId): Distributes rewards to project contributors based on their roles and reputation after successful project completion.
 *
 * Utility and Treasury:
 * 21. depositFunds(): Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
 * 22. withdrawFunds(uint _amount): Allows DAO admins to withdraw funds from the treasury (governance controlled).
 * 23. getTreasuryBalance(): Returns the current balance of the DAO treasury.
 * 24. emergencyPauseDAO(string _reason): Allows admins to pause critical DAO functions in case of emergency.
 * 25. emergencyResumeDAO(): Allows admins to resume paused DAO functions after emergency resolution.
 *
 * NFT Project Ownership (Conceptual - requires further ERC721/ERC1155 integration for full implementation):
 * 26. claimProjectNFT(uint _projectId): (Conceptual) Allows project owners to claim an NFT representing ownership of their funded project.
 * 27. transferProjectNFT(uint _projectId, address _newOwner): (Conceptual) Allows transfer of project ownership NFT.
 *
