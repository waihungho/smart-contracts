Okay, let's design a smart contract based on a concept inspired by quantum mechanics - specifically, superposition and measurement - applied to access control and state management. We'll call it `QuantumLock`.

The idea is that certain critical parameters or the ability to execute actions within the contract depend on a value that exists in a "superposition" (multiple potential states simultaneously) until a "measurement" is performed. The measurement collapses the superposition into a single, definitive state based on some on-chain input (like a hash derived from block data, sender, and a user-provided seed). This measured value then determines access or contract behavior. We can also add "quantum gate" inspired functions to manipulate the superposition before measurement.

**Disclaimer:** This contract *simulates* quantum concepts using classical computing principles on the EVM. It does *not* use actual quantum computing or provide cryptographic quantum resistance. The "randomness" of the measurement outcome relies on the pseudo-randomness achievable on-chain (miner influence on block hash/timestamp is a factor).

## Smart Contract: QuantumLock

**Concept:** Simulates quantum superposition and measurement to control access and state updates. A critical value exists in a weighted superposition of two possible states until a `measureQubit` function is called, collapsing it to one state based on on-chain entropy and a seed. Access to protected functions/data depends on the resulting measured value.

**Key Features:**
1.  **Qubit Simulation:** Manages a state represented as a weighted superposition of two discrete values (state 0 and state 1).
2.  **Quantum Gates (Simulated):** Functions to manipulate the superposition weights (e.g., Hadamard-like, Pauli-X-like).
3.  **Measurement:** A function to collapse the superposition into a single deterministic value based on a seed and block data.
4.  **Conditional Access:** Functions and data access are gated based on the value resulting from the measurement.
5.  **Measurement Management:** Control over who can measure and the ability to reset the measurement state under certain conditions.
6.  **Seed Commitment:** Allows users to commit to a measurement seed beforehand.
7.  **Conceptual Entanglement:** A function to signal a potential interaction with another system upon measurement (conceptual, not actual inter-contract entanglement).

### Outline & Function Summary:

1.  **State Variables:** Store core data like owner, qubit state (values and weights), measured state, measurement status, authorized measurers, seed commitments, etc.
2.  **Events:** Signal important actions like state initialization, gate application, measurement, lock state changes.
3.  **Modifiers:** Control access based on ownership, measurement status, and measurer authorization.
4.  **Constructor:** Initializes the owner.
5.  **Configuration / Initialization Functions (4):**
    *   `initializeQubitState(uint256 _value0, uint256 _weight0, uint256 _value1, uint256 _weight1)`: Sets the two possible values and their initial weights in the superposition.
    *   `setProtectedStateInitial(uint256 _initialState)`: Sets the initial value of the protected state variable.
    *   `authorizeMeasurer(address _measurer)`: Grants permission for an address to call `measureQubit`.
    *   `revokeMeasurer(address _measurer)`: Revokes permission for an address.
6.  **Simulated Quantum Gate Functions (4):**
    *   `applyHadamardGate()`: Simulates a Hadamard gate, aiming weights towards 50/50 (approximated).
    *   `applyPauliXGate()`: Simulates a Pauli-X gate, swapping the weights of state 0 and state 1.
    *   `applyCustomGate(uint256 _weight0Multiplier, uint256 _weight1Multiplier)`: Applies custom multipliers to the current weights.
    *   `batchApplyGates(uint8[] memory _gateTypes, uint256[] memory _params)`: Applies multiple gates in a single transaction (requires careful encoding of params).
7.  **Measurement Functions (3):**
    *   `measureQubit(bytes32 _seed)`: The core function. Takes a seed, uses it with block data to deterministically pick one state based on current weights, collapses the superposition, sets `measuredValue`. Can only be called once unless reset.
    *   `resetMeasurement()`: Allows the owner to reset the contract to the pre-measurement state (allows re-measuring).
    *   `commitToMeasurementSeed(bytes32 _seedHash)`: Allows users to commit the hash of a seed for a future measurement round.
    *   `revealMeasurementSeed(bytes32 _seed)`: Allows users to reveal a previously committed seed (can be used as an input to `measureQubit`).
8.  **State & Access Functions (4):**
    *   `getQubitStateDescription() view`: Returns the current superposition state (potential values and weights).
    *   `getMeasuredValue() view`: Returns the value the qubit collapsed to after measurement. Reverts if not measured.
    *   `isMeasured() view`: Returns true if the qubit has been measured.
    *   `getProtectedState() view`: Returns the value of the protected state variable.
9.  **Conditional Execution Functions (5):**
    *   `updateProtectedState(uint256 _newValue)`: Updates the protected state, only allowed if the contract *has been* measured and the `measuredValue` meets a specific condition (e.g., equals state 1 value).
    *   `triggerConditionalAction()`: Executes a placeholder action (e.g., emit event) only if a specific post-measurement condition is met.
    *   `transferOwnershipConditional(address _newOwner)`: Transfers ownership only if the `measuredValue` matches a predefined value.
    *   `requestStateVerification(bytes32 _externalDataHash)`: Allows anyone to conceptually request verification of the *current* state against some external data (placeholder).
    *   `conceptuallyEntangleLock(address _targetContract)`: Records a link to another contract and emits an event, suggesting an "entanglement" effect upon measurement. Does not call the other contract directly.
10. **Utility / Information Functions (2):**
    *   `getAuthorizedMeasurers() view`: Returns the list of addresses authorized to measure.
    *   `getCurrentSeedCommitment(address _committer) view`: Returns the active seed commitment hash for a user.
