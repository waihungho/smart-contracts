/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A cutting-edge smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery.
 *      This contract incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic NFT metadata,
 *      AI-driven art curation (simulated), decentralized exhibitions,
 *      artist reputation scores, community voting for art acquisition,
 *      and innovative revenue distribution mechanisms.
 *      It aims to be a fully autonomous and community-governed art ecosystem.
 *
 * Function Outline:
 *
 * 1. initializeGallery(string _galleryName, string _gallerySymbol): Initializes the gallery with a name and symbol.
 * 2. setGalleryDescription(string _description): Sets the description of the art gallery.
 * 3. createArtistProfile(string _artistName, string _artistBio, string _artistWebsite): Allows artists to create their profiles.
 * 4. submitArtwork(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash, uint256 _initialPrice): Artists submit artwork for consideration.
 * 5. getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 * 6. getRandomArtworkId(): Returns a random artwork ID from the available pool.
 * 7. voteForArtworkAcquisition(uint256 _artworkId): Community members vote to acquire submitted artwork for the gallery.
 * 8. getArtworkAcquisitionVotes(uint256 _artworkId): Retrieves the current vote count for a specific artwork acquisition.
 * 9. finalizeArtworkAcquisition(uint256 _artworkId): Finalizes the acquisition of an artwork if it meets the voting threshold.
 * 10. listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _salePrice): Gallery owner lists acquired artwork for sale.
 * 11. buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to purchase artwork listed for sale.
 * 12. offerArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _offerPrice): Allows users to make offers on artworks not currently for sale.
 * 13. acceptOffer(uint256 _artworkId, address _offerer): Gallery owner accepts a specific offer on an artwork.
 * 14. createExhibition(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256[] _artworkIds): Creates a curated exhibition of artworks.
 * 15. getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId): Retrieves details about a specific exhibition.
 * 16. simulateAICurationScore(uint256 _artworkId): Simulates an AI curation score for an artwork (demonstrates concept).
 * 17. getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress): Retrieves the reputation score of an artist.
 * 18. rewardActiveVoters(uint256 _voterCount): Rewards active voters with governance tokens (demonstrates community incentives).
 * 19. setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Sets the platform fee percentage for sales.
 * 20. withdrawGalleryBalance(): Allows the gallery owner to withdraw the accumulated balance (platform fees).
 * 21. pauseContract(): Allows the contract owner to pause critical functions in case of emergency.
 * 22. unpauseContract(): Allows the contract owner to unpause the contract.
