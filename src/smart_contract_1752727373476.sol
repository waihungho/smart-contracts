Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's design a smart contract called "ChronoForge" â€“ a protocol for creating and managing highly customizable, time-gated, and event-contingent agreements, with a focus on advanced conditional logic and multi-stage execution. It goes beyond simple vesting or escrows by allowing complex combinations of on-chain data, oracle feeds, and even chained agreements to trigger actions.

It focuses on "Programmable Trust" where actions are executed only when a set of predefined, verifiable conditions are met over time or based on external events.

## ChronoForge Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Overview:** High-level description of ChronoForge's purpose.
2.  **Core Concepts:** Explanation of key structs and enums.
3.  **Interfaces:** External contracts ChronoForge interacts with.
4.  **State Variables:** Main storage for agreements, roles, and settings.
5.  **Events:** Signaling significant actions.
6.  **Modifiers:** Access control and validation.
7.  **Constructor:** Initialization.
8.  **Agreement Management Functions:** Create, update, cancel, activate agreements.
9.  **Condition & Action Management Functions:** Add/remove specific triggers and outputs.
10. **Execution & Claim Functions:** Triggering and claiming agreement outputs.
11. **Dispute Resolution Functions:** Mechanisms for resolving conflicts.
12. **Role Management Functions:** Assigning and revoking special permissions.
13. **Protocol Settings Functions:** Admin controls for fees, target contracts etc.
14. **Utility & View Functions:** Reading agreement states and details.

**Function Summary (At least 20 unique functions):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract with an owner.
2.  `createTemporalAgreement()`: Initiates a new multi-stage, time/event-contingent agreement.
3.  `depositForAgreement()`: Deposits assets (ETH/ERC20) into a specific agreement for later distribution.
4.  `updateTemporalAgreementDetails()`: Allows creators to modify agreement details before activation.
5.  `addConditionToAgreement()`: Adds a specific trigger condition (time, oracle, event, external verifier) to an agreement.
6.  `removeConditionFromAgreement()`: Removes a condition from an agreement (if not active).
7.  `addActionToAgreement()`: Defines an action (token transfer, contract call) to be executed upon conditions met.
8.  `removeActionFromAgreement()`: Removes an action from an agreement (if not active).
9.  `activateTemporalAgreement()`: Changes an agreement's status from PENDING to ACTIVE, enabling its conditions to be checked.
10. `cancelTemporalAgreement()`: Allows the creator or owner to cancel an agreement under specific conditions (e.g., before active, or if all parties agree).
11. `executeTemporalAgreementLogic()`: The core function called to check if an agreement's conditions are met. This is often called by a keeper or automated system.
12. `claimAgreementOutput()`: Allows the recipient to claim assets or trigger actions once an agreement is deemed `ReadyForExecution`.
13. `withdrawUnusedFunds()`: Allows the creator to withdraw any remaining funds from a cancelled or fully executed agreement.
14. `assignVerifierRole()`: Grants a specific address the role of an `AgreementVerifier` (can call `executeTemporalAgreementLogic`).
15. `revokeVerifierRole()`: Revokes the `AgreementVerifier` role.
16. `setOracleAddress()`: Sets the address of the trusted oracle contract for data feeds.
17. `setExternalLogicVerifierAddress()`: Sets the address of a contract that handles complex, external boolean logic for conditions.
18. `proposeArbitrator()`: Initiates a proposal for an arbitrator to resolve a specific agreement dispute.
19. `approveArbitrator()`: Allows involved parties to approve a proposed arbitrator.
20. `resolveDispute()`: The chosen arbitrator's function to settle a dispute and determine the agreement's final outcome.
21. `initiateLivenessCheck()`: Initiates a "liveness check" for a recipient, requiring them to prove activity within a timeframe or risk agreement cancellation.
22. `submitLivenessProof()`: Allows a recipient to submit proof of their "liveness" for a specific agreement.
23. `linkTemporalAgreements()`: Establishes a dependency where the successful execution of one agreement triggers another.
24. `setExecutionFee()`: Owner function to set a fee for successful agreement executions.
25. `withdrawFees()`: Owner function to withdraw accumulated protocol fees.
26. `transferOwnership()`: Standard OpenZeppelin ownership transfer.
