 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC)
 * @author Your Name (Conceptual - Replace with your actual details)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) that allows artists to submit artwork,
 * members to vote on artwork acceptance, curate exhibitions, participate in collaborative art projects, and more.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Membership and Governance:**
 *    - Join the Collective (Membership Request & Approval)
 *    - Leave the Collective
 *    - Stake Tokens for Voting Power
 *    - Propose Governance Changes
 *    - Vote on Governance Changes
 * 2. **Art Submission and Curation:**
 *    - Submit Art Proposal (with metadata)
 *    - Vote on Art Proposal Acceptance
 *    - Set Art Rarity Level (by curator)
 *    - View Accepted Artworks
 *    - Remove Art Proposal (before acceptance)
 * 3. **Exhibitions and Events:**
 *    - Create Exhibition Proposal
 *    - Vote on Exhibition Proposal
 *    - Set Exhibition Curator (by DAO vote)
 *    - View Active Exhibitions
 *    - End Exhibition and Distribute Rewards (if any)
 * 4. **Collaborative Art:**
 *    - Initiate Collaborative Art Project
 *    - Contribute to Collaborative Art Project
 *    - Finalize Collaborative Art Piece
 * 5. **Tokenomics and Treasury:**
 *    - Donate to Collective Treasury
 *    - Withdraw Funds from Treasury (governance vote required)
 *    - Set Platform Fee (governance vote required)
 *    - Distribute Exhibition Rewards
 * 6. **Randomness and Unique Features:**
 *    - Randomly Select Curator for Exhibition (using blockhash for simplicity - consider Chainlink VRF for production)
 *    - Create Limited Edition Series of Artworks
 *    - Burn Art NFT (with governance)
 * 7. **Utility and Information:**
 *    - Get Collective Member Count
 *    - Get Art Proposal Count
 *    - Get Exhibition Proposal Count
 *    - Get Collective Treasury Balance
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * 1. `joinCollective(string memory _artistStatement)`: Allows an address to request membership to the collective with an artist statement.
 * 2. `approveMembership(address _member)`: Allows current members to approve a pending membership request.
 * 3. `leaveCollective()`: Allows a member to leave the collective.
 * 4. `stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to stake governance tokens to increase voting power.
 * 5. `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to unstake governance tokens.
 * 6. `proposeGovernanceChange(string memory _proposalDescription, bytes memory _functionCallData)`: Allows members to propose changes to the contract's governance parameters.
 * 7. `voteOnGovernanceChange(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on a governance change proposal.
 * 8. `submitArtProposal(string memory _artTitle, string memory _artDescription, string memory _artHash)`: Allows members to submit art proposals with title, description, and IPFS hash.
 * 9. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on art proposals.
 * 10. `setArtRarityLevel(uint256 _artId, uint8 _rarity)`: Allows curators to set the rarity level of accepted artworks.
 * 11. `viewAcceptedArtworks()`: Returns a list of IDs of accepted artworks.
 * 12. `removeArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer to remove their art proposal before it's accepted.
 * 13. `createExhibitionProposal(string memory _exhibitionTitle, string memory _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows members to propose exhibitions with title, description, start and end times.
 * 14. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Allows members to vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 15. `setExhibitionCurator(uint256 _exhibitionId, address _curator)`: Allows setting a curator for an exhibition, typically through a DAO vote.
 * 16. `viewActiveExhibitions()`: Returns a list of IDs of active exhibitions.
 * 17. `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Allows ending an exhibition and potentially distributing rewards.
 * 18. `initiateCollaborativeArtProject(string memory _projectName, string memory _projectDescription)`: Allows members to initiate collaborative art projects.
 * 19. `contributeToCollaborativeArtProject(uint256 _projectId, string memory _contributionDetails)`: Allows members to contribute to ongoing collaborative art projects.
 * 20. `finalizeCollaborativeArtPiece(uint256 _projectId, string memory _finalArtHash)`: Allows finalizing a collaborative art piece and associating a final IPFS hash.
 * 21. `donateToCollective()`: Allows anyone to donate ETH to the collective treasury.
 * 22. `withdrawFundsFromTreasury(uint256 _amount)`: Allows members to propose withdrawals from the treasury (needs governance vote in a real-world scenario).
 * 23. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Allows governance to set the platform fee percentage for art sales.
 * 24. `distributeExhibitionRewards(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Distributes rewards associated with an exhibition to curators or participating artists.
 * 25. `randomlySelectCuratorForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Randomly selects a curator from collective members for an exhibition.
 * 26. `createLimitedEditionSeries(uint256 _artId, uint256 _editionSize)`: Creates a limited edition series of an accepted artwork (NFTs).
 * 27. `burnArtNFT(uint256 _artId)`: Allows burning (destroying) an Art NFT with governance approval.
 * 28. `getCollectiveMemberCount()`: Returns the number of members in the collective.
 * 29. `getArtProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of art proposals submitted.
 * 30. `getExhibitionProposalCount()`: Returns the total number of exhibition proposals submitted.
 * 31. `getCollectiveTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective treasury.
