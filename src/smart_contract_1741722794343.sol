 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) that allows artists to submit artwork,
 *      members to vote on artwork acceptance, manage a treasury, curate exhibitions, and engage in community governance.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Membership & Roles:**
 * 1. `joinCollective()`: Allows anyone to request membership to the DAAC. Requires approval by existing members.
 * 2. `approveMembership(address _member)`: Allows collective owners to approve pending membership requests.
 * 3. `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows collective owners to revoke membership from an existing member.
 * 4. `isMember(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a member of the DAAC.
 * 5. `isCollectiveOwner(address _account)`: Checks if an address is a collective owner (admin).
 * 6. `addCollectiveOwner(address _newOwner)`: Allows current collective owners to add new owners.
 * 7. `removeCollectiveOwner(address _ownerToRemove)`: Allows collective owners to remove other owners (cannot remove themselves).
 *
 * **Art Submission & Curation:**
 * 8. `submitArtProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Members can submit art proposals with title, description, and IPFS hash.
 * 9. `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on pending art proposals (true for approve, false for reject).
 * 10. `getArtProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the current status of an art proposal (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
 * 11. `mintArtNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: If an art proposal is approved, collective owners can mint an NFT representing the artwork and transfer it to the artist.
 * 12. `rejectArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows collective owners to manually reject an art proposal even if voting is not finished (in exceptional cases).
 * 13. `getApprovedArtCount()`: Returns the total number of approved artworks in the collective.
 * 14. `getArtProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific art proposal.
 *
 * **Exhibition Management:**
 * 15. `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256[] memory _artworkIds)`: Collective owners can create exhibitions by selecting approved artworks.
 * 16. `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Collective owners can add more artworks to an existing exhibition.
 * 17. `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Collective owners can remove artworks from an exhibition.
 * 18. `getExhibitionArtworks(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves the list of artwork IDs in a specific exhibition.
 * 19. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details about a specific exhibition, including name and artworks.
 *
 * **Treasury & Funding (Conceptual - Can be extended):**
 * 20. `depositToTreasury()`: Allows anyone to deposit ETH into the collective's treasury.
 * 21. `withdrawFromTreasury(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows collective owners to withdraw ETH from the treasury (for collective expenses, artist funding, etc.).
 * 22. `getTreasuryBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective's treasury.
 *
 * **Governance & Community (Basic Example - Can be expanded with more sophisticated DAO mechanisms):**
 * 23. `submitGovernanceProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Members can submit governance proposals for collective decisions.
 * 24. `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Members can vote on governance proposals.
 * 25. `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: If a governance proposal passes, collective owners can execute it (implementation details would depend on the proposal type).
 * 26. `getGovernanceProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves the status of a governance proposal.
 * 27. `getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a governance proposal.
 *
 * **Events:**
 * - `MembershipRequested(address indexed member)`: Emitted when a new membership is requested.
 * - `MembershipApproved(address indexed member, address indexed approvedBy)`: Emitted when a membership is approved.
 * - `MembershipRevoked(address indexed member, address indexed revokedBy)`: Emitted when a membership is revoked.
 * - `ArtProposalSubmitted(uint256 proposalId, address indexed proposer, string title)`: Emitted when an art proposal is submitted.
 * - `ArtProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address indexed voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on an art proposal.
 * - `ArtProposalApproved(uint256 proposalId)`: Emitted when an art proposal is approved.
 * - `ArtProposalRejected(uint256 proposalId)`: Emitted when an art proposal is rejected.
 * - `ArtNFTMinted(uint256 proposalId, address indexed artist, uint256 tokenId)`: Emitted when an art NFT is minted.
 * - `ExhibitionCreated(uint256 exhibitionId, string name)`: Emitted when a new exhibition is created.
 * - `ArtworkAddedToExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId, uint256 artworkId)`: Emitted when an artwork is added to an exhibition.
 * - `ArtworkRemovedFromExhibition(uint256 exhibitionId, uint256 artworkId)`: Emitted when an artwork is removed from an exhibition.
 * - `GovernanceProposalSubmitted(uint256 proposalId, address indexed proposer, string title)`: Emitted when a governance proposal is submitted.
 * - `GovernanceProposalVoted(uint256 proposalId, address indexed voter, bool vote)`: Emitted when a member votes on a governance proposal.
 * - `GovernanceProposalExecuted(uint256 proposalId)`: Emitted when a governance proposal is executed.
 * - `TreasuryDeposit(address indexed sender, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when funds are deposited to the treasury.
 * - `TreasuryWithdrawal(address indexed recipient, uint256 amount, address indexed withdrawnBy)`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn from the treasury.
