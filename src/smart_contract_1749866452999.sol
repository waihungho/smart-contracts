Okay, here is a smart contract called `QuantumVault`. It incorporates several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts like state-based conditional withdrawals, simulated external conditions/interactions as withdrawal triggers, a social recovery mechanism, and tiered access controls beyond just a single owner.

It aims to be non-duplicative by combining these concepts in a unique "vault" structure where the ability to withdraw depends on the "state" of the deposit, which can be influenced by time, simulated external conditions, or interactions with other users.

/**
 * @title QuantumVault
 * @dev A vault contract with complex, state-based conditional withdrawals,
 *      simulated external triggers (conditions/interactions), and social recovery.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1. Core Vault Functionality: Deposit, view deposits, get balances.
 * 2. Deposit State Management: Define different states and their rules.
 * 3. Conditional Withdrawal Logic: Implement withdrawal based on deposit state and external factors.
 * 4. Simulated External Triggers: Functions to simulate conditions being met or interactions occurring.
 * 5. Social Recovery: Mechanism for guardians to help recover ownership.
 * 6. Admin Controls: Pause, unpause, owner management.
 * 7. Events: Log key actions.
 * 8. Constants & State Variables.
 * 9. Modifiers.

/**
 * @notice Summary of Functions:
 * - constructor: Sets initial owner.
 * - deposit: Allows users to deposit ETH with an initial state.
 * - attemptWithdrawal: Attempts to withdraw a specific deposit based on its current state and conditions.
 * - _checkWithdrawalConditions: Internal helper to evaluate withdrawal rules for a deposit.
 * - proveInteraction: Allows a user to record an interaction with another address (simulated trigger).
 * - markConditionMet: (Owner-only) Simulates an external condition being met globally.
 * - changeDepositStateOwner: (Owner-only) Allows owner to change the state of any deposit.
 * - addRecoveryGuardian: (Owner-only) Adds an address to the social recovery guardian list.
 * - removeRecoveryGuardian: (Owner-only) Removes an address from the social recovery guardian list.
 * - submitRecoveryApproval: Allows a designated guardian to approve an owner recovery request.
 * - resetRecoveryApprovals: Resets recovery approval counts (after success or owner cancel).
 * - recoverOwner: Executes the social recovery process if enough guardian approvals are met.
 * - pause: (Owner-only) Pauses certain contract operations.
 * - unpause: (Owner-only) Unpauses the contract.
 * - emergencyWithdrawOwner: (Owner-only) Allows owner to withdraw ETH in emergencies (bypasses state rules).

 * - getDepositDetails: Returns the details of a specific deposit for a user.
 * - getTotalUserBalance: Returns the total deposited balance for a user.
 * - getTotalVaultBalance: Returns the total ETH held in the contract.
 * - isRecoveryGuardian: Checks if an address is a recovery guardian.
 * - getRecoveryGuardianCount: Returns the number of registered guardians.
