/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example Implementation)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for managing a decentralized art collective.
 *      This contract incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic roles, decentralized curation,
 *      algorithmic art generation (placeholder - requires external integration),
 *      NFT fractionalization, and on-chain reputation system.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Collective Management:**
 *    - `joinCollective(string _artistName, string _artistStatement)`: Allows artists to apply to join the collective.
 *    - `leaveCollective()`: Allows members to leave the collective.
 *    - `kickMember(address _member)`: Curators can initiate a vote to kick a member.
 *    - `voteOnMemberKick(address _member, bool _vote)`: Members vote on kicking a proposed member.
 *    - `getMemberDetails(address _member)`: Retrieves detailed information about a collective member.
 *    - `getCollectiveMemberCount()`: Returns the current number of members in the collective.
 *
 * **2. Curation and Artwork Submission:**
 *    - `submitArtwork(string _title, string _description, string _ipfsHash)`: Members submit artwork proposals for curation.
 *    - `voteOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, bool _vote)`: Members vote on submitted artwork for acceptance into the collective's collection.
 *    - `getCurationStatus(uint256 _artworkId)`: Checks the current curation status of an artwork proposal.
 *    - `mintArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Mints an NFT for an accepted artwork, only after successful curation.
 *    - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves details of a specific artwork proposal.
 *    - `getApprovedArtworksCount()`: Returns the count of artworks approved by the curation process.
 *
 * **3. Algorithmic Art Integration (Placeholder):**
 *    - `generateAlgorithmicArt(string _seed)`: (Placeholder - would require oracle or external execution) Triggers the generation of algorithmic art based on a seed.
 *    - `storeAlgorithmicArtMetadata(string _metadataURI)`: (Placeholder - for off-chain generated art) Stores metadata URI for externally generated algorithmic art.
 *
 * **4. NFT Fractionalization (Advanced Feature):**
 *    - `fractionalizeNFT(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _fractionCount)`: Allows the collective to fractionalize a curated NFT into multiple ERC20 tokens.
 *    - `redeemNFTFraction(uint256 _fractionId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Allows holders of NFT fractions to redeem a portion of the original NFT (complex logic and considerations).
 *    - `getFractionDetails(uint256 _fractionId)`: Retrieves details about a specific NFT fraction.
 *
 * **5. Reputation and Dynamic Roles:**
 *    - `upvoteMember(address _member)`: Members can upvote other members to increase their reputation.
 *    - `downvoteMember(address _member)`: Members can downvote other members, potentially affecting their role.
 *    - `assignCuratorRole(address _member)`: Curators can propose assigning curator roles to reputable members.
 *    - `voteOnCuratorAssignment(address _member, bool _vote)`: Members vote on proposed curator assignments.
 *    - `removeCuratorRole(address _curator)`: Curators can propose removing curator roles.
 *    - `voteOnCuratorRemoval(address _curator, bool _vote)`: Members vote on proposed curator removals.
 *    - `getMemberReputation(address _member)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a member.
 *    - `isCurator(address _member)`: Checks if a member has curator role.
 *
 * **6. Governance & Parameters:**
 *    - `setQuorumForCuration(uint256 _newQuorum)`: Curators can propose and vote to change the curation quorum.
 *    - `setVotingDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`: Curators can propose and vote to change the voting duration.
 *    - `getParameter(string _paramName)`: Allows retrieval of governance parameters (e.g., quorum, voting duration).
 *
 * **7. Emergency and Utility:**
 *    - `pauseContract()`: Owner can pause critical contract functions in case of emergency.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`: Owner can unpause the contract.
 *    - `emergencyWithdraw(address _recipient)`: Owner can withdraw stuck Ether in extreme emergency.
 *    - `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.
