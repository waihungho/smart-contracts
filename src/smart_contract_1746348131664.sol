Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a "Quantum Locker". The concept is that users can deposit ERC-20 tokens into individual "locker slots," but access (withdrawal) is conditional upon specific "quantum states" being measured. These states are determined by a combination of on-chain conditions (like time) and potentially off-chain data accessed via an oracle (like price feeds). The "measurement" is a specific transaction that resolves the state of a locker slot.

This concept incorporates:
*   **Programmable Access:** Conditions dictate withdrawal, not just a fixed time or single recipient.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Combining multiple conditions (AND/OR).
*   **External Data Dependency:** Using oracles for real-world data (trendy).
*   **State Management:** Tracking the "quantum state" of each locker slot.
*   **Role-Based Access:** Owner for configuration, users for interaction, potentially permitted measurers.
*   **Unique Framing:** The "quantum" metaphor provides a creative angle.

We will need an interface for an external price oracle. For simplicity, this example assumes a basic oracle structure.

Outline:
1.  Contract Ownership (Basic implementation, not relying on OpenZeppelin for strict non-duplication)
2.  Interfaces (ERC20, basic Oracle)
3.  Enums (ConditionType, LockerState, ConditionLogic)
4.  Structs (ConditionParameters, LockerSlot)

    -   Mapping for addresses allowed to trigger measurement
6.  Events

**Explanation:**

1.  **Quantum Metaphor:** The "quantum state" of a locker slot is its `LockerState`. The state transitions depend on "measurements" (calls to `measureLockerState`). The `ConditionParameters` define the criteria for the "quantum measurement" to resolve to `ResolvedSuccess` (like observing a particle in a specific spin state). The `ConditionLogic` represents the interaction between multiple conditions (like entangled particles needing specific correlated outcomes).
2.  **Core Mechanics:**
    *   `createLockerSlot()`: Anyone can create a slot by paying a fee, becoming the *locker owner*. This slot starts in `Initialized`.
    *   `depositToken()`: The locker owner (or anyone approved by the locker owner via `approve` on the ERC20) can deposit tokens into the slot. State moves to `TokensDeposited` if conditions were already set, otherwise stays `Initialized`.
    *   `setLockerConditions()`, `addLockerCondition()`, `removeLockerCondition()`, `setConditionLogic()`: The locker owner configures the "quantum conditions" and their logical combination (AND/OR). This moves the state to `ConditionsSet` if there are tokens or if this is the first time conditions are set from `Initialized`.
    *   `measureLockerState()`: This is the "quantum measurement" trigger. It can only be called by addresses explicitly allowed by the contract's `owner` via `setMeasurementAllowedAddress()`. It evaluates all conditions based on the set logic (`checkConditionInternal`) and transitions the state to `ResolvedSuccess` or `ResolvedFailure`.
    *   `withdraw()`: The locker owner can claim the tokens if and only if the state is `ResolvedSuccess`.
3.  **Conditions:** The `ConditionType` enum defines various ways to check state:
    *   Time-based (`TimestampGreaterThan`, `TimestampLessThan`).
    *   Oracle-based (`PriceAbove`, `PriceBelow`) - requires an oracle address to be set by the contract owner.
    *   Internal/Conceptual (`BooleanFlagIsSet`) - a simple placeholder, could be expanded.
    *   Internal to the locker (`TokenBalanceGreaterThan`) - checks the balance of a specific token *within* that specific locker slot.
4.  **States:** The `LockerState` enum tracks the lifecycle: `Initialized`, `ConditionsSet`, `TokensDeposited`, `Resolving` (briefly), `ResolvedSuccess`, `ResolvedFailure`, `Withdrawn`, `Canceled`.
5.  **Access Control:**
    *   Contract `owner`: Manages the contract's configuration (oracle, fees, measurement permissions, sweeping failed lockers).
    *   Locker `owner`: The creator of a specific locker slot. They can set conditions, deposit tokens, and withdraw if successful.
    *   Measurement Allowed Addresses: A permissioned list of addresses that can trigger the `measureLockerState` function. This decouples the measurement trigger from the locker owner or contract owner, potentially allowing decentralized or automated measurement services.
6.  **Non-Duplication:** While using standard patterns like ownership and ERC-20 interaction, the core logic of programmable, multi-conditional access triggered by a distinct "measurement" transaction, combined with the unique "Quantum Locker" framing and state machine, distinguishes it from typical timelocks, vesting contracts, or simple escrows. The combination of condition types, logic types, measurement permissions, and distinct states creates a more advanced and specific mechanism.

This contract provides a flexible framework for creating conditional token releases or escrows based on diverse criteria, with a unique conceptual twist. Remember that deploying such a contract requires careful consideration of oracle reliability, gas costs for complex condition evaluation, and potential edge cases.
