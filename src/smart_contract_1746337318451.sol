Okay, let's create a smart contract that implements a complex locking mechanism inspired metaphorically by quantum states and observation. We'll call it `QuantumLock`. The core idea is that funds are locked based on conditions that depend on variables (`qStateValue1`, `qStateValue2`) whose final values are uncertain until an "observation" event occurs, typically triggered by a trusted oracle.

This is a metaphorical use of "quantum" concepts (superposition/uncertainty before observation, state collapse upon measurement/observation) applied to smart contract logic. It's a novel locking mechanism not commonly found in simple open-source examples, relying on external input (oracle) to resolve the lock state.

Here is the smart contract code:

// --- Contract: QuantumLock ---
// Description:
// A smart contract allowing users to lock ETH or ERC20 tokens under complex,
// state-dependent conditions. The conditions rely on two "Quantum State"
// values (qStateValue1, qStateValue2) which are initially zero/uncertain.
// These values are resolved and fixed only when a designated "Oracle"
// makes an "Observation". Once observed, the lock's unlock conditions
// can be evaluated based on the fixed qState values and other factors like time.
// This contract implements a metaphorical "quantum" lock where the unlock state
// is uncertain until an external "measurement" (observation) collapses the
// state, making unlockability deterministic.

// 2. Enums
// 3. Structs
// 4. Events
// 5. Modifiers
// 6. Core Logic (Constructor, createLock)
// 7. Lock Management Functions (add/remove condition, transfer/renounce ownership, cancel)
// 8. Oracle Management Functions (add/remove oracle, check if oracle)

// 10. Unlock Functions (attemptUnlock, checkLockStatus, checkConditionMet)
// 11. Getter/View Functions (get lock details, conditions, counts, etc.)
// 12. Helper Internal Functions (_checkConditions)

// --- Function Summary ---
// 1. constructor(): Initializes the contract owner.

// 3. addConditionToLock(uint256 lockId, UnlockCondition condition): Adds an unlock condition to an unobserved lock.
// 4. removeConditionFromLock(uint256 lockId, uint256 conditionIndex): Removes an unlock condition from an unobserved lock.
// 5. transferLockOwnership(uint256 lockId, address newOwner): Transfers ownership of a lock configuration to a new address (before observation).
// 6. renounceLockOwnership(uint256 lockId): Allows a lock owner to give up control (before observation).

// 11. makeObservation(uint256 lockId, uint256 value1, uint256 value2): An oracle resolves the quantum state for a lock by setting qStateValue1 and qStateValue2.
// 12. attemptUnlock(uint256 lockId): Attempts to unlock a lock by checking if all conditions are met after observation.
// 13. checkLockStatus(uint256 lockId): View function: Checks if a lock is observed and if its current conditions evaluate to true based on the resolved state.

**Explanation of Concepts and Functionality:**

1.  **Quantum Metaphor:** The contract uses `qStateValue1` and `qStateValue2` as variables whose values are initially unknown (like a quantum state in superposition). They are only determined and fixed when an `ObservationMade` event occurs via the `makeObservation` function, called by a registered `Oracle`. This moment is the "measurement" that "collapses" the state, making the unlockability deterministic based on these fixed values.
2.  **Flexible Conditions:** The `UnlockCondition` struct and enums (`ConditionType`, `ComparisonType`) allow defining various rules:
    *   `TimeBased`: Check if `block.timestamp` is equal to, greater than, less than, etc., a target time.
    *   `ValueBased`: (Currently a placeholder comparing against a fixed value 1) This type is intended to be extended to check against *other* contract states or fixed values.
    *   `QStateBased`: Crucially, conditions can rely on the *resolved* `qStateValue1` or `qStateValue2` using standard comparisons.
    *   All defined conditions must be met for the lock to be unlocked.
3.  **Oracle System:** A basic system for registering and unregistering trusted addresses (`registeredOracles`) is included. Only these oracles can make observations (`makeObservation`) for specific locks. This external dependency is typical for bringing off-chain or unpredictable data into a smart contract context.
4.  **Lock Ownership vs. Asset Ownership:** The `lockOwner` variable refers to the address that has control over modifying the lock's conditions *before* observation. The actual assets are owned by the `QuantumLock` contract itself until successfully unlocked and sent to the `lockOwner` at that time.
5.  **State Transitions:** Locks move through states:
    *   Created (`!isObserved`, `!isUnlocked`)
    *   Observed (`isObserved = true`, `!isUnlocked`)
    *   Unlocked (`isObserved = true`, `isUnlocked = true`)
    *   Conditions (`addConditionToLock`, `removeConditionFromLock`) and configuration ownership (`transferLockOwnership`, `renounceLockOwnership`) can only be modified in the 'Created' state (`lockNotObserved` modifier).
    *   Observation (`makeObservation`) moves a lock from 'Created' to 'Observed'.
    *   Unlocking (`attemptUnlock`) moves a lock from 'Observed' to 'Unlocked' *only if* all conditions are met.
    *   Cancellation (`cancelLock`, `onlyOwner`) can happen only in the 'Created' state.
6.  **ETH and ERC20 Support:** The `createLock` function handles both native currency (ETH) via `payable` and ERC20 tokens using `transferFrom` (requiring prior approval).
7.  **Comprehensive Getters:** Numerous view functions are included to allow external parties (UIs, other contracts) to inspect the state of locks, conditions, oracle status, etc., without modifying state.
8.  **Error Handling and Events:** Appropriate `require` statements enforce rules, and events are emitted for key actions, providing a history and facilitating off-chain monitoring.
9.  **SafeMath:** Included via OpenZeppelin for protection against overflow/underflow, although `^0.8.0` includes these checks by default for standard arithmetic operations.

This contract goes beyond simple time or address-based locks by introducing a dynamic, oracle-dependent state resolution mechanism, fulfilling the requirement for an interesting, advanced, and creative concept. The structure includes well over 20 functions as requested.
