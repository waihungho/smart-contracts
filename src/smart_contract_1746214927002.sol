Okay, let's design a smart contract for a **Decentralized, Community-Curated Knowledge Base (Agora)**. This concept involves users submitting content entries (represented by hashes), and the community curating/validating them through voting, staking, and reputation. It combines elements of decentralized content moderation, gamified incentives, and token-gated access.

It's challenging to guarantee *zero* overlap with *any* open-source project, as many core mechanisms (like staking, voting, role management) are building blocks. However, the specific *combination* of these elements for a *curated knowledge base* with dynamic reputation tied to successful curation outcomes, slashing for bad actors, and NFT-based access control in a single contract aims for novelty beyond typical token, NFT, or simple DAO examples.

Here's the contract design:

// --- Function Summary ---
// Core Entry Management:
// - submitEntry(bytes32 _ipfsHash, bytes32 _metadataHash): Submits a new entry hash and metadata hash.
// - getEntry(uint256 _entryId): Retrieves details of a specific entry.
// - getEntryCount(): Gets the total number of entries submitted.
// - getEntryIdsByStatus(EntryStatus _status): Gets a list of entry IDs matching a specific status.
// - updateEntryStatus(uint256 _entryId, EntryStatus _newStatus): Allows moderators/validators to change entry status (internal use mostly, or for specific transitions).

// Curation & Validation:
// - voteOnEntry(uint256 _entryId, VoteType _vote): Allows users to vote up or down on a pending entry.
// - getUserVote(uint256 _entryId, address _user): Gets the user's vote on a specific entry.
// - getEntryCurationScore(uint256 _entryId): Gets the current curation score of an entry.
// - flagEntry(uint256 _entryId): Allows users to flag potentially problematic entries.
// - processFlaggedEntry(uint256 _entryId, EntryStatus _finalStatus): Moderator action to review and finalize a flagged entry.
// - approveEntry(uint256 _entryId): Publicly approve an entry (if conditions met, e.g., high score). Can also be a moderator/validator function depending on rules.
// - rejectEntry(uint256 _entryId): Publicly reject an entry (if conditions met, e.g., low score). Can also be a moderator/validator function.

// Reputation System:
// - getUserReputation(address _user): Gets the current reputation score of a user.
// - _updateReputation(address _user, int256 _change): Internal function to adjust user reputation.
// - _distributeReputationRewards(address _user, uint256 _amount): Internal function to reward reputation based on successful actions.
// - _deductReputation(address _user, uint256 _amount): Internal function to deduct reputation for negative actions.

// Staking & Incentives (Requires an ERC20 token, represented by IAgoraToken):
// - stakeTokens(uint256 _amount): Stakes tokens to become a validator/curator.
// - withdrawStake(uint256 _amount): Withdraws staked tokens (subject to cooldown/locks).
// - claimRewards(): Claims accumulated token rewards from curation/validation.
// - getUserStakedAmount(address _user): Gets the amount of tokens a user has staked.
// - getUserAvailableRewards(address _user): Gets the amount of rewards a user can claim.
// - _processRewardDistribution(address _user, uint256 _rewardAmount): Internal function to handle reward accrual.
// - _applySlashing(address _user, uint256 _percentage): Internal function to slash staked tokens.

// Access Control & Roles:
// - grantModeratorRole(address _user): Grants moderator privileges (Owner only).
// - revokeModeratorRole(address _user): Revokes moderator privileges (Owner only).
// - isModerator(address _user): Checks if an address has the moderator role.
// - setAccessPassNFT(address _nftContract): Sets the address of an ERC721 contract used for premium access (Owner only).
// - hasPremiumAccess(address _user): Checks if a user holds the designated Access Pass NFT. (Requires external call).

// Configuration & Admin:
// - setEntryFee(uint256 _fee): Sets the fee required to submit a new entry (Admin).
// - setValidationThreshold(int256 _score): Sets the minimum curation score for auto-approval (Admin).
// - setSlashingPercentage(uint256 _percentage): Sets the percentage of stake slashed for bad actions (Admin).
// - setRewardRate(uint256 _rate): Sets the rate at which rewards are generated (Admin).
// - withdrawFees(): Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated entry fees.

// Advanced Concepts:
// - Hybrid Curation: Entries go through a community voting phase and potentially a validator/moderator review phase.
// - Dynamic Reputation: Reputation increases/decreases based on contributing valuable content and successfully curating (voting in alignment with final status).
// - Staking & Slashing: Validators stake tokens and can be slashed for malicious or consistently poor validation/curation decisions (simulated slashing logic).
// - Token-Gated Access: Premium features or content access tied to holding a specific NFT (requires interaction with an external ERC721 contract).
// - Gamified Incentives: Users are incentivized with tokens and reputation for positive contributions and curation.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Concepts Used:**

1.  **Hybrid Curation & Validation:** Entries don't just get auto-approved by a single vote threshold. They have a community voting phase (`voteOnEntry`) which can *lead* to auto-approval/rejection (`approveEntry`/`rejectEntry`), or they can be `flagEntry`-ed for manual `processFlaggedEntry` by privileged moderators. This layered approach adds resilience against simple Sybil attacks on voting.
2.  **Dynamic Reputation System:** Users gain reputation (`_updateReputation`) not just for participation (like voting), but the *impact* of their actions matters (simulated by larger rep changes for successful submissions or moderator actions). This encourages quality contributions and helpful curation.
3.  **Staking and Outcome-Based Slashing (Simulated):** Users can `stakeTokens` to potentially gain validator status (modifier `requiresStake`). The `_applySlashing` function is included to demonstrate how stake could be penalized for malicious or consistently bad curation decisions (e.g., voting "Approved" on an entry later `processFlaggedEntry` as `Rejected`). The actual complex logic for determining *which* validators to slash based on outcome and linking votes to specific final statuses is omitted for code simplicity and gas efficiency, but the *concept* is included.
4.  **Token-Gated Access (`hasPremiumAccess` with ERC721):** The contract can be configured with an external `accessPassNFT` contract address. The `hasPremiumAccess` function checks if a user holds *any* token from that specific NFT collection. This allows gating certain features or content access (off-chain, based on this on-chain check) to NFT holders, enabling a premium tier or specific community membership. It demonstrates cross-contract interaction.
5.  **Gamified Incentives:** The combination of reputation points (`_updateReputation`, `_distributeReputationRewards`) and potential token rewards (`claimRewards`) for positive participation creates a gamified loop to encourage users to contribute and curate effectively.
6.  **Entry Lifecycle Management:** The `EntryStatus` enum and the `updateEntryStatus` internal function manage the state transitions of an entry (Pending -> Approved/Rejected/Flagged -> Processed), defining a clear process.
7.  **Storage Optimization Consideration:** Using `bytes32` for IPFS/metadata hashes is a common optimization over storing dynamic strings. The `entryIdsByStatus` mapping attempts to provide efficient querying of entry lists by status, although iterating over large arrays within the contract (like in the simplified `withdrawFees` or potential slashing logic) is highlighted as a potential gas concern in real-world applications.

This contract provides a robust framework for a decentralized knowledge base, incorporating several advanced concepts beyond basic token or NFT contracts, while meeting the function count requirement. Remember that for production use, more sophisticated indexing, gas optimizations (especially for iterating over data), and potentially off-chain components for heavy computation (like complex reward distribution or deep history checks) would be necessary.
