/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Conceptual and for educational purposes)
 * @notice This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective where members can create, curate, and manage digital art pieces.
 * It features advanced concepts like collaborative art creation, dynamic royalties, decentralized exhibitions, and a community-driven governance model for the art collective.
 * This is a conceptual example and is not audited for production use.
 *
 * Function Outline:
 *
 * **Core Art Piece Management:**
 * 1. `mintArtPiece(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows collective members to mint new digital art pieces (NFTs).
 * 2. `transferArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId, address _to)`: Transfers ownership of an art piece to another address.
 * 3. `getArtPieceDetails(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific art piece.
 * 4. `burnArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Allows the owner to burn (permanently destroy) an art piece.
 * 5. `setArtPieceMetadata(uint256 _artPieceId, string memory _ipfsHash)`: Allows the art piece owner to update the metadata (e.g., description, image) of their art piece.
 * 6. `collaborateOnArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId, address[] memory _collaborators)`: Enables multiple artists to be recognized as creators of a single art piece.
 *
 * **Collective Membership and Governance:**
 * 7. `joinCollective()`: Allows anyone to request membership in the art collective.
 * 8. `approveMembership(address _member)`: Allows existing members to vote to approve a new membership request.
 * 9. `revokeMembership(address _member)`: Allows members to vote to revoke membership from an existing member.
 * 10. `getCollectiveMembers()`: Returns a list of addresses of current collective members.
 * 11. `proposeCollectiveRuleChange(string memory _description, bytes memory _ruleData)`: Allows members to propose changes to the collective's rules or parameters.
 * 12. `voteOnRuleChangeProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows members to vote on proposed rule changes.
 * 13. `executeRuleChange(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a rule change proposal if it passes the voting threshold.
 *
 * **Decentralized Exhibitions:**
 * 14. `proposeExhibition(string memory _exhibitionTitle, string memory _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows members to propose new art exhibitions.
 * 15. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows members to vote on exhibition proposals.
 * 16. `executeExhibition(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes an exhibition if it passes the voting threshold.
 * 17. `addArtPieceToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artPieceId)`: Allows art piece owners to submit their art to an active exhibition.
 * 18. `removeArtPieceFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artPieceId)`: Allows art piece owners to withdraw their art from an exhibition.
 * 19. `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition, including participating art pieces.
 *
 * **Financial and Royalty Management:**
 * 20. `setDynamicRoyalty(uint256 _artPieceId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Allows the collective to set a dynamic royalty percentage for secondary sales of art pieces, potentially influenced by community votes or other factors (advanced concept).
 * 21. `withdrawCollectiveFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows authorized members (e.g., through governance) to withdraw funds from the collective treasury.
 * 22. `getCollectiveBalance()`: Returns the current balance of the collective treasury.
 * 23. `sponsorArtPiece(uint256 _artPieceId)`: Allows anyone to sponsor an art piece by sending ETH, supporting the artist.
