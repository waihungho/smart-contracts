 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery - "ArtVerse DAO"
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract implementing a decentralized autonomous art gallery
 * with advanced features for art submission, curation, exhibitions, auctions,
 * community governance, and innovative NFT functionalities.

 * Function Outline and Summary:

 * 1.  submitArtwork(string memory _title, string memory _artistName, string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _description, uint256 _suggestedPrice): Allows artists to submit artwork proposals to the gallery.
 * 2.  voteOnArtworkAcceptance(uint256 _artworkId, bool _approve): Curators vote on whether to accept submitted artworks into the gallery.
 * 3.  mintNFT(uint256 _artworkId): Mints an NFT for an accepted artwork, making it officially part of the gallery collection.
 * 4.  listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _price): Allows the gallery to list an artwork for sale at a fixed price.
 * 5.  buyArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to purchase artworks listed for sale.
 * 6.  createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, string memory _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, uint256[] memory _artworkIds): Curators can create themed exhibitions featuring selected artworks.
 * 7.  sponsorExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId): Allows users to sponsor an exhibition, providing funding that can be distributed to participating artists or the gallery DAO.
 * 8.  bidOnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Allows users to place bids on artworks that are put up for auction.
 * 9.  setAuctionDuration(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _durationInSeconds): Sets the duration of an auction for a specific artwork.
 * 10. participateInAuction(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _bidAmount): Allows users to participate in an ongoing auction by placing bids.
 * 11. endAuction(uint256 _artworkId): Ends an auction for an artwork, awarding it to the highest bidder.
 * 12. becomeCurator(): Allows users to apply to become curators, subject to community approval.
 * 13. voteOnCuratorApplication(address _applicant, bool _approve): Existing curators vote on new curator applications.
 * 14. proposeNewFeature(string memory _featureProposal, string memory _description): Allows curators to propose new features or changes to the gallery.
 * 15. voteOnFeatureProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve): Curators vote on proposed new features.
 * 16. executeFeatureProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Executes an approved feature proposal, potentially modifying contract parameters or functionality (requires careful implementation for security).
 * 17. withdrawFunds(uint256 _artworkId): Allows artists to withdraw earnings from sales of their artworks.
 * 18. setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Allows the gallery owner (DAO or governance) to set a platform fee percentage on sales.
 * 19. distributeGalleryFees(): Distributes collected gallery fees to a designated treasury or DAO.
 * 20. burnArtworkNFT(uint256 _artworkId): A feature to allow artists (or curators with governance approval) to burn an NFT, potentially for scarcity or artistic reasons.
 * 21. reportArtwork(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _reportReason): Allows users to report artworks for inappropriate content or copyright infringement.
 * 22. voteOnReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _removeArtwork): Curators vote on whether to remove reported artworks.
