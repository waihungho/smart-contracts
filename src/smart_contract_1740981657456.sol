/**
 * @title Delegated Escrow with Reputation-Based Dispute Resolution
 * @author Bard (An AI Assistant)
 * @notice This contract implements a delegated escrow system where funds are held until both parties (buyer and seller) agree on the outcome.
 *  It leverages a Reputation Oracle contract to resolve disputes fairly, basing the resolution on the reputation scores of both parties.
 *
 * @dev This contract introduces the concept of a "Reputation Oracle" (assumed to exist and addressable) to handle dispute resolution.  It also incorporates features like deadlines for acceptance, withdrawals for expired agreements, and detailed logging.  Consider this a conceptual framework; real-world implementation would require a robust and secure Reputation Oracle.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **State Variables:** Define key data storage.
 * 2.  **Events:**  Define events for important contract actions.
 * 3.  **Structs:** Define custom data structures (Escrow agreement details).
 * 4.  **Constructor:** Initializes the contract (sets the Reputation Oracle address).
 * 5.  **createEscrow():** Creates a new escrow agreement.
 * 6.  **depositFunds():**  Deposits funds into the escrow agreement.
 * 7.  **acceptTerms():** Allows a party to accept the escrow terms.
 * 8.  **releaseFunds():** Releases funds to the seller if both parties agree.
 * 9.  **dispute():**  Initiates a dispute.
 * 10. **resolveDispute():**  (Oracle-only) Resolves a dispute based on reputation scores.
 * 11. **withdrawExpired():** Allows the buyer to withdraw funds if the agreement expires.
 * 12. **getEscrowDetails():**  Retrieves details of an escrow agreement.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Reputation Oracle Integration:** The core concept is delegation of dispute resolution to a `Reputation Oracle`. This is crucial for "interesting, advanced-concept, creative and trendy" functionality. The contract *requires* the `reputationOracle` address at construction.  The `resolveDispute()` function can *only* be called by the `reputationOracle`.  This isolates the decision-making logic (how reputation affects outcomes) outside the Escrow contract, keeping it focused on fund management. *Important: This relies on a separately implemented Reputation Oracle that exists off-chain and updates/maintains on-chain reputation data*.
* **Agreement Deadline and Withdrawal:** The `Escrow` struct now includes a `deadline`.  The `withdrawExpired()` function allows the buyer to reclaim their funds if the agreement isn't completed by the deadline *and* both parties haven't agreed to the terms. This is a fair mechanism in cases where one party abandons the agreement. This requires all escrow amounts to be re-evaluated for expiry after being created.
* **Explicit `Escrow` Struct:**  Using a struct makes the data organization clear and improves readability.
* **Events:**  Comprehensive event logging is included to track all key actions.  Good for auditing and off-chain monitoring.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `require()` statements to enforce preconditions and provide informative error messages.
* **Dispute Resolution Flow:**
    * `dispute()` is called by either party, setting the `disputed` flag to `true`.  Funds *cannot* be withdrawn or released after a dispute is initiated.
    * The `reputationOracle` *somehow* (this part is outside the scope of the smart contract) determines the winner based on the reputation scores of the buyer and seller (and possibly other factors). *This is the most crucial and complex part of the system that isn't implemented directly in this Solidity code.*
    * The `reputationOracle` then calls `resolveDispute()`, passing in the `escrowId` and the address of the winner.
    * `resolveDispute()` transfers the funds to the winner and marks the escrow as `resolved`.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Re-entrancy protection:**  The contract uses  `selfdestruct`  to prevent re-entrancy attacks after fund transfers.  This approach is a simple but effective way to make the contract single-use after a final transfer.
    * **Ownership:**  Includes a commented-out section on ownership and modifying the agreement duration.  In a real deployment, you'd use something like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract to properly manage contract ownership.
* **`agreementDuration` Variable:**  Provides a global variable to control the duration of the escrow agreements.  Allows for adjusting the timeframe.
* **Clear Function Summaries:** Each function has a `notice` tag in its NatSpec comments explaining its purpose.
* **Example `getEscrowDetails()`:** Provides a public view function to retrieve all the details of an escrow, making it easy to inspect the contract's state.
* **Prevented Double Spends:** Added a check `require(!escrow.resolved, "Escrow has already been resolved");` to prevent a double spend on an escrow. Also mark as resolved and selfdestruct to prevent re-entrancy.
* **Dispute window:** Added TODO comment for preventing spam of disputes.
* **Prevent accepting expired agreements:** Added `require(block.timestamp < escrow.deadline, "Escrow is expired.");` at important function to prevent working with expired agreements.

To use this code:

1.  **Implement the Reputation Oracle:** This is the biggest task. You need a separate smart contract (or off-chain system) that can:
    * Store reputation scores for users.
    * Update those scores based on various criteria.
    * Determine a winner in a dispute based on the reputation scores of the buyer and seller.
    * Call `resolveDispute()` on the `DelegatedEscrow` contract with the correct `escrowId` and winner address.

2.  **Deploy the Contracts:** Deploy both the `DelegatedEscrow` contract and your `ReputationOracle` contract to your chosen blockchain.

3.  **Interact with the `DelegatedEscrow` Contract:** Users would then interact with the `DelegatedEscrow` contract to create and manage escrow agreements.  When a dispute arises, the `ReputationOracle` would handle the resolution.

This provides a much more complete and interesting solution that incorporates a trendy concept (reputation) and illustrates how smart contracts can interact with external oracles for complex decision-making.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract code before deploying it to a production environment.
