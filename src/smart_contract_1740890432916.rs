/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic NFT Lottery with Impact Funding
 * @author GeminiAI
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized lottery where tickets are represented as NFTs.
 * The lottery dynamics are adjusted based on the success of previous rounds and user participation.
 * A portion of the lottery proceeds is allocated to impact funding initiatives, chosen via on-chain voting.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - Constructor: Initializes the contract with initial parameters like ticket price, impact fund percentage, etc.
 *  - buyTicket(): Allows users to purchase lottery tickets (NFTs).
 *  - endLottery():  Ends the lottery round, draws the winning ticket, and distributes rewards.
 *  - withdrawRewards(): Allows winners to claim their rewards.
 *  - updateImpactFundChoices(): Allows the contract owner to update the possible impact funding recipient addresses.
 *  - voteForImpactFund(): Allows ticket holders to vote for their preferred impact fund.
 *  - distributeImpactFunds(): Distributes the impact fund proceeds to the winning impact fund recipient.
 *  - setTicketPrice(): Allows the contract owner to adjust the ticket price based on participation metrics.
 *  - setImpactFundPercentage(): Allows the contract owner to adjust the percentage of the lottery pot allocated to the impact fund.
 *  - getTokenURI(): Returns the URI for an NFT (ticket). The URI can be dynamic and reflect the lottery round and the winner.
 *
 * Advanced Concepts:
 *  - Dynamic Ticket Pricing: Adjusts ticket prices based on previous lottery round participation.
 *  - On-Chain Impact Fund Voting:  Allows ticket holders to vote for where a percentage of the lottery pot goes.
 *  - Dynamic NFT Metadata: TokenURI can include information about the impact fund winner and participation rates.
 *  - Lottery Adjustment: Next round adjustments to total tickets and prize pool based on previous round metrics.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`pragma solidity ^0.8.9;`**:  Crucially includes the pragma statement to specify the Solidity compiler version.  Using `^0.8.9` allows for compatible versions and helps avoid unexpected behavior.  Importantly, this version also lets me use `payable` when defining `address payable[]` which wasn't supported by older solidity versions.
* **Clear Function Summary:**  The function summary provides a high-level overview of the contract's purpose and functionality.
* **Advanced Concepts Highlighted:** The "Advanced Concepts" section explains the key innovative aspects of the contract.
* **NFT Representation:** The lottery tickets are represented as ERC721 NFTs, making them tradable and verifiable.
* **Dynamic Ticket Pricing:** The `setTicketPrice` and `setMaxTotalTickets` functions allow the owner to adjust the ticket price and maximum ticket amount based on participation in previous rounds, incentivizing higher participation and optimizing revenue.  The `startNextLotteryRound` function has logic to actually adjust those prices and ticket amounts dynamically.
* **On-Chain Impact Fund Voting:**  The `impactFundChoices`, `ticketToVote`, `impactFundVotes`, `voteForImpactFund`, and `distributeImpactFunds` functions enable ticket holders to vote for their preferred impact fund, increasing transparency and community involvement in the allocation of funds.  A key update is that `distributeImpactFunds()` handles the case where *no* votes are cast, distributing the funds evenly.
* **Dynamic NFT Metadata:** The `tokenURI` function returns a dynamically generated URI for each NFT, including information about the lottery round, winner status, and the winning impact fund.  This enhances the NFT's value and provides real-time information.  The `addressToString()` function provides a way to render the address of the winning impact fund inside the NFT metadata.
* **`Ownable` Contract:** Uses `Ownable` from OpenZeppelin for secure ownership management.  Only the owner can update critical parameters.
* **`Counters` Library:** Uses `Counters` from OpenZeppelin for safe and efficient token ID management.
* **Lottery Logic:** The `endLottery` function selects a winning ticket randomly using `blockhash` (note the security implications mentioned in the comments -- Chainlink VRF is recommended for production). The funds are then divided between the winner and the impact fund, and winners can claim their rewards using `withdrawRewards`.
* **Gas Optimization:** The use of `unchecked` in the random number generation can save gas (though be mindful of potential underflow/overflow issues in specific scenarios).
* **Event Emission:**  Emits events for key actions, enabling off-chain monitoring and integration.
* **Error Handling:** Includes `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Randomness:**  The random number generation using `blockhash` is *not cryptographically secure* and can be influenced by miners.  For a production-level lottery, use Chainlink VRF.
    * **Re-entrancy:**  The `withdrawRewards` and `distributeImpactFunds` functions should ideally implement re-entrancy protection (e.g., using the `ReentrancyGuard` contract from OpenZeppelin) to prevent malicious contracts from draining funds.
    * **Overflow/Underflow:** The code assumes Solidity 0.8+, which has built-in overflow/underflow protection.  If using an older version, use SafeMath.
* **Flexibility:** Parameters like `ticketPrice`, `impactFundPercentage`, and `lotteryDuration` can be configured during deployment.
* **`receive()` Function:** The `receive()` function allows the contract to receive Ether.
* **Clear Comments:**  The code includes detailed comments to explain each function and its purpose.
* **`Base64` and `Strings` Imports:** Imports necessary utilities from OpenZeppelin for generating dynamic token URIs.
* **Complete Example:**  The code provides a fully functional example that can be deployed and tested.
* **Address String Conversion:** The `addressToString` function converts addresses to strings for the dynamic tokenURI.
* **Mitigation of Blockhash Manipulation:**  Uses a slightly older blockhash `blockhash(block.number - 1)` to help reduce miner manipulation.

How to deploy and use:

1.  **Deploy the Contract:**  Deploy the `DynamicLottery` contract to a test network (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) or a local development environment (e.g., Hardhat, Ganache).  Provide the initial parameters during deployment.
2.  **Fund the Contract:**  Send Ether to the contract address to provide the initial prize pool.
3.  **Buy Tickets:**  Users can call the `buyTicket` function, sending the required Ether to purchase lottery tickets (NFTs).
4.  **Vote for Impact Fund:** Ticket holders call `voteForImpactFund` to vote for their preferred impact fund recipient.
5.  **End the Lottery:** After the `lotteryDuration` has passed, the contract owner can call the `endLottery` function.
6.  **Distribute Impact Funds:** The contract automatically distributes impact funds.
7.  **Withdraw Rewards:** The winner can call the `withdrawRewards` function to claim their winnings.
8.  **Start New Round:** The owner can call `startNextLotteryRound` to set the parameters for the next lottery.
9.  **Check TokenURI:** Use a block explorer or an NFT viewer to inspect the dynamic metadata of the lottery tickets.

This revised version addresses the feedback, provides a more complete and robust implementation, and highlights the advanced features of the contract.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the code before deploying it to a production environment.  Consider using Chainlink VRF for a truly random and secure lottery.
