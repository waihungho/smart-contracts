Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that goes beyond typical patterns, incorporating advanced ideas like probabilistic outcomes, future state commitments, dynamic state interactions (like "entanglement"), conditional logic based on future events or states, and internal reputation/alignment scores.

We'll call it `QuantumVault`. The idea is that users deposit funds, and their interaction with the vault and other users influences their "Alignment Score" and unlocks different capabilities or potential rewards, often based on non-deterministic or future-dependent factors.

**Core Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Probabilistic Outcomes:** Using on-chain (pseudo)randomness to influence function results (with caveats about security).
2.  **Future State Committing:** Users commit to an expected future state or outcome, verifiable later.
3.  **Dynamic Inter-User State (Entanglement):** Users can link their accounts/deposits in ways that affect each other's state within the contract.
4.  **Conditional Logic Based on Abstract States/Time:** Functions unlocked or modified based on "Alignment Score," contract "Phase," or specific future block numbers/timestamps AND other conditions.
5.  **Internal Resource/Potential Harvesting:** Users can "harvest" a small amount of value or influence based on their internal state and potentially contract-wide state.
6.  **State Mirroring (Limited):** One user can temporarily allow another to "mirror" certain aspects of their state (like alignment) for a specific, limited interaction.
7.  **Self-Correction/Guardian System:** Mechanisms for emergency intervention if internal invariants are broken.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumVault`

**Concept:** A vault managing Ether deposits where user interactions, future commitments, probabilistic events, and mutual "entanglement" influence user "Alignment Scores" and unlock unique functionalities. The contract operates in distinct "Phases" which alter rules.

**State Variables:**

*   `admin`: Contract owner.
*   `guardian`: Designated emergency address.
*   `totalDepositedAmount`: Sum of all user deposits.
*   `vaultPhase`: Enum representing the current operational phase.
*   `entropySeed`: Seed for pseudo-randomness (should be updated externally or via a secure VRF in production).
*   `userStates`: Mapping from address to `UserState` struct.
*   `entanglements`: Mapping tracking pairwise entanglement.
*   `conditionalWithdrawals`: Mapping tracking scheduled withdrawals.
*   `futureCommitments`: Mapping tracking user future state commitments.
*   `temporalLocks`: Mapping tracking time/condition based locks.
*   `delegatedAccess`: Mapping tracking conditional delegations.
*   `stateSnapshots`: Mapping from snapshot ID to `Snapshot` struct.
*   `selfCorrectionTriggered`: Flag indicating emergency state.

**Structs:**

*   `UserState`: amount deposited, alignmentScore, lastFluctuationBlock, etc.
*   `ConditionalWithdrawal`: recipient, amount, targetBlock, conditionMet.
*   `FutureStateCommitment`: committedBlock, expectedValueHash, fulfilled, claimed.
*   `TemporalLock`: lockedAmount, unlockBlock, conditionIdToBreakEarly, penaltyRate.
*   `DelegatedAccess`: delegator, scopeIdentifier, conditionId.
*   `Snapshot`: blockNumber, userStates (nested mapping).

**Enums:**

*   `VaultPhase`: e.g., Initializing, Open, Fluctuating, Stabilizing, Restricted.
*   `UnlockCondition`: e.g., SpecificBlockReached, AlignmentScoreAbove, ExternalConditionMet (simulated).
*   `DelegationScope`: e.g., HarvestPotential, AttemptUnlock.

**Events:**

*   `DepositReceived`
*   `WithdrawalProcessed`
*   `ProbabilisticOutcome`
*   `UsersEntangled`
*   `UsersDisentangled`
*   `AlignmentScoreUpdated`
*   `FutureStateCommitted`
*   `FutureStateClaimed`
*   `PhaseTransition`
*   `TemporalLockSet`
*   `ConditionalUnlockAttempted`
*   `AccessDelegated`
*   `InternalTransferProcessed`
*   `PotentialHarvested`
*   `SelfCorrectionInitiated`
*   `StateSnapshotCreated`
*   `SnapshotRewardClaimed`
*   `EntropySeedUpdated`

**Functions:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes admin, guardian, and initial phase/seed.
2.  `deposit()`: Standard payable deposit, updates user state and total balance.
3.  `withdraw(uint256 amount)`: Standard withdrawal, restricted based on locks, phase, etc.
4.  `scheduleConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 amount, uint256 targetBlock, UnlockCondition condition)`: Schedule a withdrawal only claimable after a block AND if a condition is met.
5.  `claimScheduledWithdrawal(uint256 withdrawalId)`: Attempt to claim a scheduled withdrawal if conditions are met.
6.  `tryProbabilisticWithdrawal(uint256 amount)`: Attempt to withdraw an amount with a chance of getting a bonus or penalty based on pseudo-randomness and alignment.
7.  `entangleDeposit(address partner)`: Links caller's deposit state with `partner`, affecting both alignment scores over time or during fluctuations.
8.  `disentangleDeposit(address partner)`: Breaks an existing entanglement.
9.  `commitFutureState(bytes32 expectedValueHash, uint256 verificationBlock)`: User commits to what a hash of data will be at a specific future block.
10. `verifyAndClaimFutureState(bytes32 actualValue, uint256 commitmentId)`: Verify if the committed future state matches the actual value at the block and potentially claim a reward or alignment boost.
11. `triggerQuantumFluctuation()`: (Admin/Guardian only) Triggers a contract-wide event that applies probabilistic changes or alignment score adjustments to entangled users.
12. `setTemporalConditionalLock(uint256 amount, uint256 unlockBlock, UnlockCondition conditionIdToBreakEarly)`: Locks a specific amount until `unlockBlock` UNLESS `conditionIdToBreakEarly` is met before then.
13. `attemptConditionalUnlock(uint256 lockId)`: Attempts to unlock a temporal lock early by checking its condition.
14. `delegateConditionalAccess(address delegatee, DelegationScope scope, uint256 conditionId)`: Delegates the *ability* to perform a specific action (like `attemptConditionalUnlock` or `harvestPotential`) *if* a condition is met, without giving full control.
15. `revokeConditionalAccessDelegation(address delegatee, DelegationScope scope)`: Revokes a specific delegation.
16. `transitionPhase(VaultPhase newPhase)`: (Admin only) Changes the contract's operational phase, altering rules/availabilities of functions.
17. `transferInternal(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfer an amount *between* users *within* the vault (doesn't leave the contract), potentially affecting alignment or entanglement.
18. `harvestPotential()`: Allows users with a high enough alignment score during certain phases to claim a small bonus drawn from contract-wide "potential" (e.g., accumulated penalties or a small inflation factor).
19. `exitTemporalLockEarly(uint256 lockId)`: Allows exiting a temporal lock before its time/condition, but incurs a penalty.
20. `triggerSelfCorrection()`: (Admin/Guardian only) Initiates an emergency state, potentially freezing actions or running a balance reconciliation check if internal invariants are broken.
21. `mirrorStateForAction(address targetUser, DelegationScope scope, bytes calldata actionData)`: Allows caller to attempt an action (`scope`) as if they *had* the `targetUser`'s state (e.g., alignment score) for that single transaction, if the target user has allowed this kind of mirroring (implied permission or pre-approved). Requires complex internal state checking.
22. `createStateSnapshot()`: (Admin only) Records the `UserState` of all active users at the current block number for future reference or reward distribution.
23. `claimSnapshotReward(uint256 snapshotId)`: Allows users to claim a reward based on their state (e.g., alignment) at a specific past snapshot, if a reward pool for that snapshot exists (simplified here).
24. `setGuardian(address newGuardian)`: (Admin only) Sets the emergency guardian address.
25. `guardianTriggerSelfCorrection()`: (Guardian only) Allows the guardian to trigger self-correction.

**View Functions:**

26. `getUserState(address user)`: Get details of a user's state.
27. `getEntanglementStatus(address user1, address user2)`: Check if two users are entangled.
28. `getTemporalLockDetails(address user, uint256 lockId)`: Get details of a specific lock.
29. `getFutureCommitmentDetails(address user, uint256 commitmentId)`: Get details of a specific commitment.
30. `getCurrentPhase()`: Get the current vault phase.

33. `getAdmin()`: Get the admin address.
34. `getGuardian()`: Get the guardian address.
35. `getEntropySeed()`: Get the current entropy seed (caution: security risk if used directly for high-value outcomes).
36. `getConditionalWithdrawalDetails(address user, uint256 withdrawalId)`: Get details of a scheduled withdrawal.
37. `getDelegatedAccess(address delegator, address delegatee, DelegationScope scope)`: Check if a specific delegation exists.
