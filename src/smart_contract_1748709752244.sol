Okay, let's create a smart contract that embodies several advanced concepts, going beyond standard token or NFT contracts. We'll build a decentralized, actively managed investment fund with dynamic strategies ("Quantum States"), tiered participation, internal performance tracking, and integration potential for various asset types.

This contract, which we'll call `QuantumFund`, will simulate managing a portfolio of ETH, approved ERC20 tokens, and even approved ERC721 NFTs. Its "quantum" aspect comes from having different operational "modes" or "states" that affect investment strategy, risk profile, and profit distribution dynamically.

### QuantumFund Smart Contract: Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `QuantumFund`

**Description:** A decentralized investment fund managing a portfolio of ETH, approved ERC20 tokens, and approved ERC721 NFTs. The fund operates based on dynamic "Quantum States" that influence investment strategy, asset allocation, and profit distribution mechanisms. Investors can deposit assets and claim profits based on their share and the fund's performance under different states.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Portfolio:** Manages ETH, ERC20s, and ERC721s.
2.  **Quantum States:** Distinct operational modes (`STABLE`, `GROWTH`, `QUANTUM_FLUX`, etc.) affecting fund logic.
3.  **Tiered Participation:** Investors might gain different benefits based on their investment size or time. (Implemented a basic tier based on initial deposit value for bonus distribution).
4.  **Simulated Oracle/Valuation:** Uses internally updated price feeds for asset valuation (to avoid external oracle dependency complexity *within this example*, assumes a trusted manager updates).
5.  **Performance Tracking:** Tracks historical performance across different states.
6.  **Dynamic Profit Distribution:** Profit sharing can vary based on the current Quantum State.
7.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Manager and potentially other roles for specific actions.

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Store fund manager, approved assets, investor balances, asset holdings, current state, performance data, simulated prices, etc.
2.  **Enums & Structs:** Define Quantum States, Investor Tiers, Performance tracking structures.
3.  **Events:** Log key actions (Deposits, Withdrawals, State Changes, Asset Trades, Profit Distribution).
4.  **Modifiers:** Access control (`onlyManager`, `onlyApprovedToken`, etc.).
5.  **Constructor:** Initialize fund manager.
6.  **Configuration & Management Functions (by Manager):** Add/Remove assets, update simulated prices, change state, set fees.
7.  **Investor Functions:** Deposit assets (ETH, ERC20), withdraw shares, claim profits.
8.  **Fund Operation Functions (by Manager/DAO):** Buy/Sell assets (ERC20, ERC721), rebalance portfolio.
9.  **Calculation & Distribution Functions:** Calculate AUM, calculate profits, distribute profits.
10. **Query & View Functions:** Get status, balances, holdings, performance data, approved assets.
11. **Emergency Functions:** Pause/Unpause, emergency withdrawal.

**Function Summary (>= 20 functions):**

1.  `constructor(address initialManager)`: Deploys the contract, sets initial manager.
2.  `setManager(address newManager)`: Changes the fund manager (only current manager).
3.  `addApprovedToken(address tokenAddress)`: Adds an ERC20 token to the list of approved assets (only manager).
4.  `removeApprovedToken(address tokenAddress)`: Removes an ERC20 token (only manager).
5.  `addApprovedNFTCollection(address collectionAddress)`: Adds an ERC721 collection (only manager).
6.  `removeApprovedNFTCollection(address collectionAddress)`: Removes an ERC721 collection (only manager).
7.  `updateSimulatedTokenPrice(address tokenAddress, uint256 priceInWei)`: Updates the simulated price for an approved token (only manager).
8.  `updateSimulatedNFTCollectionFloorPrice(address collectionAddress, uint256 priceInWei)`: Updates the simulated floor price for an approved NFT collection (only manager).
9.  `changeQuantumState(QuantumState newState)`: Changes the fund's operational state (only manager).
10. `depositETH()`: Allows investors to deposit ETH into the fund.
11. `depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows investors to deposit approved ERC20 tokens.
12. `buyToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amountInWei, uint256 minTokensReceived)`: Buys approved ERC20 tokens using fund ETH/assets (only manager). Requires simulated price or integrated swap logic (simplified here by assuming manager executes external swap and updates state).
13. `sellToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amountTokens, uint256 minEthReceived)`: Sells approved ERC20 tokens for ETH (only manager). Simplified similarly to `buyToken`.
14. `buyNFT(address collectionAddress, uint256 tokenId, uint256 priceInWei)`: Buys an approved NFT using fund ETH (only manager). Requires NFT transfer post-purchase.
15. `sellNFT(address collectionAddress, uint256 tokenId, uint256 minPriceInWei)`: Sells an owned NFT for ETH (only manager). Requires NFT transfer pre-sale.
16. `rebalancePortfolio()`: Trigger rebalancing logic based on current Quantum State (only manager). (Internal logic is complex, function acts as a trigger).
17. `calculateCurrentAUM()`: Calculates the fund's total value across all assets based on simulated prices (view function).
18. `calculateInvestorProfit(address investor)`: Calculates an investor's share of unrealized profit (view function).
19. `distributeProfits()`: Distributes accumulated profits to eligible investors based on their share and current state rules (only manager). Resets profit calculation cycle.
20. `claimProfits()`: Allows an investor to claim their distributed profits.
21. `getInvestorBalance(address investor)`: Gets an investor's total deposited value (view).
22. `getFundEthBalance()`: Gets the contract's ETH balance (view).
23. `getFundTokenBalance(address tokenAddress)`: Gets the contract's balance of a specific ERC20 token (view).
24. `getFundNFTOwnership(address collectionAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Checks if the fund owns a specific NFT (view).
25. `getCurrentQuantumState()`: Gets the current operational state (view).
26. `getApprovedTokens()`: Lists all approved ERC20 tokens (view).
27. `getApprovedNFTCollections()`: Lists all approved ERC721 collections (view).
28. `getPerformanceMetrics()`: Returns struct containing key performance indicators (view).
29. `getInvestorTier(address investor)`: Gets the calculated tier of an investor (view).
30. `pauseFund()`: Pauses core operations (deposits, withdrawals, trades, distributions) (only manager).
31. `unpauseFund()`: Unpauses operations (only manager).
32. `emergencyWithdrawEth(uint256 amount)`: Allows manager to withdraw ETH in emergency (only manager).
33. `emergencyWithdrawToken(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows manager to withdraw approved tokens in emergency (only manager).
34. `emergencyWithdrawNFT(address collectionAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Allows manager to withdraw an owned NFT in emergency (only manager).

*(Note: Function 12-15, the asset buying/selling, are highly simplified. A real fund would interact with DEXs or marketplaces, which adds significant complexity with interfaces, swap pathing, etc. Here, they mainly update internal state and assume the manager handles the external execution and subsequent transfers/receives.)*

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Portfolio (ETH, ERC20, ERC721):** Managing different asset types within a single fund contract is more complex than single-token funds. It requires handling native ETH, standard fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens, each with distinct interaction patterns (sending ETH, `transfer`/`transferFrom` for ERC20, `safeTransferFrom` for ERC721, tracking ownership explicitly).
2.  **Quantum States (Dynamic Strategy):** The `QuantumState` enum and the `changeQuantumState` function introduce a mechanism for the fund's operational logic to change based on a state variable. While the *implementation* of state-specific rebalancing and distribution is simplified, the *architecture* allows for complex, potentially external (via manager calls), strategies to be dictated by the current state. This is a creative way to represent different investment profiles or market views within the contract's lifecycle.
3.  **Tiered Participation & Dynamic Profit Distribution:** The `InvestorTier` enum and `getInvestorTier` function (based on initial deposit value) combined with the profit calculation (`calculateInvestorProfit`) showing an example of a tier-based bonus add a layer of dynamic incentives for investors. Profit distribution using the `cumulativeProfitPerShare` pattern is a standard but effective way to handle continuous profit accrual and allow investors to claim at any time without gas-intensive iteration over all participants during distribution. The `profitDistributionPercentagePerState` mapping adds a state-dependent variable to the profit mechanism.
4.  **Simulated Oracle/Valuation:** Instead of relying on external, gas-costly Oracle calls within core logic, the contract uses manager-updatable `simulatedTokenPrices` and `simulatedNFTCollectionFloorPrices`. While less decentralized and requiring trust in the manager, this approach is necessary *for this example* to achieve complex internal AUM calculation (`calculateCurrentAUM`) and profit calculation without adding the boilerplate of specific Oracle integrations (like Chainlink, which is widely available open source, thus violating the "don't duplicate" rule). This allows the contract to *reason about the value* of its diverse assets internally.
5.  **Internal Performance Tracking:** The `PerformanceMetrics` struct and `historicalPerformanceSnapshots` array allow the contract to record its own performance over time, tied to specific states or events (`snapshotPerformance` is called on state change or distribution). This provides a built-in, verifiable history of the fund's health and the impact of different "Quantum States."
6.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Standard `onlyManager` modifier is used, but the architecture implies that the manager could be a multi-sig or even a DAO for greater decentralization, elevating it beyond a simple single-owner contract.
7.  **ReentrancyGuard:** Included the OpenZeppelin `ReentrancyGuard` for safety on state-changing functions that interact with external addresses (like sending ETH or tokens).
8.  **Clear Separation of Concerns (Simulated):** Functions are grouped by purpose (Management, Investor, Operations, Calculation, Query, Emergency). Although asset buying/selling is simplified, the structure is laid out for integration with external DEX/marketplace logic.

This contract combines elements of fund management, asset valuation (simulated), strategic state changes, and tiered investor mechanics into a single system, aiming for complexity and showcasing how different common building blocks can be combined in novel ways beyond typical examples. It has significantly more than the requested 20 functions.
