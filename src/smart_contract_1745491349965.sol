Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and trendy concepts, featuring well over the requested 20 functions.

This contract represents a "Quantum Fund" â€“ a decentralized, committee-managed investment pool designed to dynamically allocate staked Ether (WETH) across various approved external "strategies" (simulated via interfaces) based on committee proposals and votes. It includes features like share-based ownership, performance fees, time-locked strategy access, proposal-based governance, and access control.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is a complex example for demonstration purposes. It contains concepts that would require significant testing, security audits, and careful consideration of gas costs and external protocol interactions for production use. It simulates external strategy interactions via an interface rather than integrating with real protocols.

**Explanation of Concepts & Features:**

1.  **Wrapped Ether (WETH):** Standard practice in DeFi to handle Ether as an ERC-20 token, allowing interaction with ERC-20 based strategies and swaps.
2.  **Share-Based Ownership:** Users don't own a specific amount of WETH directly, but rather shares in the total value of the fund. The value of each share changes as the fund's total assets grow or shrink (due to strategy yield, fees, or market fluctuations). This is common in investment pools/vaults.
3.  **Dynamic Multi-Strategy Allocation:** The fund doesn't stick to one strategy. It can hold funds directly (`WETH.balanceOf`) and invest in multiple external strategies via a generic `IStrategy` interface.
4.  **Committee Governance:** Key decisions (adding/removing strategies, changing allocations, managing committee members) are controlled by a multi-member committee, rather than a single owner.
5.  **Proposal System:** Changes are initiated via proposals that go through a structured process: Creation -> Voting -> Execution. This is a simplified DAO-like pattern.
6.  **Voting Mechanics:** Committee members vote Yes/No/Abstain. Proposal success depends on reaching a Quorum (minimum participation) and an Approval Threshold (percentage of Yes votes).
7.  **Execution Grace Period:** A window after voting ends where a successful proposal can be executed by anyone (to ensure decentralization of execution).
8.  **Target Allocation & Rebalancing:** The committee sets target percentages for each strategy. A `rebalanceAllocations` function attempts to move funds to match these targets, optimizing yield distribution across strategies.
9.  **Time-Locked Strategies:** Strategies can be configured with a `lockUntil` timestamp, preventing funds from being withdrawn or reallocated from them before the lock expires. This simulates common DeFi staking/locking periods.
10. **Performance Fees:** The fund takes a percentage of the *increase* in the fund's total value since the last fee collection, distributed to a fee recipient. This incentivizes good management.
11. **Access Control (Manager/Committee):** Distinct roles with different permissions. Manager has high-level control (pausing, parameter setting, emergency withdrawals), while the Committee controls core investment strategy via proposals.
12. **Pause Mechanism:** An emergency function allowing managers to halt critical operations (deposit, withdraw, rebalance) if there's an issue (e.g., a bug found in a strategy).
13. **Emergency Withdrawal:** A manager-only function to rescue *liquid* funds from the contract in dire situations, bypassing normal withdrawal/governance.
14. **Parameterization:** Key fund and governance parameters (voting periods, thresholds, fees, minimum deposit) are configurable by the manager.
15. **Iterating Active Strategies:** Maintaining an array (`activeStrategyIds`) alongside a mapping makes iterating through strategies more gas-efficient than iterating through mapping keys (which isn't directly possible).
16. **Separate Concerns:** While within one contract, the logic separates core fund mechanics, governance flows, and strategy interactions (via interface).
17. **Error Handling:** Using `require` for preconditions and including basic `try/catch` simulation for external calls in `rebalanceAllocations` (though robust error handling for external calls is much more complex).
18. **Getters:** Numerous public/external view functions to inspect the state of the contract, fund value, share value, proposal details, etc.
19. **Dynamic Committee:** The committee membership can change via governance proposals.
20. **Manual Strategy Interaction:** `enterStrategy` and `exitStrategy` allow managers to directly move funds to/from strategies outside a full rebalance, potentially for specific scenarios or onboarding/offboarding strategies.

This contract provides a solid framework for a dynamic, community-managed investment fund, incorporating several advanced patterns beyond a simple ERC-20 or vault. It exceeds the 20-function requirement and demonstrates creative use of Solidity features for on-chain finance and governance.
