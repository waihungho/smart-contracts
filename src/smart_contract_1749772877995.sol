Okay, let's design a smart contract for a **Decentralized Autonomous Research Guild (DARG)**. This contract will manage a community focused on funding, conducting, and validating research in a decentralized manner.

It incorporates concepts like:
*   **Decentralized Project Funding:** Members can propose and fund research projects.
*   **Milestone-Based Funding Release:** Funds for projects are released based on verified milestones.
*   **Decentralized Contribution & Validation:** Researchers can submit findings, and members/validators can rate and validate them.
*   **Reputation System:** Members earn reputation based on positive contributions, funding, and validation.
*   **Reputation-Weighted Governance:** Voting power in the DAO is weighted by member reputation.
*   **Tiered Validation:** Both general members and elected/appointed validators participate in assessing contributions.

This design avoids directly duplicating standard token, NFT, or generic DAO contracts by focusing specifically on the research lifecycle and integrating reputation deeply into funding, validation, and governance.

**Smart Contract: Decentralized Autonomous Research Guild (DARG)**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Define core data structures and contract state.
    *   Guild parameters (joining stake, voting periods, etc.)
    *   Mappings for members, projects, contributions, governance proposals.
    *   Counters for unique IDs.
    *   Treasury balance.
    *   Governor address (initially owner, becomes governable).
2.  **Enums:** Define states for projects, contributions, and proposals.
3.  **Structs:** Define data structures for `Member`, `ResearchProject`, `Milestone`, `Contribution`, `GovernanceProposal`.
4.  **Events:** Declare events for key actions.
5.  **Modifiers:** Define access control modifiers (`onlyMember`, `onlyValidator`, `onlyProposer`, `onlyGovernor`).
6.  **Constructor:** Initialize core parameters and the initial governor.
7.  **Member Management:** Functions for joining, leaving, and querying member status/reputation.
8.  **Research Project Management:** Functions for proposing, funding, querying, and managing project status and milestones.
9.  **Contribution Management:** Functions for submitting research findings and querying them.
10. **Validation and Rating:** Functions for members/validators to rate and validate contributions. Logic for reputation calculation.
11. **Funding Release:** Functions for project proposers to request funding release based on milestones and for validators/governance to approve.
12. **Treasury and Rewards:** Functions to manage the treasury and potentially distribute rewards based on validated contributions.
13. **Governance:** Standard DAO functions for proposing, voting on, and executing contract upgrades or parameter changes, potentially including validator appointments.
14. **Utility/View Functions:** Helper functions to query contract state.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor()`: Initializes the guild with basic parameters and sets the initial governor.
*   `joinGuild()`: Allows an address to become a member by paying a joining stake.
*   `leaveGuild()`: Allows a member to leave, potentially withdrawing stake based on reputation.
*   `isMember(address account)`: Checks if an address is a member. (View)
*   `getMemberInfo(address account)`: Retrieves a member's detailed information. (View)
*   `getMemberReputation(address account)`: Retrieves a member's current reputation score. (View)
*   `proposeResearchProject(string memory title, string memory description, uint256 fundingGoal, string[] memory milestoneDescriptions)`: Allows a member to propose a new research project with milestones.
*   `fundResearchProject(uint256 projectId)`: Allows anyone to contribute ETH to a project's funding goal.
*   `getProjectDetails(uint256 projectId)`: Retrieves details of a specific research project. (View)
*   `listProjectsByStatus(ProjectStatus status)`: Lists project IDs filtered by their status. (View)
*   `submitResearchContribution(uint256 projectId, string memory title, string memory uri)`: Allows a project proposer or authorized researcher to submit a research contribution for a project milestone.
*   `getContributionDetails(uint256 contributionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific contribution. (View)
*   `listContributionsForProject(uint256 projectId)`: Lists contribution IDs associated with a project. (View)
*   `rateContribution(uint256 contributionId, uint8 rating)`: Allows any member to rate a submitted contribution (e.g., 1-5 stars).
*   `validateContribution(uint256 contributionId, bool isValid)`: Allows appointed validators to formally validate a contribution.
*   `getContributionAverageRating(uint256 contributionId)`: Calculates the average rating for a contribution. (View)
*   `requestFundingRelease(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: Allows a project proposer to request funding for a completed milestone.
*   `approveFundingRelease(uint256 projectId, uint256 milestoneIndex)`: Allows validators or governance to approve a requested funding release.
*   `proposeGovernanceAction(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory calldata, string memory description)`: Allows members (potentially based on reputation/stake) to propose a governance action (e.g., updating parameters, appointing validators).
*   `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Allows members to vote on an active proposal, weighted by their reputation.
*   `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal.
*   `getGovernanceProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a governance proposal. (View)
*   `listGovernanceProposalsByState(ProposalState state)`: Lists proposal IDs filtered by state. (View)
*   `appointValidator(address account)`: Governance action to appoint a member as a validator.
*   `removeValidator(address account)`: Governance action to remove a validator.
*   `isValidator(address account)`: Checks if an address is an appointed validator. (View)
*   `getTreasuryBalance()`: Gets the current balance of the guild's treasury. (View)
*   `distributeResearchRewards(uint256 contributionId)`: (Optional/Advanced) Function to distribute rewards from the treasury for a highly rated/validated contribution.
