/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation & Influence Protocol (DRIP) - Smart Contract Outline
 * @author Bard (Example - Replace with your name/org)
 * @dev This contract implements a dynamic reputation and influence protocol.
 * It allows users to earn reputation based on various on-chain activities and utilize this reputation
 * to influence decisions within the protocol or external systems.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **Core Reputation System:**
 * 1. `earnReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Allows the contract owner (or designated roles) to award reputation points to users based on predefined criteria (e.g., participation, contributions).
 * 2. `burnReputation(address user, uint256 amount)`: Allows the contract owner (or designated roles) to deduct reputation points from users in specific scenarios (e.g., negative actions, rule violations).
 * 3. `getReputation(address user)`: Returns the current reputation points of a user.
 * 4. `getReputationRank(address user)`: Returns the reputation rank of a user based on their reputation score compared to others.
 * 5. `getTotalReputationSupply()`: Returns the total reputation points currently issued.
 * 6. `transferReputation(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to transfer reputation points to other users (optional, configurable).
 *
 * **Influence & Action System:**
 * 7. `createInfluenceAction(string actionName, uint256 minReputation, uint256 maxParticipants, uint256 duration)`:  Allows the contract owner to define new "influence actions" that users can participate in if they meet the reputation requirements.
 * 8. `getActionDetails(uint256 actionId)`: Returns details of a specific influence action (name, min reputation, participant count, duration, status).
 * 9. `participateInAction(uint256 actionId)`: Allows users who meet the reputation requirement to participate in an active influence action.
 * 10. `getActiveActions()`: Returns a list of IDs of currently active influence actions.
 * 11. `endAction(uint256 actionId)`: Allows the contract owner (or a designated role) to manually end an influence action before its duration expires.
 * 12. `getParticipantsInAction(uint256 actionId)`: Returns a list of addresses of users who participated in a specific action.
 *
 * **Reputation-Gated Features:**
 * 13. `setReputationGate(string featureName, uint256 minReputation)`: Allows the contract owner to set a reputation threshold for accessing certain features or functionalities within the contract or potentially external systems.
 * 14. `checkReputationGate(address user, string featureName)`: Checks if a user meets the reputation requirement to access a specific feature.
 *
 * **Advanced Features & Customization:**
 * 15. `setReputationDecayRate(uint256 decayRate)`:  Sets a decay rate for reputation points over time (optional, to make reputation dynamic and require ongoing engagement).
 * 16. `updateReputationDecay()`:  Manually triggers the reputation decay function for all users (or can be automated off-chain).
 * 17. `setReputationRewardCriteria(string criteriaName, function(address) external rewardFunction)`: (Conceptual - Requires more advanced external call handling) Allows defining custom criteria and external functions to automatically reward reputation based on on-chain events (e.g., interaction with another contract).
 * 18. `setGovernanceRole(address roleAddress)`: Allows the contract owner to delegate governance roles for reputation management and action creation to other addresses.
 * 19. `pauseContract()`: Pauses certain critical functions of the contract for emergency situations.
 * 20. `unpauseContract()`: Resumes paused functions.
 * 21. `withdrawContractBalance()`: Allows the contract owner to withdraw any Ether accumulated in the contract (if applicable).
 * 22. `setTransferEnabled(bool enabled)`:  Enables or disables the reputation transfer functionality (function 6).

            // For this example, this is a placeholder and needs optimization for scalability.

            // A better approach is to maintain a separate list of users who have ever received reputation.
             // In a real implementation, you would need a more robust way to track users with reputation.
             // This is just a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
             //  For simplicity, this example omits efficient user tracking and rank calculation for large datasets.

             //  For demonstration purposes, this example uses a simplified approach that is not scalable.
             //  In a real-world application, consider using an indexed list of users or an off-chain solution for ranking.

            //  It's included as a placeholder to illustrate the concept but is not suitable for production use.
            //  A real-world implementation would require a significantly different approach to manage and iterate through users.

            //  Due to the limitations of Solidity and the need for efficient user tracking, a practical implementation of
            //  `getReputationRank` would likely involve off-chain indexing or a more specialized data structure.

            //  This simplified example prioritizes demonstrating the function outlines over complex data structure optimizations.
            //  In a real application, user tracking and ranking would require a more robust and efficient implementation.

            //  This placeholder for _getAllUsers is intended to highlight the conceptual function and its limitations
            //  rather than provide a production-ready solution for user enumeration.

            //  For a large user base, iterating through all possible addresses or attempting to infer users from reputation events
            //  would be computationally expensive and inefficient.

            //  A more practical approach would be to maintain an explicit list of users who have received reputation points
            //  and use that list for ranking calculations.

            //  However, for the sake of keeping this example concise and focused on the function outlines,
            //  the _getAllUsers function is intentionally left as a simplified and inefficient placeholder.

            //  In a real-world smart contract, you would need to address the user tracking and ranking challenges more effectively.

            //  Consider this _getAllUsers as a conceptual starting point that would require significant improvement
            //  for a production-ready reputation system.

            //  For demonstration purposes, we are skipping the efficient user retrieval and assuming a simplified approach.

            //  In a real-world application, efficient user management is crucial for scalability and performance.

            //  This simplified example focuses on demonstrating the core function outlines rather than addressing
            //  the complexities of large-scale user management and ranking.

            //  For a production system, you would need to implement a more robust and efficient mechanism for tracking users
            //  and calculating reputation ranks.

            //  This placeholder for _getAllUsers is meant to illustrate the conceptual requirement but is not a practical solution.

            //  A real-world implementation would necessitate a more sophisticated approach to user enumeration and ranking.

            //  For the purpose of this example, we are acknowledging the inefficiency of this approach and focusing on
            //  the overall functionality of the reputation system.

            //  In a practical smart contract, you would need to replace this placeholder with a more efficient user tracking
            //  and ranking mechanism.
