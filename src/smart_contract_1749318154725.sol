Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract that implements a "TimeStream Escrow" system. It allows creating streams of ERC-20 tokens that are released linearly over time, similar to vesting or streaming payments.

It includes advanced features like:
1.  **Multi-Party Lifecycle Management:** Pausing, resuming, and cancelling streams require a request from one party and confirmation from the other (sender/recipient).
2.  **Recipient Change:** Allows changing the recipient of a stream mid-flow, requiring multi-party consent (sender, current recipient, new recipient).
3.  **Conditional Acceleration:** A designated `CONTROLLER_ROLE` can accelerate the stream release by making future amounts available earlier, based on off-chain conditions (represented here by calling a function, but imagine it triggered by an oracle).
4.  **Deposits:** Allows topping up existing streams.
5.  **Withdrawal Fees:** Configurable fee on withdrawals.
6.  **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for admin tasks, controllers, and fee recipients.
7.  **Emergency Pause:** Admin can pause all streams.

It aims for complexity and avoids directly copying a single standard template like OpenZeppelin's VestingWallet or Sablier's basic stream contract by integrating these combined features.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

*   **Contract Name:** `TimeStreamEscrow`
*   **Purpose:** Manages linear release of ERC-20 tokens over time with advanced lifecycle controls, conditional acceleration, and recipient changes.
*   **Core Data:** `Stream` struct storing stream details (sender, recipient, token, amounts, timings, pause state, request/confirm states).
*   **Roles:**
    *   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Manages roles, fees, emergency pause.
    *   `CONTROLLER_ROLE`: Can trigger conditional acceleration or add bonuses.
    *   `FEE_RECIPIENT_ROLE`: Address to receive withdrawal fees.
*   **Key Functions (>= 20):**

    1.  **Creation:**
        *   `createStream`: Creates a new time-based stream.
    2.  **Stream Lifecycle (Request/Confirm/Reject):**
        *   `requestPause`: Initiates pausing a stream.
        *   `confirmPause`: Confirms a requested pause.
        *   `rejectPause`: Rejects a requested pause.
        *   `requestResume`: Initiates resuming a paused stream.
        *   `confirmResume`: Confirms a requested resume.
        *   `rejectResume`: Rejects a requested resume.
        *   `requestCancel`: Initiates cancelling a stream.
        *   `confirmCancel`: Confirms a requested cancel.
        *   `rejectCancel`: Rejects a requested cancel.
    3.  **Recipient Change (Request/Confirm/Reject):**
        *   `requestStreamRecipientChange`: Sender requests changing the stream recipient.
        *   `confirmRecipientChangeByCurrentRecipient`: Current recipient confirms the change.
        *   `confirmRecipientChangeByNewRecipient`: New recipient confirms the change.
        *   `rejectStreamRecipientChange`: Any party rejects the change.
    4.  **Fund Management:**
        *   `withdraw`: Allows recipient to withdraw available streamed funds.
        *   `depositToStream`: Allows depositing more funds into an existing stream.
        *   `releaseUpToTimeConditionally`: (CONTROLLER_ROLE) Makes funds up to a future time instantly available for withdrawal.
        *   `addBonusToStream`: (CONTROLLER_ROLE) Adds bonus funds to a stream, making them instantly available.
    5.  **Fee Management:**
        *   `setWithdrawalFee`: (ADMIN) Sets the withdrawal fee percentage.
        *   `withdrawFees`: (FEE_RECIPIENT_ROLE) Withdraws accumulated fees.
    6.  **Emergency Admin:**
        *   `emergencyPauseAllStreams`: (ADMIN) Pauses all streams globally.
        *   `emergencyResumeAllStreams`: (ADMIN) Resumes all globally paused streams.
    7.  **Information / Getters:**
        *   `getStream`: Retrieves details of a stream.
        *   `getWithdrawableAmount`: Calculates the amount currently available for withdrawal.
        *   `getStreamedAmount`: Calculates the amount that has been streamed up to a specific time.
        *   `isStreamPaused`: Checks if a stream is paused (individually or globally).
        *   `isStreamCancelled`: Checks if a stream is cancelled.
        *   `getStreamCountBySender`: Gets the number of streams created by a sender.
        *   `getStreamIdBySenderAndIndex`: Gets a stream ID by sender and index.
        *   `getStreamCountByRecipient`: Gets the number of streams for a recipient.
        *   `getStreamIdByRecipientAndIndex`: Gets a stream ID by recipient and index.
        *   `getTotalStreams`: Gets the total number of streams.
        *   `getStreamIdByIndex`: Gets a stream ID by global index.
        *   `getFeePercentage`: Gets the current withdrawal fee percentage.
        *   `getAccumulatedFees`: Gets the total accumulated fees for a token.
    8.  **Access Control (Inherited from OpenZeppelin):**
        *   `grantRole`
        *   `revokeRole`
        *   `hasRole`
        *   `getRoleAdmin`
        *   `renounceRole`
        *   ...and others.
