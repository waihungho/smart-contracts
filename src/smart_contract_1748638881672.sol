Okay, here is a smart contract in Solidity that attempts to incorporate several interesting and somewhat advanced/creative concepts around decentralized funding, weighted governance influenced by off-chain factors (simulated via an evaluation score), dynamic NFTs linked to participation and outcomes, and multi-asset handling. It aims to exceed the 20-function requirement while avoiding direct copies of major open-source protocols.

**Disclaimer:** This contract is complex and designed for demonstration purposes. It includes concepts that would require significant testing, security audits, and potentially more robust mechanisms (like upgradeability, detailed access control, and off-chain data verification) for production use. The NFT interactions assume a basic external contract interface.

/**
 * @title DecentralizedInnovationFund
 * @dev A decentralized fund allowing community members to propose, vote on, and fund innovative projects.
 * Features include multi-token contributions, weighted voting based on 'evaluation scores' and participation NFTs,
 * outcome reporting, and NFT rewards for successful project contributors/voters.
 */

/**
 * @title Outline & Function Summary
 *
 * This contract manages a community-driven fund. Users can deposit various allowed tokens,
 * submit proposals for projects, vote on these proposals with weighted influence, and receive
 * potential returns or NFTs based on project outcomes.
 *
 * State Variables:
 * - Mapping of allowed tokens and their status.
 * - Balances of each allowed token held by the contract.
 * - Balances of each allowed token contributed by users.
 * - Structs and mappings for managing proposals (status, votes, requested amount, deadlines, etc.).
 * - Mapping for user voting weight/evaluation scores.
 * - Mapping for reporting project outcomes and returned funds.
 * - Addresses of external NFT contracts for voter/curator roles and success badges.
 * - Parameters like voting quorum, approval threshold, minimum voting duration.
 *
 * Functions (>= 20):
 * 1. Fund Management:
 *    - addAllowedToken(address token): Owner adds a token that can be accepted by the fund.
 *    - removeAllowedToken(address token): Owner removes an allowed token.
 *    - deposit(address token, uint256 amount): Users deposit allowed tokens into the fund. (Includes payable for ETH).
 *    - withdraw(address token, uint256 amount): Users withdraw their available contribution.
 *    - getFundBalance(address token): View contract's balance for a specific token.
 *    - getUserContribution(address user, address token): View a user's total contribution for a token.
 *    - getTotalLockedFunds(address token): View total funds locked in approved/funded proposals for a token.
 *
 * 2. Proposal Management:
 *    - submitProposal(string calldata title, string calldata description, address token, uint256 amountRequested, address recipient, uint256 votingDuration): User submits a new project proposal.
 *    - cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId): Proposer can cancel their pending proposal.
 *    - getProposal(uint256 proposalId): View details of a specific proposal.
 *    - getProposalsByStatus(ProposalStatus status): View a list of proposal IDs filtered by status.
 *    - getTotalProposals(): View the total number of proposals ever submitted.
 *
 * 3. Voting & Evaluation:
 *    - setVoterNFTContract(address _nftContract): Owner sets the address of the Voter/Curator NFT contract.
 *    - setSuccessNFTContract(address _nftContract): Owner sets the address of the Success Contributor NFT contract.
 *    - setVotingWeight(address user, uint256 weight): Owner (or potentially governance) sets a user's voting weight/evaluation score.
 *    - getVotingWeight(address user): View a user's current voting weight.
 *    - vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support): Users cast a weighted vote on a proposal within the voting period.
 *    - finalizeVoting(uint256 proposalId): Anyone can call to check deadline, tally weighted votes, and update proposal status (Approved/Rejected).
 *    - getUserVote(uint256 proposalId, address user): View if and how a user voted on a proposal.
 *    - calculateVotingWeight(address user): Internal/View function to derive effective voting weight (can incorporate NFT checks or score).
 *
 * 4. Funding & Execution:
 *    - fundProposal(uint256 proposalId): Transfers the approved amount from the fund to the proposal recipient.
 *    - reportInvestmentOutcome(uint256 proposalId, InvestmentOutcomeStatus outcome, address tokenReturned, uint256 amountReturned): Proposer/Approved reporter submits the outcome of a funded project and any returns.
 *    - claimReturns(uint256 proposalId): Users can claim their proportional share of reported returns (if returns are distributed back to users, otherwise returns boost the fund pool). *Revised:* Returns boost the general fund pool. Users withdraw from their total balance. This function isn't needed with the simplified model. Let's add a different function.
 *    - distributeReturnsToFund(uint256 proposalId): Callable after outcome is reported successful with returns. Transfers reported returns into the main fund balance.
 *
 * 5. Rewards & Engagement:
 *    - issueVoterNFT(address recipient, uint256 tokenId): Owner/privileged issues a Voter/Curator NFT (calls external contract).
 *    - issueSuccessContributorNFT(uint256 proposalId, address recipient): Owner/privileged issues a Success Contributor NFT (calls external contract) for participants of a successful project.
 *
 * 6. Utility & Control:
 *    - pause(): Owner pauses the contract (stops sensitive operations).
 *    - unpause(): Owner unpauses the contract.
 *    - rescueERC20(address token, uint256 amount, address recipient): Owner can rescue non-allowed or stuck ERC20 tokens.
 *    - setMinVotingDuration(uint256 duration): Owner sets minimum voting period length.
 *    - setVotingThresholds(uint256 quorumNumerator, uint256 approvalNumerator, uint256 denominator): Owner sets quorum and approval percentage (e.g., 4/10 for 40% quorum, 6/10 for 60% approval).
 *
 * Total Functions: 4 (Fund) + 5 (Proposal) + 8 (Voting/Evaluation) + 3 (Funding) + 2 (Rewards) + 5 (Utility) = 27 functions.
