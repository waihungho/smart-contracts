Okay, let's design a smart contract concept that combines elements of probabilistic outcomes, time-based conditions, and the *simulation* of advanced concepts like "measurement" changing a state (inspired by quantum mechanics) and integration points for Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK-Proof) verification. We'll call it `QuantumConditionalVault`.

This contract allows users to deposit funds under specific conditions that are initially uncertain (a simulated "superposition" of states) and only become definite upon a "measurement" event, which could be triggered by a verifiable external input (like a simulated ZK proof result or a future block property).

**Disclaimer:** This contract simulates complex concepts (like quantum superposition and ZK proofs) within the constraints of Solidity. A real-world ZK integration requires actual proof verification circuits and potentially external verifiers. The "quantum" aspect is a conceptual model for state transitions based on uncertain conditions and measurement, not actual quantum computation. Using `blockhash` for randomness is generally insecure for high-value applications due to miner manipulability; a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) like Chainlink VRF is recommended in production.

**Contract: QuantumConditionalVault**

**Outline:**

1.  **Core Concept:** A vault holding user funds that can only be unlocked if specific conditions, initially uncertain ("superposed"), are met after a "measurement" event.
2.  **States:**
    *   `Superposed`: Lock created, conditions uncertain/unverified.
    *   `Measured`: Measurement triggered, condition outcome determined.
    *   `Unlocked`: Funds successfully claimed.
    *   `Failed`: Condition not met or lock expired without measurement.
3.  **Lock Types (Conditions):**
    *   Type 1: Time-based + Simulated Block Hash Randomness.
    *   Type 2: Time-based + Simulated ZK Proof Verification Result.
    *   Type 3: Pure Simulated ZK Proof Verification Result (no time lock).
    *   Type 4: Time-based + External Oracle Data (conceptually, simulated).
4.  **Key Mechanisms:**
    *   Deposit funds linked to a specific lock ID.
    *   Define condition parameters upon creation.
    *   `triggerMeasurement` function: Initiates the condition check based on external/future state. Requires appropriate inputs (e.g., simulated ZK proof output).
    *   `attemptUnlock` function: Checks the *result* of the measurement and moves to `Unlocked` or `Failed`.
    *   `claimUnlocked` function: Allows the depositor to withdraw funds if state is `Unlocked`.
    *   Admin functions (Pause, Fees, Update Verifiers).
    *   Query functions to check lock state, details, user locks, etc.
5.  **Simulated Advanced Concepts:**
    *   "Superposition" -> "Measurement" state transition.
    *   ZK Proof Integration (simulated by accepting a boolean `_zkProofResult`).
    *   Probabilistic outcome (simulated by `blockhash`).

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the owner, sets initial fee.
2.  `createQuantumLock_TimeAndBlockHash`: Creates a lock dependent on a future block's hash meeting a criterion after a minimum time.
3.  `createQuantumLock_ZKProof`: Creates a lock dependent on a simulated ZK proof verification result after a minimum time.
4.  `createQuantumLock_PureZK`: Creates a lock dependent *only* on a simulated ZK proof verification result.
5.  `createQuantumLock_TimeAndOracle`: Creates a lock dependent on a simulated oracle data value after a minimum time.
6.  `triggerMeasurement_BlockHash`: Attempts to trigger measurement for a block hash lock. Checks time and calculates outcome based on block hash.
7.  `triggerMeasurement_ZKProof`: Attempts to trigger measurement for a ZK proof lock using a provided simulated result.
8.  `triggerMeasurement_PureZK`: Attempts to trigger measurement for a pure ZK proof lock using a provided simulated result.
9.  `triggerMeasurement_Oracle`: Attempts to trigger measurement for an oracle lock using a provided simulated oracle data value.
10. `attemptUnlock`: Checks if a lock's condition was met after measurement and updates state to `Unlocked` or `Failed`.
11. `claimUnlocked`: Allows the depositor to withdraw funds from an `Unlocked` lock.
12. `cancelLock_BeforeMeasurement`: Allows the depositor to cancel a lock *before* the measurement window opens (refunds funds minus fee).
13. `getLockState`: Returns the current state of a specific lock.
14. `getLockDetails`: Returns comprehensive details about a specific lock.
15. `getUserLocks`: Returns an array of lock IDs owned by a user.
16. `getTotalLockedValue`: Returns the total value currently held across all active locks.
17. `getTotalValueByState`: Returns the total value in locks for a specific state.
18. `pause`: Owner function to pause the contract.
19. `unpause`: Owner function to unpause the contract.
20. `withdrawFees`: Owner function to withdraw collected fees.
21. `setLockFee`: Owner function to update the fee percentage.
22. `setZKVerifierAddress`: Owner function to update the simulated ZK verifier address (conceptually).
23. `setOracleAddress`: Owner function to update the simulated oracle address (conceptually).
24. `renounceOwnership`: Owner function from Ownable.
25. `owner`: Getter for owner.
26. `paused`: Getter for pause state.
27. `isLockMeasurable`: Checks if a lock's measurement window is currently open.
28. `checkConditionMet`: Internal helper to check if the *measured* condition is true.
29. `_simulateZKVerify`: Internal helper simulating ZK verification.
30. `_simulateOracleData`: Internal helper simulating fetching oracle data.
