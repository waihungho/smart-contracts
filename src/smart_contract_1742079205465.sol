/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation and Task Marketplace with Dynamic Pricing & Skill-Based Matching
 * @author Bard (Example Smart Contract - Not for Production)
 * @notice This smart contract implements a decentralized marketplace where users can build reputation through task completion.
 * It features dynamic task pricing based on demand and urgency, skill-based task matching, reputation-based access, and a dispute resolution mechanism.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **User Reputation System:**
 *    - User Registration and Profiling (skills, interests)
 *    - Reputation Points Accumulation through Task Completion
 *    - Reputation Levels and Badges
 *    - Reputation Decay (optional, not implemented for simplicity)
 *    - View User Reputation and Profile
 *
 * 2. **Task Management:**
 *    - Task Creation (with skills required, budget, deadline, urgency level)
 *    - Task Bidding System (Task Performers bid with proposed price and timeframe)
 *    - Task Assignment (Task Creator selects a bid based on reputation, price, timeframe, etc.)
 *    - Task Submission and Review
 *    - Task Completion and Reward Distribution
 *    - Task Cancellation and Dispute Mechanism
 *    - Dynamic Task Pricing (based on urgency and number of open tasks of similar skill)
 *    - Skill-Based Task Matching (recommend tasks based on user skills)
 *    - Task Search and Filtering (by skills, budget, deadline)
 *
 * 3. **Staking and Governance (Basic):**
 *    - Staking for Reputation Boost (optional feature - not fully implemented for simplicity, but function present)
 *    - Governance Proposals (basic - setting platform fees or parameters - not fully implemented)
 *
 * 4. **Utility and Admin Functions:**
 *    - Platform Fee Management
 *    - Pause/Unpause Contract
 *    - Withdraw Platform Fees
 *    - Event Logging for key actions
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * 1. `registerUser(string _userName, string[] _skills)`: Allows a user to register on the platform with a username and skills.
 * 2. `updateUserProfile(string _newUserName, string[] _newSkills)`: Allows a registered user to update their username and skills.
 * 3. `getUserProfile(address _userAddress)`: Retrieves the profile information (username, skills, reputation) of a user.
 * 4. `getUserReputation(address _userAddress)`: Retrieves the reputation score of a user.
 * 5. `createTask(string _taskTitle, string _taskDescription, string[] _requiredSkills, uint256 _budget, uint256 _deadline, uint8 _urgencyLevel)`: Allows a user to create a new task with details, budget, deadline, and urgency.
 * 6. `getTaskDetails(uint256 _taskId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific task.
 * 7. `bidOnTask(uint256 _taskId, uint256 _proposedPrice, uint256 _proposedDeadline)`: Allows a registered user to bid on a task with a proposed price and deadline.
 * 8. `getTaskBids(uint256 _taskId)`: Retrieves all bids submitted for a specific task.
 * 9. `acceptBid(uint256 _taskId, address _bidderAddress)`: Allows the task creator to accept a bid and assign the task to a bidder.
 * 10. `submitTask(uint256 _taskId, string _submissionDetails)`: Allows the assigned task performer to submit their work for review.
 * 11. `reviewSubmission(uint256 _taskId, bool _taskCompleted)`: Allows the task creator to review the submission and mark the task as completed or raise a dispute.
 * 12. `completeTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Completes the task, distributes rewards, and updates reputation scores (internal function called after review).
 * 13. `cancelTask(uint256 _taskId)`: Allows the task creator to cancel a task before it is accepted (with potential fee implications).
 * 14. `raiseDispute(uint256 _taskId, string _disputeReason)`: Allows either the task creator or performer to raise a dispute if there are issues.
 * 15. `resolveDispute(uint256 _taskId, address _winner)`: (Admin/Moderator function) Resolves a dispute and determines the winner (reward distribution and reputation impact).
 * 16. `getDynamicTaskPrice(string[] _requiredSkills, uint8 _urgencyLevel)`: Calculates the dynamic price for a task based on skills and urgency.
 * 17. `recommendTasksForUser(address _userAddress)`: Recommends tasks to a user based on their skills.
 * 18. `searchTasksBySkills(string[] _skills)`: Allows users to search for tasks based on required skills.
 * 19. `stakeForReputationBoost(uint256 _stakeAmount)`: (Optional Feature) Allows users to stake tokens to temporarily boost their reputation.
 * 20. `withdrawStake()`: (Optional Feature) Allows users to withdraw their staked tokens.
 * 21. `setPlatformFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: (Admin function) Sets the platform fee percentage.
 * 22. `getPlatformFee()`: Retrieves the current platform fee percentage.
 * 23. `withdrawPlatformFees()`: (Admin function) Allows the admin to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 * 24. `pauseContract()`: (Admin function) Pauses the contract, preventing most state-changing functions.
 * 25. `unpauseContract()`: (Admin function) Unpauses the contract, restoring normal functionality.

**Explanation of Concepts and Functionality:**

This smart contract implements a decentralized reputation and task marketplace with several interesting and advanced concepts:

1.  **Decentralized Reputation System:**
    *   Users register with usernames and skills.
    *   Reputation scores are tracked and updated based on task completion.
    *   Reputation serves as a measure of trust and reliability within the marketplace.
    *   `registerUser`, `updateUserProfile`, `getUserProfile`, `getUserReputation`, `_updateReputation` functions manage this system.

2.  **Task Marketplace with Bidding and Assignment:**
    *   Users can create tasks with detailed descriptions, required skills, budgets, and deadlines.
    *   Performers can bid on tasks, proposing their price and timeframe.
    *   Task creators can review bids and assign tasks to suitable performers.
    *   `createTask`, `getTaskDetails`, `bidOnTask`, `getTaskBids`, `acceptBid`, `submitTask`, `reviewSubmission`, `completeTask`, `cancelTask` functions handle task lifecycle.

3.  **Dynamic Task Pricing (Basic Implementation):**
    *   The `getDynamicTaskPrice` function demonstrates a basic concept of dynamic pricing based on task urgency and required skills.
    *   In a real-world scenario, this could be much more sophisticated, considering factors like:
        *   Demand for specific skills (number of open tasks requiring those skills).
        *   Urgency levels.
        *   Historical task completion rates for similar tasks.
        *   Reputation of the task creator (higher reputation might attract lower bids).

4.  **Skill-Based Task Matching and Recommendations:**
    *   `recommendTasksForUser` function suggests tasks to users based on their registered skills.
    *   `searchTasksBySkills` allows users to search for tasks requiring specific skills.
    *   This improves task discoverability and connects the right performers with the right tasks.

5.  **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:**
    *   A basic dispute resolution process is included.
    *   If a task is not completed to the creator's satisfaction, a dispute can be raised.
    *   An admin (`resolveDispute` function) can intervene to resolve disputes and determine the outcome (who wins, reward distribution, reputation impact).

6.  **Staking for Reputation Boost (Optional and Basic):**
    *   The `stakeForReputationBoost` function is a placeholder for an optional feature where users could stake tokens to temporarily boost their reputation.
    *   In a real implementation, this would involve more complex logic for managing staked tokens, calculating reputation boosts, and handling unstaking.

7.  **Platform Fee Management:**
    *   The contract includes a platform fee percentage that is deducted from task budgets.
    *   Admin functions (`setPlatformFee`, `getPlatformFee`, `withdrawPlatformFees`) manage platform fees.

8.  **Admin Control and Utility Functions:**
    *   The contract is `Ownable`, allowing the contract owner (admin) to:
        *   Set platform fees.
        *   Withdraw platform fees.
        *   Pause and unpause the contract for maintenance or emergency situations.
    *   `pauseContract`, `unpauseContract`, `setPlatformFee`, `withdrawPlatformFees` are admin functions.

**Advanced and Creative Aspects:**

*   **Combined Reputation and Task Marketplace:**  Integrating a reputation system directly into a task marketplace creates a self-regulating ecosystem where trust and quality are incentivized.
*   **Dynamic Pricing (Concept):**  Moving beyond fixed task prices to dynamic pricing based on market conditions and task attributes is a more advanced economic model for a decentralized marketplace.
*   **Skill-Based Matching and Recommendations:** Enhancing user experience and efficiency by intelligently matching tasks with users based on skills.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** Implementing a basic dispute mechanism within the smart contract adds a layer of trust and fairness to the decentralized platform.
*   **Staking for Reputation Boost (Potential):**  Exploring tokenomic models to incentivize user engagement and reputation building through staking (though basic here).

**Important Notes:**

*   **Not for Production:** This is an example smart contract for demonstration purposes. It is not intended for production use and would require significant security audits, testing, and further development for real-world deployment.
*   **Security Considerations:**  Security is paramount in smart contracts. This example is simplified and may have vulnerabilities. A production contract would need rigorous security audits to prevent exploits (e.g., reentrancy, access control issues, etc.).
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Gas optimization is important for real-world smart contracts to minimize transaction costs. This example is written for clarity and conceptual demonstration and may not be fully optimized for gas efficiency.
*   **Error Handling and User Experience:**  More robust error handling and better user feedback mechanisms would be needed for a production-ready application.
*   **Scalability and Off-Chain Components:**  For a real-world marketplace, scalability and off-chain components (e.g., for complex task matching algorithms, data storage, user interfaces) would be crucial.

This contract provides a foundation and illustrates several creative and advanced concepts that can be incorporated into a decentralized task marketplace. You can expand upon these ideas to build even more sophisticated and feature-rich decentralized applications.
