 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)

 * @dev This smart contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It allows artists to mint NFTs, curators to propose and vote on art exhibitions,
 * collectors to purchase and support art, and the community to govern the collective.
 * This contract explores advanced concepts like decentralized curation, dynamic royalties,
 * community-driven exhibitions, and reputation-based governance, aiming to be a
 * creative and trendy platform for digital art within the blockchain space,
 * avoiding duplication of existing open-source contracts.

 * **Outline and Function Summary:**

 * **1. NFT Management:**
 *    - mintArtNFT: Allows artists to mint Art NFTs with metadata and set initial royalty.
 *    - transferArtNFT: Standard ERC721 transfer function with permission checks.
 *    - setArtMetadataURI: Allows the artist to update the metadata URI of their NFT.
 *    - burnArtNFT: Allows the artist to burn their NFT (with certain conditions).
 *    - getArtNFTInfo: Returns detailed information about a specific Art NFT.

 * **2. Curation and Exhibition Proposals:**
 *    - proposeExhibition: Allows members to propose new art exhibitions with themes and curation details.
 *    - voteOnExhibitionProposal: Allows members to vote for or against an exhibition proposal.
 *    - executeExhibitionProposal: Executes a successful exhibition proposal, creating the exhibition.
 *    - submitArtForExhibition: Allows NFT holders to submit their art for a specific exhibition.
 *    - curatorVoteOnArtSubmission: Allows appointed curators to vote on submitted art for an exhibition.
 *    - finalizeExhibition: Finalizes an exhibition after curation, listing approved artworks.

 * **3. Marketplace and Royalties:**
 *    - listArtForSale: Allows NFT owners to list their Art NFTs for sale in the DAAC marketplace.
 *    - purchaseArtNFT: Allows collectors to purchase listed Art NFTs, with royalty distribution.
 *    - setDynamicRoyalty: Allows artists to set a dynamic royalty structure based on sales price tiers.
 *    - withdrawArtistEarnings: Allows artists to withdraw their accumulated earnings from sales and royalties.

 * **4. Community Governance and Reputation:**
 *    - becomeMember: Allows users to become members of the DAAC by staking a certain amount of tokens (example).
 *    - proposeGovernanceChange: Allows members to propose changes to DAAC governance parameters.
 *    - voteOnGovernanceChange: Allows members to vote on governance change proposals.
 *    - executeGovernanceChange: Executes a successful governance change proposal.
 *    - contributeToDAACTreasury: Allows anyone to contribute to the DAAC treasury.
 *    - withdrawFromDAACTreasury: Allows authorized roles to withdraw funds from the treasury (governance controlled).

 * **5. Utility and Information Functions:**
 *    - getExhibitionInfo: Returns information about a specific exhibition.
 *    - getActiveExhibitions: Returns a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *    - getMemberInfo: Returns information about a DAAC member.
 *    - getDAACTreasuryBalance: Returns the current balance of the DAAC treasury.
