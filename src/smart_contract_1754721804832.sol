Here's a Solidity smart contract for a "Self-Evolving Decentralized Autonomous Guild/Syndicate" (SEDAGS), named **ChronosDAO**. It aims to implement advanced concepts like time-weighted influence, dynamic reputation (Wisdom Score), adaptive governance, and an internal task/dispute resolution system, while avoiding direct duplication of existing open-source projects by focusing on unique combinations and custom logic for these functionalities.

## ChronosDAO: A Time-Weighted & Adaptive DAO Framework

### Description
The `ChronosDAO` is a highly advanced Decentralized Autonomous Organization framework designed for long-term, self-sustaining communities. Unlike traditional DAOs primarily reliant on token-weighted voting, ChronosDAO introduces a multifaceted influence system that considers **time-weighted token staking**, on-chain **contributions**, and an accumulated **"Wisdom Score"**. It emphasizes dynamic adaptation, incentivizes active participation, and includes robust internal mechanisms for task management, dispute resolution, and even the ability to spawn specialized sub-DAOs.

### Core Concepts:
1.  **Time-Weighted Influence**: Staked governance tokens gain more influence (voting power) the longer they are held. This incentivizes long-term commitment over short-term speculation.
2.  **Wisdom/Reputation System**: Members earn "Wisdom Score" for valuable on-chain actions such as submitting successful proposals, completing verified tasks, and participating in dispute resolution. This score contributes to their total influence and can unlock dynamic roles or achievement NFTs.
3.  **Dynamic Membership NFTs**: Future integration could allow for a dynamic ERC721 NFT to represent membership, whose attributes evolve with a member's Wisdom Score and assigned roles, granting unique privileges or visual representations. (Interface placeholder included).
4.  **Adaptive Governance**: Core DAO parameters (e.g., proposal quorum, voting periods, optimistic execution delays) are not fixed but can be adjusted over time via governance proposals, allowing the DAO to evolve its own rules based on its community's needs and performance.
5.  **Internal Task & Dispute Resolution**: Built-in modules for members to create, apply for, assign, and verify tasks with associated rewards, and to submit/resolve disputes internally via a council (members with `ARBITER_ROLE`).
6.  **Optimistic Proposal Execution**: For low-risk or minor proposals, a faster "optimistic" execution path exists where proposals can be executed after a short delay, *unless challenged* by a member. A challenge forces a full vote.
7.  **Sub-DAO Spawning**: The main DAO can vote to create new, specialized sub-DAOs, potentially endowing them with initial funds and specific mandates, enabling modular and hierarchical decentralized organization.

### Architectural Notes:
*   **External Token Dependency**: Relies on an external ERC20 token contract (specified at deployment) for its governance token and an external ERC721 contract for Wisdom Achievement NFTs. Placeholders for these interfaces are used.
*   **OpenZeppelin Libraries**: Utilizes standard, audited OpenZeppelin contracts (`Ownable`, `IERC20`, `IERC721`, `Context`, `SafeMath`, `ReentrancyGuard`) for foundational security and best practices, but the core innovative logic is custom.
*   **Treasury Management**: The DAO manages an internal balance of its governance token which acts as its treasury. Funds are transferred into and out of this treasury via governance proposals.
*   **Flexibility**: Designed to be extensible. New roles, skills, and types of proposals can be added.

### Function Summary:

Here is a summary of the public/external functions available in the `ChronosDAO` contract:

1.  **`constructor(address _daoTokenAddress)`**:
    *   Initializes the contract upon deployment, setting the address of the ERC20 governance token and default governance parameters.

2.  **`initializeDAOParameters(uint256 _votingPeriod, uint256 _executionDelay, uint256 _quorumPercentage, uint256 _challengePeriod, uint256 _disputePeriod, address _wisdomNFT, address _subDAOFactory)`**:
    *   **(Admin Only)** Sets the initial, core governance parameters and links external NFT/SubDAO factory contracts. Callable once after deployment. Subsequent changes require a governance proposal.

3.  **`emergencyPause()`**:
    *   **(Admin Only)** Temporarily pauses critical DAO functions (staking, proposing, executing) in case of an emergency.

4.  **`emergencyUnpause()`**:
    *   **(Admin Only)** Resumes normal operations after an emergency pause.

5.  **`stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`**:
    *   Allows a user to stake governance tokens into the DAO's treasury, gaining influence. Time-weighted influence accumulation begins.

6.  **`unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`**:
    *   Allows a user to withdraw their staked governance tokens, reducing their influence.

7.  **`getMemberInfluence(address _member)`**:
    *   **View Function**: Calculates and returns a member's current total influence, factoring in their time-weighted stake and accumulated Wisdom Score, accounting for any outbound delegation.

8.  **`delegateInfluence(address _delegatee)`**:
    *   Allows a member to delegate their total voting influence to another member. The delegator loses their direct voting power.

9.  **`undelegateInfluence()`**:
    *   Revokes a previously established delegation, restoring the delegator's direct voting influence.

10. **`submitProposal(string calldata _description, address[] calldata _targets, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes[] calldata _callData, bool _optimistic)`**:
    *   Allows eligible members to submit new proposals for DAO actions (e.g., treasury transfers, parameter updates). Can be marked as `_optimistic` for faster execution.

11. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**:
    *   Allows members to cast their vote (for or against) on an active proposal using their effective influence.

12. **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**:
    *   Finalizes a proposal. For regular proposals, checks voting period and quorum. For optimistic proposals, checks challenge period. Executes the proposed on-chain calls if conditions are met.

13. **`challengeOptimisticProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**:
    *   Allows an eligible member to challenge an optimistic proposal within its challenge period, forcing it to undergo a full, regular voting process.

14. **`cancelProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**:
    *   Allows the original proposer to cancel their proposal under certain conditions (e.g., before execution or if it failed).

15. **`claimWisdomAchievementNFT(uint256 _wisdomThreshold)`**:
    *   Allows a member to mint or update a dynamic NFT representing their Wisdom Score achievement upon reaching specified thresholds.

16. **`proposeRoleAssignment(address _member, string calldata _roleName)`**:
    *   Submits a governance proposal to assign a specific role (e.g., `ARBITER_ROLE`, `TASK_VERIFIER_ROLE`) to a member.

17. **`proposeRoleRevocation(address _member, string calldata _roleName)`**:
    *   Submits a governance proposal to revoke a specific role from a member.

18. **`registerSkill(string calldata _skillName)`**:
    *   Allows a member to declare a skill they possess, which can then be used for task matching.

19. **`createTask(string calldata _description, uint256 _rewardAmount, string calldata _requiredSkillName)`**:
    *   Allows a member to create a new task for the DAO, specifying its description, DAO token reward, and required skill.

20. **`applyForTask(uint256 _taskId)`**:
    *   Allows members with the required skills to apply for an open task.

21. **`assignTask(uint256 _taskId, address _assignee)`**:
    *   Assigns an applied task to a specific member. Callable by the task creator or a `TASK_VERIFIER_ROLE`.

22. **`completeTask(uint256 _taskId)`**:
    *   Marks an assigned task as completed by the assigned member, awaiting verification.

23. **`verifyTask(uint256 _taskId)`**:
    *   Verifies a completed task. Callable by the task creator or a `TASK_VERIFIER_ROLE`. If verified, the reward is distributed and wisdom points are awarded.

24. **`depositToTreasury(uint256 _amount)`**:
    *   Allows any user to deposit DAO tokens directly into the DAO's treasury.

25. **`proposeTreasuryTransfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, string calldata _description)`**:
    *   Submits a proposal for the DAO to vote on transferring a specified amount of DAO tokens from its treasury to a recipient.

26. **`proposeTreasuryDiversification(string calldata _strategyDetails, address[] calldata _targetAssets, uint256[] calldata _targetPercentages)`**:
    *   Submits a conceptual proposal for the DAO to vote on a treasury diversification strategy (e.g., allocating funds to different assets). (Requires off-chain or advanced on-chain integration to execute fully).

27. **`submitDispute(address _accused, string calldata _description)`**:
    *   Allows a member to submit a formal dispute against another member, initiating an internal arbitration process.

28. **`voteOnDispute(uint256 _disputeId, bool _supportAccused)`**:
    *   Allows members with the `ARBITER_ROLE` to cast their vote (for or against the accused) on an active dispute.

29. **`resolveDispute(uint256 _disputeId)`**:
    *   Finalizes a dispute after the voting period, applying any determined penalties (e.g., reduction in wisdom score) or exoneration based on the arbitration outcome.

30. **`triggerAdaptiveParameterUpdate(string calldata _reason)`**:
    *   Initiates a governance proposal for the DAO to collectively discuss and vote on adjusting its own core governance parameters, fostering self-improvement.

31. **`proposeSpawnSubDAO(string calldata _subDAOName, uint256 _initialFunds, address _governanceTokenForSubDAO)`**:
    *   Allows the DAO to vote on creating a new, specialized sub-DAO via a factory contract, optionally endowing it with initial funds and defining its governance token.
