 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary
 * @author Gemini AI
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized autonomous art gallery, enabling artists to showcase,
 * curate, and monetize their digital art (NFTs) in a community-governed environment.
 *
 * **Contract Overview:**
 *
 * This contract implements a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) where artists can register,
 * submit their digital artworks (represented as NFTs), and participate in community-driven curation
 * and exhibition processes. The gallery is governed by a simple DAO mechanism, allowing token holders
 * to vote on proposals related to gallery operations, artist onboarding, exhibition themes, and more.
 *
 * **Core Concepts:**
 *
 * 1. **Artist Registration & Tier System:** Artists can register and are initially placed in a 'Pending' tier.
 *    Successful artists can be promoted to higher tiers based on community votes or curator decisions,
 *    unlocking benefits like higher visibility, featured exhibitions, and revenue share.
 *
 * 2. **Art Submission & Curation:** Artists submit their NFT artworks along with metadata. A decentralized
 *    curation process involving community voting or designated curators determines which artworks
 *    are accepted into the gallery.
 *
 * 3. **Exhibitions & Themes:**  The DAO can propose and vote on exhibition themes. Curators (elected or
 *    designated by the DAO) can then select artworks from the gallery's collection that fit the theme
 *    to create exhibitions.
 *
 * 4. **Decentralized Governance (DAO):**  A simple DAO mechanism is integrated using a governance token.
 *    Token holders can propose and vote on gallery parameters, artist approvals, curator selections,
 *    exhibition themes, and treasury management (if implemented).
 *
 * 5. **Revenue Sharing & Monetization:**  The gallery can implement various monetization strategies
 *    (e.g., commissions on secondary NFT sales, entry fees for special exhibitions, sponsored events).
 *    Revenue can be shared with artists, curators, and the DAO treasury based on predefined rules
 *    or DAO-governed proposals.
 *
 * **Function Summary (20+ Functions):**
 *
 * **Artist Functions:**
 *   1. `registerArtist(string _artistName, string _artistBio)`: Allows artists to register with name and bio.
 *   2. `submitArtwork(string _artworkTitle, string _artworkDescription, string _artworkIPFSHash)`: Artists submit artwork details (title, description, IPFS hash).
 *   3. `updateArtistProfile(string _newBio)`: Artists can update their bio.
 *   4. `withdrawEarnings()`: Artists can withdraw their earned revenue from the gallery.
 *   5. `getArtistProfile(address _artistAddress) view`: View public artist profile information.
 *
 * **Gallery Administration (DAO/Admin Functions):**
 *   6. `approveArtist(address _artistAddress)`: DAO/Admin approves a pending artist registration.
 *   7. `rejectArtist(address _artistAddress)`: DAO/Admin rejects an artist registration.
 *   8. `promoteArtistTier(address _artistAddress, uint8 _newTier)`: DAO/Admin promotes an artist to a higher tier.
 *   9. `demoteArtistTier(address _artistAddress, uint8 _newTier)`: DAO/Admin demotes an artist to a lower tier.
 *  10. `createExhibitionProposal(string _exhibitionTitle, string _exhibitionDescription, uint256 _votingDuration)`: DAO proposes a new exhibition theme.
 *  11. `voteOnExhibitionProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Token holders vote on exhibition proposals.
 *  12. `selectArtworkForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256[] _artworkIds)`: Curators (or DAO) select artworks for a specific exhibition.
 *  13. `setCurator(address _curatorAddress, bool _isCurator)`: DAO/Admin appoints or removes curators.
 *  14. `setGalleryFee(uint256 _newFeePercentage)`: DAO/Admin sets the gallery fee percentage on secondary sales.
 *  15. `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause core functionalities in case of emergency.
 *  16. `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to resume contract functionalities.
 *
 * **User/Visitor Functions:**
 *  17. `viewArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId) view`: View details of a specific artwork in the gallery.
 *  18. `viewExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId) view`: View details of a specific exhibition.
 *  19. `getAllApprovedArtworks() view`: View a list of all approved artworks in the gallery.
 *  20. `getArtworksByArtist(address _artistAddress) view`: View artworks submitted by a specific artist.
 *  21. `getActiveExhibitions() view`: View a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *  22. `getPendingArtistApplications() view`: View a list of pending artist applications (admin only).
 *  23. `getGalleryRevenueBalance() view`: View the current balance of the gallery revenue (admin/DAO).
 *
 * **Events:**
 *   - `ArtistRegistered(address artistAddress, string artistName)`
 *   - `ArtworkSubmitted(uint256 artworkId, address artistAddress, string artworkTitle)`
 *   - `ArtistApproved(address artistAddress)`
 *   - `ArtistRejected(address artistAddress)`
