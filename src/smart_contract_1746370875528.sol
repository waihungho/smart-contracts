Okay, let's design a smart contract that simulates a "Quantum-inspired Swarm Optimization" process on-chain.

**Concept:** The contract defines an abstract optimization problem represented by a set of integer parameters within specific ranges. Users (acting as "particles" in the swarm) submit proposed solutions (sets of parameters). The contract calculates a "fitness" score for each submission based on a predefined internal function. It tracks the best solution found globally by any participant and the best solution found by each individual participant. Rewards (in an ERC-20 token) are distributed for finding new global best solutions and potentially for improving personal bests.

This concept is:
*   **Interesting/Creative:** Simulating an optimization process decentralizes the search for a solution.
*   **Advanced:** Involves state tracking for multiple participants and a dynamic objective (the best solution).
*   **Trendy:** Touches on concepts related to decentralized coordination and potentially AI/ML (using swarm techniques). "Quantum-inspired" adds a modern flair, though the on-chain math is classical.
*   **Non-Duplicate:** While components like ERC-20 handling and state tracking are common, this specific application of swarm optimization on-chain is not a standard open-source pattern like a DEX, lending protocol, or basic NFT.

**Limitations (Important to note):**
*   On-chain computation is expensive and limited. The fitness function must be simple. Complex, floating-point, or computationally intensive optimization problems cannot be solved *directly* within this contract; off-chain computation with on-chain verification would be needed for that, adding significant complexity (ZK proofs, oracles, etc., which are beyond the scope of a single Solidity contract example aiming for 20+ *basic* interactions). This contract focuses on the *management* and *incentivization* of the search process based on a simple on-chain fitness evaluation.
*   "Quantum-inspired" refers to the *concept* of exploring a solution space guided by best findings (like quantum annealing or PSO) rather than actual quantum computation.

**Outline and Function Summary**

**Contract Name:** `QuantumSwarmOptimizer`

**Description:** A smart contract that manages a decentralized, incentivized optimization process. Users submit parameter sets ("solutions"), and the contract tracks global and personal bests based on an internal fitness function, distributing ERC-20 rewards.

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Optimization Problem:** Defined by parameter dimensions, ranges, and a target (for fitness calculation).
*   **Particles/Swarm:** Users submitting solutions.
*   **Fitness Function:** An on-chain function calculating the quality of a solution.
*   **Global Best:** The solution with the highest fitness found across all participants.
*   **Personal Best:** The solution with the highest fitness found by a specific participant.
*   **Rewards:** ERC-20 tokens distributed for finding new bests.
*   **Rounds:** The optimization can be run in rounds, potentially resetting personal/global bests to encourage new exploration.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Contract owner.
*   `optimizationActive`: Flag indicating if submissions are allowed.
*   `currentRound`: The current optimization round number.
*   `rewardToken`: Address of the ERC-20 token used for rewards.
*   `problem`: Struct defining optimization dimensions and parameter ranges.
*   `fitnessDefinition`: Struct defining parameters used by the fitness function (e.g., target values, weights).
*   `optimizationParameters`: Struct defining configuration (e.g., submission fee, reward amounts).
*   `globalBestState`: Array of parameters for the global best solution.
*   `globalBestFitness`: Fitness value of the global best solution.
*   `particleStates`: Mapping from user address to their current submitted state.
*   `particleBestStates`: Mapping from user address to their personal best state.
*   `particleBestFitnesses`: Mapping from user address to their personal best fitness.
*   `pendingRewards`: Mapping from user address to their claimable rewards.
*   `particleCount`: Number of unique addresses that have submitted a solution.

**Structs:**
*   `OptimizationProblem`: `uint dimensions`, `uint[] minRanges`, `uint[] maxRanges`.
*   `FitnessDefinition`: `uint[] targetParams`, `uint[] weights`.
*   `OptimizationParameters`: `uint submissionFee`, `uint globalBestRewardAmount`, `uint personalBestRewardPercentage`.
*   `ParticleState`: `uint[] params`, `uint fitness`.

**Events:**
*   `ProblemDefined`: When the optimization problem is set.
*   `FitnessFunctionDefined`: When the fitness function parameters are set.
*   `ParametersSet`: When optimization parameters are set.
*   `OptimizationStarted`: When optimization is activated.
*   `OptimizationPaused`: When optimization is paused.
*   `SolutionSubmitted`: When a user submits a solution.
*   `NewGlobalBest`: When a new global best solution is found.
*   `NewPersonalBest`: When a user improves their personal best.
*   `RewardsClaimed`: When a user claims rewards.
*   `NewRoundStarted`: When a new optimization round begins.

**Functions (28 functions):**

**Owner/Setup Functions:**
1.  `constructor(address _rewardToken)`: Initializes owner and reward token.
2.  `defineOptimizationProblem(uint _dimensions, uint[] memory _minRanges, uint[] memory _maxRanges)`: Sets the problem structure (dimensions, ranges).
3.  `setFitnessFunctionDefinition(uint[] memory _targetParams, uint[] memory _weights)`: Sets parameters for the internal fitness calculation.
4.  `setOptimizationParameters(uint _submissionFee, uint _globalBestRewardAmount, uint _personalBestRewardPercentage)`: Sets configuration parameters like fees and reward amounts.
5.  `startOptimization()`: Activates the optimization process, allowing submissions.
6.  `pauseOptimization()`: Pauses the optimization process, disallowing submissions.
7.  `fundRewards()`: Allows the owner to send reward tokens to the contract.
8.  `withdrawFunds(address _token, uint _amount)`: Allows the owner to withdraw any token from the contract (for managing reward token or withdrawing accidental sends).
9.  `startNewRound()`: Increments the round number, potentially resetting certain states (e.g., personal bests, depending on logic). Resets global best fitness to 0 to encourage finding a new one in the round.

**User Interaction Functions:**
10. `submitSolution(uint[] memory _params)`: User submits a candidate solution (parameter array). Requires fee payment. Contract calculates fitness, updates personal/global bests, and accrues rewards.
11. `claimRewards()`: User claims their accumulated pending ERC-20 rewards.
12. `resetParticleState()`: User resets their personal best state and fitness, potentially to explore a different search area.

**Owner Management Functions:**
13. `manualSetGlobalBest(uint[] memory _params, uint _fitness)`: Allows the owner to manually set the global best solution (e.g., based on verified off-chain computation). Requires validation of parameters against problem definition.
14. `resetAllParticleStates()`: Owner can reset the personal best state and fitness for *all* participants.
15. `setRewardToken(address _newRewardToken)`: Owner can change the address of the reward token.

**Internal/Helper Functions (Not directly callable externally in most cases):**
16. `_calculateFitness(uint[] memory _params) internal view returns (uint)`: Calculates the fitness score for a given parameter set based on `fitnessDefinition` and `problem` bounds. (Fitness logic defined within this function).
17. `_validateState(uint[] memory _params) internal view`: Checks if a parameter array matches the problem dimensions and is within the defined ranges.

**View Functions (Read-only):**
18. `getGlobalBestState() view returns (uint[] memory)`: Returns the parameters of the current global best solution.
19. `getGlobalBestFitness() view returns (uint)`: Returns the fitness value of the current global best solution.
20. `getParticleState(address _particle) view returns (uint[] memory)`: Returns the current submitted state of a specific particle.

        // or require addresses to be passed in, or accept the gas cost for a simple example.
        // A simple state mapping reset is demonstrated here, assuming addresses could be obtained.

        //    // pendingRewards[particleAddress] = 0;

        // As we cannot iterate mappings, we will make this function a placeholder
        // or only functional if participant addresses are tracked differently (e.g., in an array).
        // Let's simplify and assume the owner *could* provide a list of addresses or accept the limitation.
        // We will keep the function signature but acknowledge the iteration challenge.
        // A more advanced design might use a list of participant addresses maintained on submission.
        // Adding a list adds complexity to submitSolution (pushing address).

        // Let's add a state variable to track unique participants to allow this function to potentially iterate.
        // This makes submitSolution slightly more complex.
        // Adding mapping `hasSubmitted[address] = bool` and a counter `_particleCount`.
        // We still cannot iterate `hasSubmitted` mapping directly.
        // The most practical on-chain approach for a global reset without knowing all addresses is not trivial.
        // A common pattern is a phased approach where users *opt-in* to a new round.

        // Given the constraint of providing a working example, let's keep the function
        // but add a comment acknowledging the iteration challenge for a large number of users.
        // A true implementation might require addresses to be passed in batches.
        // For demonstration, we'll just have the function signature. A full implementation
        // would need a list/set of participant addresses.
