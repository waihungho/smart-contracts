 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for a decentralized art gallery, incorporating advanced concepts 
 *      beyond typical NFT marketplaces and DAOs. This contract focuses on community-driven curation, 
 *      dynamic art exhibitions, fractional ownership, artist reputation, and innovative features.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Core Art Management:**
 *   - `mintArtwork(string memory _artworkURI, string memory _metadataURI, uint256 _editionSize)`: Allows artists to mint new artworks (NFTs) with edition sizes.
 *   - `transferArtwork(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`: Standard ERC721 transfer, but with gallery-specific hooks.
 *   - `burnArtwork(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows artist to burn their own artwork in specific scenarios (e.g., artist choice, legal reasons).
 *   - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`: Retrieves detailed information about an artwork, including artist, metadata, and exhibition status.
 *   - `setArtworkMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string memory _metadataURI)`: Allows artists to update artwork metadata (with gallery approval or governance).
 *
 * **2. Decentralized Curation & Exhibitions:**
 *   - `proposeExhibition(string memory _exhibitionName, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Proposes a new art exhibition with name and time frame.
 *   - `voteForExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, bool _vote)`: Allows gallery token holders to vote on proposed exhibitions (DAO-style curation).
 *   - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Adds an artwork to a specific exhibition if the exhibition is approved and ongoing.
 *   - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Removes an artwork from an exhibition (governance or curator controlled).
 *   - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Manually starts an approved exhibition if not automatically started by time.
 *   - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Manually ends an ongoing exhibition or automatically ends by time.
 *   - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Returns a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *   - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details about a specific exhibition, including artworks and status.
 *
 * **3. Fractional Ownership & Collective Patronage:**
 *   - `fractionalizeArtwork(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _numberOfFractions)`: Allows artwork owners to fractionalize their artwork into ERC20 tokens.
 *   - `purchaseFraction(uint256 _fractionTokenId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows users to purchase fractions of an artwork.
 *   - `redeemFractionForArtwork(uint256 _fractionTokenId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows holders of a majority of fractions to redeem and claim the full artwork (DAO vote or threshold based).
 *
 * **4. Artist Reputation & Staking:**
 *   - `registerArtistProfile(string memory _artistName, string memory _artistBio, string memory _artistWebsite)`: Allows artists to create a profile within the gallery.
 *   - `stakeForArtistReputation(address _artistAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows gallery token holders to stake tokens to boost an artist's reputation score.
 *   - `getArtistReputation(address _artistAddress)`: Retrieves the reputation score of an artist based on staking and other factors (e.g., exhibition participation).
 *   - `withdrawArtistStake(address _artistAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens after a cooldown period.
 *
 * **5. Gallery Governance & Utility Token (Simplified for example):**
 *   - `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Sets the gallery commission fee on artwork sales (governance controlled).
 *   - `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Allows authorized roles to withdraw collected gallery fees for gallery maintenance or artist support.
 *
 * **Advanced Concepts Implemented:**
 *   - **Decentralized Curation:** Community voting for exhibitions, moving beyond centralized selection.
 *   - **Dynamic Exhibitions:** Time-based exhibitions with start/end times, creating a dynamic gallery experience.
 *   - **Fractional Ownership:** Enabling collective ownership of high-value digital art.
 *   - **Artist Reputation System:**  Beyond simple verification, a dynamic reputation system based on community support and activity.
 *   - **Gallery Utility Token (Implied):**  Functions suggest a gallery token for voting, staking, and potentially future utility (not explicitly defined as a full ERC20 for simplicity in this example, but can be extended).
 *
 * **Note:** This is a conceptual smart contract and requires further development, security audits, and gas optimization for a production environment.  It focuses on demonstrating advanced and creative functionalities rather than complete implementation details for every aspect.
