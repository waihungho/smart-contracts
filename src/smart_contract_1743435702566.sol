/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization for Creative Collaboration (DAOCC)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A sophisticated smart contract for fostering creative collaboration within a DAO framework.
 *      This contract implements advanced features beyond standard DAO functionalities, focusing on
 *      reputation-based governance, dynamic project funding, skill-based matching, and decentralized
 *      intellectual property management. It aims to be a comprehensive platform for creative communities.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  `initializeDAO(string _daoName, address _admin)`: Initializes the DAO with a name and sets the initial admin.
 * 2.  `proposeNewMember(address _memberAddress, string _reason)`: Allows existing members to propose new members with a justification.
 * 3.  `voteOnMembershipProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members can vote on pending membership proposals.
 * 4.  `submitSkill(string _skillName, string _skillDescription)`: Members can submit their skills to the DAO's skill registry.
 * 5.  `endorseSkill(address _memberAddress, uint256 _skillId)`: Members can endorse other members for specific skills, building reputation.
 * 6.  `createProjectProposal(string _projectName, string _projectDescription, string[] _requiredSkills, uint256 _fundingGoal)`: Members can propose new creative projects with funding goals and required skills.
 * 7.  `voteOnProjectProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on project proposals.
 * 8.  `fundProject(uint256 _projectId) payable`: Members can contribute funds to approved projects.
 * 9.  `requestProjectMilestone(uint256 _projectId, string _milestoneDescription, uint256 _milestoneCost)`: Project leaders can request funding for specific milestones.
 * 10. `voteOnMilestoneRequest(uint256 _milestoneId, bool _approve)`: Members vote on milestone funding requests.
 * 11. `submitMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _milestoneId, string _completionDetails)`: Project leaders submit proof of milestone completion.
 * 12. `verifyMilestoneCompletion(uint256 _milestoneId, bool _approved)`: Members verify and approve completed milestones, releasing funds.
 * 13. `assignProjectRole(uint256 _projectId, address _memberAddress, string _roleName)`: Project leaders can assign roles to members within a project.
 * 14. `submitContribution(uint256 _projectId, string _contributionDetails)`: Members can submit their contributions to projects for tracking and recognition.
 * 15. `rateContribution(uint256 _contributionId, uint8 _rating, string _feedback)`: Members can rate and provide feedback on contributions, further enhancing reputation.
 * 16. `createLicenseAgreement(uint256 _projectId, string _licenseDetails, address _externalParty)`: DAO can create license agreements for project outputs with external parties (e.g., clients, platforms).
 * 17. `recordIPOwnership(uint256 _projectId, string _ipDescription, address[] _contributors)`: Records on-chain IP ownership for project outputs, attributing to contributors.
 * 18. `disputeContribution(uint256 _contributionId, string _disputeReason)`: Members can dispute contributions if they believe they are unfair or wrongly attributed.
 * 19. `resolveDispute(uint256 _disputeId, DisputeResolution _resolution, string _resolutionDetails)`: Admin or designated dispute resolvers can resolve contribution disputes.
 * 20. `updateDAOParameters(uint256 _quorumPercentage, uint256 _votingDuration)`: Admin can update core DAO parameters like quorum and voting duration.
 * 21. `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Admin can withdraw DAO funds for operational purposes (with transparency and governance in a real-world scenario).
 * 22. `pauseContract()`: Admin function to pause critical contract functionalities in case of emergency.
 * 23. `unpauseContract()`: Admin function to resume contract functionalities after pausing.
