/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Pricing Oracle (DDPO)
 * @author Gemini 
 * @notice This contract implements a decentralized dynamic pricing oracle that allows users to request and receive price feeds based on a customizable exponential moving average (EMA) and a decay factor.  It aims to provide a smoother and more responsive price feed than simple average price oracles by incorporating historical price data with a configurable emphasis on recent price changes.  This could be used in lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, or other DeFi applications requiring a dynamic price feed.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1.  **Price Submission:** Oracles (trusted or incentivized entities) submit raw price data.
 * 2.  **Requesting Price:** Users request the current EMA price, specifying the decay factor and EMA period.
 * 3.  **EMA Calculation:** The contract calculates the EMA based on submitted prices and the provided parameters.
 * 4.  **Decay Factor Tuning:**  An administrator function allows for fine-tuning the global decay factor to optimize performance.
 * 5.  **Price History Limitation:** The contract manages a limited price history to prevent gas cost blow-up over time.
 * 6. **Oracle Management:** Enables adding and removing oracles.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `submitPrice(uint256 _price)`:  Allows authorized oracles to submit a new price.
 * - `requestPrice(uint256 _decayFactor, uint256 _emaPeriod)`: Requests the EMA price based on specified decay factor and EMA period.
 * - `setGlobalDecayFactor(uint256 _newDecayFactor)`: Allows the contract owner to update the global decay factor.
 * - `addOracle(address _oracle)`: Allows the contract owner to add a new authorized oracle.
 * - `removeOracle(address _oracle)`: Allows the contract owner to remove an existing authorized oracle.
 * - `getPriceHistoryLength()`: Returns the current length of the price history.
 * - `getCurrentPrice()`: Returns the current raw price.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **SPDX License Identifier:**  Crucially added the `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` line.  This is *essential* for open-source smart contracts.  It tells other developers under what terms they can use your code.  MIT is a very permissive license.
* **Clear NatSpec Comments:**  Comprehensive NatSpec style comments (`/// @title`, `/// @author`, `/// @notice`, `/// @dev`) explaining the contract's purpose, function inputs/outputs, and important considerations.  This is critical for documentation and automated tools. NatSpec is used by tools like Slither to create human readable documentation of the contract
* **Error Handling:**  Added `require` statements to validate inputs in `submitPrice`, `requestPrice`, and `setGlobalDecayFactor`. This prevents the contract from operating on invalid data, improving security.  `require` statements also provide informative error messages.
* **Oracle Whitelisting:** Implemented an oracle whitelist (`isOracle` mapping and `onlyOracle` modifier). This is *critical* for security.  Only authorized oracles can submit prices, preventing malicious users from manipulating the price feed.  Includes `addOracle` and `removeOracle` functions.
* **Price History Limitation:** Included `maxPriceHistoryLength` and the logic to maintain a limited price history.  This is *essential* to prevent unbounded gas costs as the contract is used over time. The implementation loops through and removes elements from the beginning of the array, this is not the most gas optimized solution, but it is implemented for the sake of simplicity. A more gas optimized solution would be to use linked lists or a circular buffer implementation.
* **EMA Calculation Correctness and Period Limitation:**  The core EMA calculation logic is more robust and uses the `_decayFactor`. The code iterates backwards through the priceHistory, up to the `_emaPeriod` or until the beginning of the price history, calculating the EMA.  This is a more accurate representation of how EMAs are calculated.  Critical `require` statements are in place to check for zero or negative EMA period
* **`onlyOwner` Modifier:** Ensures that sensitive functions like `setGlobalDecayFactor`, `addOracle`, and `removeOracle` can only be called by the contract owner.
* **Events:** Includes `PriceSubmitted`, `DecayFactorUpdated`, `OracleAdded`, and `OracleRemoved` events, allowing external applications to monitor contract activity.
* **Global Decay Factor:**  Allows the owner to adjust the global decay factor for the EMA calculation, providing flexibility to adapt to different market conditions.
* **`getCurrentPrice()` function:** Exposes the current raw price, which can be useful for debugging or monitoring.
* **Struct for Price Entries:** Uses a `PriceEntry` struct to store both the price and the timestamp, allowing for time-weighted calculations in the future if desired.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations (in comments):** Added a comment explaining the O(n) operation in limiting price history and mentioning linked lists or circular buffer implementations.  This shows awareness of gas costs.
* **Clear Code Structure and Naming:** Uses clear variable names and consistent code formatting for readability.

How to Use:

1.  **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the `DecentralizedDynamicPricingOracle` contract to a suitable Ethereum environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Truffle).
2.  **Add Oracles:**  As the contract owner, use the `addOracle()` function to add authorized oracle addresses.
3.  **Submit Prices:** Authorized oracles can then call the `submitPrice()` function to submit price updates.
4.  **Request Prices:** Users can call the `requestPrice()` function, providing the desired `_decayFactor` and `_emaPeriod` to get the current EMA price.
5.  **Tune Decay Factor (Optional):** The contract owner can use the `setGlobalDecayFactor()` function to adjust the decay factor to optimize the price feed's responsiveness.

Important Security Considerations:

*   **Oracle Security:** The security of this oracle relies heavily on the trustworthiness of the oracles.  If oracles are compromised, the price feed can be manipulated.  Consider using a decentralized oracle network or other mechanisms to mitigate oracle risk.
*   **Price History Manipulation:**  While the `maxPriceHistoryLength` limits the history size, malicious oracles could still try to submit a series of strategically chosen prices to influence the EMA.  Robust oracle selection and monitoring are important.
*   **DoS Attacks:**  The contract could be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if an attacker spams the `submitPrice` function, filling up the price history.
*   **Reentrancy:** Although this contract doesn't directly interact with other contracts in a way that makes it vulnerable to reentrancy, always carefully audit for reentrancy issues when integrating with other systems.
*   **Rounding Errors:**  Be mindful of potential rounding errors in the EMA calculation, especially with large numbers.

This improved version addresses the identified weaknesses, provides better security, and offers a more practical and robust implementation of a decentralized dynamic pricing oracle. Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.
