Okay, let's create a smart contract that simulates a "Quantum State Vault". This concept uses analogies from quantum mechanics (superposition, measurement, collapse, entanglement, decoherence) to control access and state transitions, relying on trusted oracles to provide "measurement results" or "entanglement factors". This allows for complex, state-dependent access control and conditional operations.

It's important to note this contract *simulates* these concepts using classical computing and oracles; it does not use actual quantum computing.

We will implement various functions for managing roles, state, access control, funds, and interactions with simulated external factors via oracles, ensuring we have over 20 functions.

**QuantumVault: Outline and Function Summary**

**Outline:**

1.  **Core Concepts:** Simulating quantum state behavior (Superposition, Collapse, Entanglement, Decoherence) to control vault access and operations.
2.  **Roles:** Owner, Guardians, Oracles, Standard Users.
3.  **State Management:** An internal enum tracks the 'simulated quantum state'.
4.  **Superposition:** The vault can be in a state where the final outcome is undetermined (`Superposition`) but has potential weighted outcomes.
5.  **Measurement/Collapse:** Triggered by a specific event or time, requiring input from trusted Oracles to determine the final collapsed state (`Open`, `Closed`, `Locked`, `Decohered`).
6.  **Entanglement:** The state outcome or properties can be influenced by data related to another external entity (e.g., another contract's state), provided by an Oracle.
7.  **Decoherence:** A time-based mechanism that forces the state to collapse to a specific outcome (`Decohered`) if not measured timely.
8.  **State-Dependent Access Control:** Permissions for functions change based on the current `quantumState`.
9.  **Conditional Operations:** Users can schedule operations (like withdrawals) that only execute if the state collapses to a specific outcome.

**Function Summary:**

*   **Initialization & Roles:**
    1.  `constructor`: Deploys contract, sets initial owner and state.
    2.  `addGuardian`: Adds an address to the guardian list (multi-sig style actions).
    3.  `removeGuardian`: Removes an address from the guardian list.
    4.  `addOracle`: Adds an address to the oracle list (submit measurement data).
    5.  `removeOracle`: Removes an address from the oracle list.
    6.  `transferOwnership`: Transfers contract ownership.
*   **Configuration & State Setup:**
    7.  `setSuperpositionStateWeights`: Defines the potential outcomes and their 'simulated probabilities' when in `Superposition`.
    8.  `setAccessControlRule`: Configures which roles can call which functions in each `quantumState`.
    9.  `setEntangledVault`: Links this vault conceptually to another contract address.
    10. `setDecoherenceTime`: Sets the timestamp for automatic state collapse (`Decohered`).
*   **Vault Operations (Funds):**
    11. `deposit`: Allows users to deposit ETH into the vault.
    12. `withdraw`: Allows users to withdraw ETH based on state and access control.
    13. `emergencyWithdraw`: Allows guardians to withdraw funds under specific conditions.
*   **Quantum State Transition (Core Logic):**
    14. `initiateMeasurement`: Starts the measurement process, potentially locking state updates until result submission.
    15. `submitMeasurementResult`: Oracles submit data influencing the state collapse outcome.
    16. `submitEntanglementFactor`: Oracles submit data related to the 'entangled' entity.
    17. `collapseState`: Triggers the final state collapse based on submitted oracle data and internal logic/weights.
    18. `triggerDecoherence`: Forces state collapse to `Decohered` if `decoherenceTime` has passed.
    19. `resetState`: Owner/Guardians can reset the state back to `Superposition` under specific conditions.
*   **Conditional Operations:**
    20. `scheduleConditionalOperation`: Schedules a generic operation (like a specific withdrawal amount) contingent on the state collapsing to a target state.
    21. `executeScheduledOperation`: Executes a scheduled operation if the state has collapsed and matches the target state.
    22. `cancelScheduledOperation`: Allows the scheduler to cancel a pending operation.
*   **Information & Views:**
    23. `getQuantumState`: Returns the current simulated quantum state.
    24. `getSuperpositionWeights`: Returns the current weighted possibilities for state collapse.
    25. `isGuardian`: Checks if an address is a guardian.
    26. `isOracle`: Checks if an address is an oracle.
    27. `getAccessControlRule`: Returns the access rule for a specific function and state.
    28. `getScheduledOperations`: Returns details of pending scheduled operations.
    29. `getMeasurementInputs`: Returns the inputs expected for the next measurement submission (for oracle reference).
    30. `getDecoherenceTime`: Returns the scheduled decoherence timestamp.
    31. `getEntangledVault`: Returns the address of the conceptually entangled vault.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Simulated Quantum State:** The core idea of using enums (`QuantumState`) and transitions (`Superposition`, `Collapse`, `Decoherence`) is the main creative element, mapping abstract physics concepts onto contract states.
2.  **Superposition with Weighted Outcomes:** Storing multiple potential future states with relative `weight` (simulated probability) adds a layer of complexity beyond simple state machines.
3.  **Oracle-Driven State Collapse:** The transition from `Superposition` requires trusted oracles to provide data (`submitMeasurementResult`, `submitEntanglementFactor`) that influences the final determined state (`collapseState`). This simulates the 'measurement problem' where external interaction collapses the quantum state. The oracle role is crucial and represents a common pattern in connecting real-world (or complex off-chain logic) to on-chain state.
4.  **Simulated Entanglement:** The `_entangledVault` and `_currentEntanglementFactor` allow for the state collapse logic to be influenced by factors *external* to this contract, provided by an oracle. This simulates a dependency or correlation akin to quantum entanglement.
5.  **Time-Based Decoherence:** The `_decoherenceTime` and `triggerDecoherence` function introduce a time decay mechanism, forcing a state collapse if measurement doesn't happen within a window. This is an analogy for how quantum states lose coherence over time in the real world.
6.  **State-Dependent Access Control Matrix:** Instead of simple `onlyOwner` or `onlyRole` modifiers, the `_accessControlMatrix` and `canCallFunction` modifier allow defining permissions (`Owner`, `Guardian`, `Oracle`, `User`, `NoAccess`) for *each function* based on the *current `QuantumState`*. This provides a highly dynamic and granular permission system.
7.  **Conditional Operations:** The `scheduleConditionalOperation` and `executeScheduledOperation` pattern allows users to set up future interactions with the vault that are contingent on the outcome of the state collapse. This enables more complex use cases where actions are queued pending a specific vault state.
8.  **Decentralized Oracle Trust:** While simplified (just requiring a count of submissions and a simple hash aggregation), the structure points towards systems where state transitions depend on consensus or aggregation of data from multiple decentralized oracles.

This contract is complex and demonstrates several advanced Solidity patterns and conceptual modeling, moving beyond basic ERC-20 or simple vault examples while avoiding direct copy-pasting of widely available OpenZeppelin patterns (though some fundamental safety practices like checking zero addresses are universal). The "Quantum" theme provides a unique framework for combining these concepts.
