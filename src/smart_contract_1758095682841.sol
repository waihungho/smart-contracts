/**
 * @title AIModelNexus
 * @dev A decentralized marketplace for AI models, enabling fractional ownership,
 * autonomous agent interaction, and a transparent system for data contributions and inference requests.
 *
 * This contract manages the lifecycle of AI Model NFTs (AIMs), their fractionalization into SynapseShares,
 * a market for requesting and fulfilling AI inferences, and a system for rewarding data contributions.
 *
 * Advanced Concepts:
 * - Hybrid On-chain/Off-chain Orchestration: The contract manages on-chain logic (ownership, payments, requests, rewards)
 *   while actual AI model execution (training, inference) is expected to happen off-chain (e.g., via IPFS, decentralized AI compute, oracles).
 *   The contract provides the trust layer and incentive mechanisms.
 * - Custom Fractional Tokenization: A bespoke system for fractional ownership deeply integrated with the AI Model NFT.
 * - Dynamic Reward Accumulator: A gas-efficient, pull-based system for distributing inference rewards to staked fractional share owners.
 * - Role-based Access Control: Beyond simple `onlyOwner`, introducing `onlyModelOwner` and `onlyProtocolFeeRecipient`.
 *
 * Outline:
 * 1.  Core Infrastructure & Access Control
 *     -   Deployment, Pausability, Protocol Fee Management.
 * 2.  AI Model NFT Management (AIMs)
 *     -   Creation, configuration, transfer, and burning of unique AI models represented as NFTs.
 * 3.  Fractional Ownership & Staking (SynapseShares)
 *     -   Tokenization of AIMs into custom fractional shares, buying/selling shares,
 *         and staking shares to earn from model inference usage.
 * 4.  Inference Request Market
 *     -   Users request AI inferences, payments, and off-chain fulfillment.
 * 5.  Data Contribution Marketplace
 *     -   Mechanism for data providers to propose datasets for model improvement and earn rewards.
 * 6.  Reward & Payout System
 *     -   Claiming inference rewards for stakers and data contribution rewards.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * I. Core Infrastructure & Access Control:
 *    - `constructor(address _protocolFeeRecipient, uint16 _protocolFeePercentage)`
 *        Initializes the contract with an admin (deployer), protocol fee recipient, and percentage.
 *    - `pauseContract()`
 *        Allows the admin (Ownable) to pause the contract in emergencies, preventing most operations.
 *    - `unpauseContract()`
 *        Allows the admin (Ownable) to unpause the contract, resuming operations.
 *    - `setProtocolFeeRecipient(address _newRecipient)`
 *        Allows the admin (Ownable) to set a new address to receive protocol fees.
 *    - `setProtocolFeePercentage(uint16 _newPercentage)`
 *        Allows the admin (Ownable) to set a new percentage for protocol fees (0-10000 for 0-100%).
 *    - `withdrawProtocolFees()`
 *        Allows the protocol fee recipient to withdraw accumulated protocol fees.
 *
 * II. AI Model NFT Management (AIMs):
 *    - `createAIModelNFT(string memory _modelURI, uint256 _inferenceCost, uint256 _dataContributionRewardRate)`
 *        Mints a new AI Model NFT, assigning ownership to the caller, and setting initial costs/rates.
 *    - `updateAIModelMetadata(uint256 _modelId, string memory _newModelURI)`
 *        Allows the AI model owner to update its metadata URI (e.g., IPFS hash pointing to model details).
 *    - `updateAIModelConfig(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _newInferenceCost, uint256 _newDataContributionRewardRate, uint256 _newFractionalSharePrice)`
 *        Allows the AI model owner to update its operational parameters: inference cost, data contribution reward rate, and the buy/sell price of fractional shares from the contract.
 *    - `transferAIModelOwnership(address _from, address _to, uint256 _modelId)`
 *        Transfers ownership of an AI Model NFT from one address to another (ERC721-like transfer).
 *    - `burnAIModelNFT(uint256 _modelId)`
 *        Burns an AI Model NFT, provided it's not fractionalized, has no outstanding shares, and no pending inference requests.
 *
 * III. Fractional Ownership & Staking (SynapseShares):
 *    - `tokenizeAIModelForFractionalOwnership(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _totalSharesToMint, uint256 _initialPricePerShare)`
 *        Converts an AI Model NFT into `_totalSharesToMint` fractional shares. All shares are initially minted to the model owner. The model can only be fractionalized once.
 *    - `buyFractionalShare(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _amount)`
 *        Allows users to purchase fractional shares from the contract. ETH is sent to the model owner.
 *    - `sellFractionalShare(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _amount)`
 *        Allows users to sell their fractional shares back to the contract. ETH is paid from the model owner's collected revenue.
 *    - `stakeFractionalShare(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _amount)`
 *        Stakes fractional shares to earn a proportional share of inference rewards generated by the model.
 *    - `unstakeFractionalShare(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _amount)`
 *        Unstakes fractional shares. Triggers a reward update for the unstaker before reducing their staked balance.
 *
 * IV. Inference Request Market:
 *    - `requestInference(uint256 _modelId, string memory _inferenceParamsURI) payable`
 *        Submits a request for an AI model inference, paying the required `inferenceCost`. The payment is held by the contract until fulfillment.
 *    - `submitInferenceResult(uint256 _requestId, string memory _resultURI)`
 *        Allows the AI model owner to submit the result (e.g., IPFS hash of output) for a requested inference. This triggers payment distribution.
 *
 * V. Data Contribution Marketplace:
 *    - `proposeDataContribution(uint256 _modelId, string memory _dataURI, string memory _description)`
 *        Proposes a new dataset for improving an AI model. The `_dataURI` typically points to an off-chain dataset.
 *    - `evaluateDataContribution(uint256 _contributionId, bool _accepted)`
 *        Allows the AI model owner to evaluate and accept or reject a data contribution. If accepted, `dataContributionRewardRate` is locked for the contributor.
 *
 * VI. Reward & Payout System:
 *    - `claimInferenceRewards(uint256 _modelId)`
 *        Allows fractional share stakers to claim their accumulated inference rewards based on their staked amount and the model's performance.
 *    - `claimDataContributionRewards(uint256 _contributionId)`
 *        Allows data contributors to claim rewards for their accepted contributions.

        // Given the constraint of 20+ functions, let's make it direct:

        // For simplicity, let's assume the contract can pay out if it has funds from prior sales/revenue.
        // This implies the contract may accumulate ETH from model owner's sales.
        // A simpler approach: the model owner must fund the contract explicitly for buybacks.
        // Or even simpler: sell is only possible if there is a buyer, this contract is a primary market.
        // Let's make it that the contract manages a pool of shares to sell, and holds a pool of ETH for buybacks.
        // This means the ETH from `buyFractionalShare` should not immediately go to model owner, but stay in the contract.
        // Let's revise `buyFractionalShare` accordingly.

        // Re-evaluating `buyFractionalShare` and `sellFractionalShare` for funding:
        // When shares are bought, funds go to the model owner.
        // When shares are sold, funds must come from the model owner.
        // This implies the contract acts as a market, but the actual funds are exchanged directly between model owner and buyer/seller.
        // This would require the model owner to explicitly approve/send funds or an escrow.
        // Simplest: `model.owner` has an internal balance in the contract for buybacks/sales.

        // To make it work cleanly, model owner funds a 'buyback' balance in the contract.
        // This requires an additional `fundBuybackPool` function for model owners.
        // Or assume `msg.sender` (seller) expects the model owner to have sufficient funds available.
        // Let's just transfer ETH from model owner (if model owner is `msg.sender` for the contract itself) or from a designated pool.

        // A direct transfer from `model.owner` via the contract is problematic because `model.owner` isn't necessarily `msg.sender` for this call.
        // Simplest: The contract itself pays. This means model owner would need to transfer revenue to contract or replenish a buyback pool.
        // Let's assume `model.owner` regularly sends funds to the contract's balance.
        // Or, revenue from inference is partially retained for buybacks.
        // To avoid excessive complexity and extra functions, let's assume the model owner needs to ensure the contract has funds.
        // Funds accumulated from protocol fees or inferences are for distribution, not arbitrary buybacks.

        // New simpler approach: `buyFractionalShare` sends ETH to `model.owner`. `sellFractionalShare` expects `model.owner` to have sent ETH to the contract specifically for buybacks, or `model.owner` to explicitly approve a withdrawal from their balance.
        // Let's create `_modelOwnerETHBalance` to hold model owner funds within the contract.
        // `buyFractionalShare` -> `_modelOwnerETHBalance[model.owner] += msg.value`
        // `sellFractionalShare` -> `_modelOwnerETHBalance[model.owner] -= totalPrice`, then `_msgSender()` receives `totalPrice`.

        // Let's assume the contract directly pays the seller.

                 // This makes `userRewardDebt` act as a checkpoint.

                 // To simplify: `userRewardDebt` can store the "amount owed" or "pending".
                 // This is equivalent to `userUnclaimedRewards`.
                 // Let's use `userUnclaimedRewards` for clarity.

                 // Let's keep the `userRewardDebt` name but adapt its logic to be an accumulator of *earned* rewards.

                 // The logic I implemented in claimInferenceRewards using `userRewardDebt` directly for amount *to be paid* is wrong for the common pattern.

        // The difference `(model.rewardPerShareCumulative * staked) / 1e18` and `userLastUpdatedRewardCheckpoint[_modelId][_user]`
        // This is a standard pattern, let's implement it correctly.

        // Temporarily, let's make `_updateRewardDebt` a no-op for now to re-evaluate the reward system.
        // It's the most complex part to get right with gas efficiency.

        // Re-simplifying the reward logic:
        // `claimInferenceRewards` itself will calculate based on `rewardPerShareCumulative` and `userLastRewardPerShareClaimed`.
        // Staking/unstaking does NOT trigger an update to `userRewardDebt` automatically.
        // It only updates when `claimInferenceRewards` is called.
        // So, `_updateRewardDebt` is not needed for staking/unstaking functions directly.

        // So the current setup:
        // `rewardPerShareCumulative` is a global accumulator for the model.
        // `userRewardDebt[_modelId][_user]` stores the checkpoint of `rewardPerShareCumulative` *for user* at the time of their last action (stake, unstake, claim).
        // This is the standard logic. My initial thought process was correct.
        // `claimInferenceRewards` calculates:
        // `earned = (model.rewardPerShareCumulative - userRewardDebt[_modelId][_user]) * stakedShares / 1e18`
        // This is not correct for `userRewardDebt` to store the checkpoint.

        // Let's revert to a simpler method: `userLastClaimedCumulativeRewardPerShare`.
        // Then: `(model.rewardPerShareCumulative - userLastClaimedCumulativeRewardPerShare) * staked / 1e18`.
        // This is simple and effective.

        // To make `_updateRewardDebt` work for state changes, `userRewardDebt[_modelId][_user]` should store the "value" up to that point.
        // The `userRewardDebt` should actually be `userEarnedRewards` if we want to make it easy.
        // This implies `_updateRewardDebt` is called before any state change to `stakedShares`.

        // Okay, let's implement `_updateRewardDebt` to compute *pending* rewards and add them to a `userPendingClaimableRewards` mapping.
        // This is the cleanest.

        // New mapping needed: `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) public userPendingClaimableRewards;`
        // And `userLastRewardPerShareCheckpoint` to track when debt was last calculated.
        
        // This is getting too complex for a first draft within requested constraints.
        // Let's use the simplest accumulator pattern:
        // `rewardPerShareCumulative`
        // `userRewardDebt` stores a checkpoint of `(stakedShares * rewardPerShareCumulative)`
        // When `claim`:
        //   `currentValue = (stakedShares * rewardPerShareCumulative) / 1e18`
        //   `earned = currentValue - userRewardDebt`
        //   `userRewardDebt = currentValue`
        //   `transfer(earned)`
        // This is a correct implementation of the "debt" pattern.
        // So, `_updateRewardDebt` needs to be called on stake, unstake, and claim to adjust the checkpoint.

        // Update the user's reward debt based on their current staked shares and the model's rewardPerShareCumulative
        // This function effectively "snapshot" a user's earned rewards up to this point.
        uint256 staked = modelStakedFractionalShares[_modelId][_user];
