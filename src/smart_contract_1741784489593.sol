/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Advanced Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery with advanced features.
 *
 * **Outline & Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Art Piece Management:**
 *    - `mintArtPiece(string _metadataURI, address _artist, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Allows artists to mint new art pieces as NFTs with metadata URI and royalty settings.
 *    - `transferArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId, address _to)`:  Standard NFT transfer function with royalty enforcement.
 *    - `updateArtMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, string _newMetadataURI)`:  Allows artists to update the metadata URI of their art piece (within limits, potentially with gallery approval).
 *    - `setArtPrice(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _price)`: Allows the current owner to set a sale price for an art piece.
 *    - `buyArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId)`:  Allows anyone to buy an art piece listed for sale, enforcing royalties.
 *    - `burnArtPiece(uint256 _tokenId)`:  Allows the original artist to burn their art piece under specific conditions (e.g., if it's plagiarized or they want to revoke it).
 *    - `getArtPieceDetails(uint256 _tokenId)`:  Returns detailed information about an art piece (metadata, artist, owner, price, royalty, etc.).
 *
 * **2. Exhibition Management:**
 *    - `createExhibition(string _exhibitionName, string _description, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime, address[] _curators)`:  Allows gallery owners to create exhibitions with names, descriptions, timeframes, and assigned curators.
 *    - `addArtToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`:  Allows curators to add art pieces to an exhibition (potentially with artist approval or curation voting).
 *    - `removeArtFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows curators to remove art pieces from an exhibition.
 *    - `startExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`:  Allows gallery owners or designated roles to start an exhibition, making it visible and active.
 *    - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`:  Ends an exhibition, potentially triggering actions like curator rewards or data analysis.
 *    - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Returns detailed information about an exhibition (name, description, time frame, curators, art pieces, etc.).
 *    - `getActiveExhibitions()`: Returns a list of currently active exhibitions.
 *
 * **3. Curation & Governance (Simplified DAO elements):**
 *    - `requestCuration(uint256 _tokenId)`: Allows artists to request curation for their art piece to be featured in exhibitions (requires voting or curator approval).
 *    - `voteOnCurationRequest(uint256 _requestId, bool _approve)`:  Allows curators or community members to vote on curation requests.
 *    - `submitGalleryProposal(string _proposalDescription)`:  Allows community members to submit proposals for gallery improvements, rule changes, etc.
 *    - `voteOnGalleryProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Allows community members to vote on gallery proposals.
 *    - `executeGalleryProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`:  Executes a successful gallery proposal (potentially requires a quorum and owner approval for critical changes).
 *
 * **4. Community & Social Features:**
 *    - `postCommentOnArt(uint256 _tokenId, string _comment)`: Allows users to post comments on art pieces (basic social interaction within the gallery).
 *    - `getArtComments(uint256 _tokenId)`: Returns a list of comments for a specific art piece.
 *
 * **5. Utility & Admin Functions:**
 *    - `setGalleryFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`:  Allows the gallery owner to set a fee percentage on art sales.
 *    - `withdrawGalleryFees()`: Allows the gallery owner to withdraw accumulated gallery fees.
 *    - `emergencyPause()`:  A circuit breaker function for the gallery owner to pause critical functionalities in case of emergencies.
 *    - `emergencyUnpause()`:  Resumes paused functionalities.
 *    - `setCuratorFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Allows the gallery owner to set a fee percentage for curators on art sales within exhibitions they curate.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Trendy Features:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Elements (Simplified DAO):**
    *   **Curation Requests & Voting:** Artists can request curation for their work, and a voting mechanism (simplified in this example, could be expanded to token-weighted voting) allows the community or curators to influence which art gets featured.
    *   **Gallery Proposals & Governance:**  The `submitGalleryProposal`, `voteOnGalleryProposal`, and `executeGalleryProposal` functions introduce a basic governance layer. Community members can propose changes to the gallery, vote on them, and the owner (or a DAO in a more advanced version) can execute approved proposals. This moves towards decentralized decision-making, a core concept of DAOs.

2.  **Dynamic Royalties and Artist Empowerment:**
    *   **Customizable Royalties:** Artists can set their own royalty percentages when minting, ensuring they earn from secondary market sales.
    *   **Artist-Controlled Metadata Updates:**  While potentially restricted, allowing artists to update metadata gives them more control over their creations.
    *   **Burn Function (Artist Revocation):**  The `burnArtPiece` function, under specific conditions, could be used by artists to revoke or remove their art, offering a level of control not always present in NFT platforms.

3.  **Exhibition and Curation Features:**
    *   **Exhibition Management:** The contract allows for the creation, scheduling, and curation of digital art exhibitions, mimicking real-world gallery experiences in a decentralized manner.
    *   **Curator Roles:**  Defining curators and assigning them to exhibitions adds a layer of expertise and community involvement in selecting and showcasing art. Curator fees are also included to incentivize curation.

4.  **Community and Social Interaction:**
    *   **Art Piece Comments:** The `postCommentOnArt` and `getArtComments` functions introduce basic social features, enabling users to interact and discuss art directly on the blockchain platform.

5.  **Advanced Functionality & Security:**
    *   **Emergency Pause/Unpause:**  A "circuit breaker" mechanism (`emergencyPause`, `emergencyUnpause`) is included for the gallery owner to temporarily halt critical functions in case of security issues or emergencies, a crucial feature for responsible smart contract ownership.
    *   **Explicit Owner Mapping:** Instead of relying solely on ERC721's `ownerOf`, an explicit `artPieceOwners` mapping is used for potentially more fine-grained control and easier access to owner information within the contract.
    *   **Curator Fees:**  The implementation of curator fees adds a layer of economic incentive for curators and promotes a more robust and engaged curation ecosystem.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Gas Optimization:**  For a production-level contract with this many functions, gas optimization would be crucial. Techniques like using `calldata` where appropriate, efficient data structures, and careful loop management would be necessary.
*   **Security Audits:**  A contract of this complexity would require thorough security audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
*   **Scalability:**  Considerations for scalability might be needed if the gallery is expected to handle a very large number of art pieces, exhibitions, and users. Layer-2 solutions or other scaling techniques could be explored.
*   **Off-Chain Infrastructure:**  For a full art gallery platform, you would need significant off-chain infrastructure for:
    *   Metadata storage (IPFS or decentralized storage).
    *   A user interface for interacting with the contract.
    *   Potentially, more sophisticated voting and governance mechanisms.
    *   Indexing and searching art pieces and exhibitions.
*   **Community Governance (Further Development):** The governance aspects in this contract are simplified. A fully realized decentralized autonomous art gallery might implement a more robust DAO structure with token-based voting, delegation, and more complex proposal execution mechanisms.

This contract provides a foundation for a feature-rich and innovative decentralized art gallery, showcasing a range of advanced concepts and trendy features within the Solidity smart contract space. Remember that this is a conceptual example and would need further refinement, testing, and security considerations for real-world deployment.
