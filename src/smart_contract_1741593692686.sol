/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (Example - Highly Conceptual and for Demonstration)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective, enabling artists to submit,
 * curate, and fractionalize digital art, governed by a community DAO. This contract incorporates
 * advanced concepts like dynamic NFT metadata, decentralized curation, fractional ownership,
 * community-driven royalties, and reputation-based governance.
 *
 * **Outline and Function Summary:**
 *
 * **1. Art Submission and Curation:**
 *    - `submitArtProposal(string memory _ipfsHash, string memory _title, string memory _description)`: Artists submit art proposals with IPFS hash, title, and description.
 *    - `voteOnArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _approve)`: Staked users vote on art proposals.
 *    - `getArtProposalStatus(uint256 _proposalId)`: View the status (pending, approved, rejected) of an art proposal.
 *    - `getTotalArtProposals()`: Get the total number of art proposals submitted.
 *    - `getApprovedArtworks()`: Get a list of IDs of approved artworks.
 *
 * **2. NFT Minting and Management:**
 *    - `mintArtNFT(uint256 _proposalId)`: (Internal) Mints an NFT for an approved art proposal, triggered by proposal approval.
 *    - `getArtNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieve the NFT contract address for a specific artwork ID.
 *    - `setDynamicNFTMetadata(uint256 _artworkId, string memory _newMetadata)`: Allows curators to update NFT metadata dynamically (e.g., based on community feedback).
 *    - `transferArtNFT(uint256 _artworkId, address _to)`: Allows NFT owners to transfer their artwork NFTs.
 *
 * **3. Fractional Ownership and Trading:**
 *    - `fractionalizeArtNFT(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionCount)`: Allows artwork NFT owners to fractionalize their NFT into ERC1155 tokens.
 *    - `buyFractionalArtNFT(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Allows users to buy fractional ownership of an artwork.
 *    - `sellFractionalArtNFT(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _fractionAmount)`: Allows users to sell fractional ownership of an artwork.
 *    - `getRedeemableNFT(uint256 _artworkId)`: Get the ERC1155 contract address for fractional ownership of an artwork.
 *
 * **4. DAO Governance and Community Features:**
 *    - `stakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Users stake governance tokens to participate in voting and curation.
 *    - `unstakeTokens(uint256 _amount)`: Users unstake their governance tokens.
 *    - `createGovernanceProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _calldata)`: Staked users create governance proposals for DAO operations.
 *    - `voteOnGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: Staked users vote on governance proposals.
 *    - `executeGovernanceProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a passed governance proposal.
 *    - `setCuratorRole(address _curator, bool _isCurator)`: Governance function to assign/revoke curator roles for metadata updates and collection management.
 *    - `getCurators()`: View the list of current curators.
 *
 * **5. Royalty and Revenue Distribution:**
 *    - `setArtworkRoyalty(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _royaltyPercentage)`: Curators set royalty percentage for secondary sales of artworks.
 *    - `distributeRoyalties(uint256 _artworkId)`: (Internal) Distributes royalties to the original artist and fractional owners upon secondary sales.
 *    - `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Owner/Governance function to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *
 * **6. Reputation System (Conceptual - can be expanded):**
 *    - `reportArtProposal(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _reportReason)`: Users can report art proposals for potential violations (spam, plagiarism). (Conceptual - reputation impact not fully implemented here).
 *    - `getUserReputation(address _user)`: (Conceptual) Placeholder for a function to retrieve user reputation score (can be based on voting participation, proposal quality, etc.).

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Creative Features:**

1.  **Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) Theme:** The contract is designed around a DAAC, representing a trendy and relevant use case for blockchain in the art world.

2.  **Art Submission and Curation via DAO:**
    *   Artists submit art proposals, moving away from centralized curation.
    *   Staked community members vote on proposals, implementing decentralized curation.
    *   This shifts power to the community in deciding what art is accepted into the collective.

3.  **Dynamic NFT Metadata:**
    *   Curators (or potentially governance proposals) can update NFT metadata *after* minting.
    *   This allows for evolving art based on community feedback, collaborations, or external events, making NFTs more interactive and less static.

4.  **Fractional Ownership of Art NFTs:**
    *   Artwork NFTs can be fractionalized into ERC1155 tokens.
    *   This democratizes access to high-value digital art, allowing broader community participation and investment.
    *   Fractional ownership enables new forms of art investment, trading, and community governance of shared assets.

5.  **Community-Driven Royalties:**
    *   Royalties on secondary sales are implemented and can potentially be governed by the DAO.
    *   Royalties can be distributed not just to the original artist but also to fractional owners, creating shared revenue streams within the collective.

6.  **Reputation System (Conceptual):**
    *   A basic framework for a reputation system is included (though not fully implemented in detail).
    *   Reputation could be used to influence voting power, curation rights, or access to certain features within the DAAC, fostering a more meritocratic and engaged community.

7.  **Governance Proposals for Contract Parameters and Actions:**
    *   The DAO can govern various aspects of the contract through governance proposals.
    *   This includes setting curators, adjusting voting quorums, changing platform fees, and potentially even upgrading contract logic (using proxy patterns in a real advanced implementation).

8.  **Staking for Governance Participation:**
    *   Users must stake governance tokens to participate in voting and curation, aligning incentives and ensuring that governance is driven by committed community members.

9.  **Curator Roles:**
    *   Curators are introduced as a role to manage certain aspects like dynamic metadata updates and potentially collection management.
    *   Curators are appointed through governance, providing a layer of authorized management within the DAO structure.

10. **Platform Fees for Sustainability:**
    *   A platform fee mechanism is included to collect a percentage of secondary sales, providing a potential revenue stream for the DAAC's ongoing development and operation.

11. **Event Emission for Transparency:**
    *   Extensive use of events ensures transparency and auditability of all key actions within the contract, crucial for a decentralized and community-governed system.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Conceptual and Simplified:** This contract is highly conceptual and simplified for demonstration purposes. A production-ready DAAC smart contract would require significantly more development, security audits, and potentially integration with external services (e.g., IPFS pinning services, NFT marketplaces, advanced governance frameworks).
*   **NFT and Fractional NFT Implementation:** The NFT and fractional NFT minting and management are simplified placeholders. In a real application, you would need to deploy actual NFT contracts (ERC721 and ERC1155), likely using factory patterns for each artwork or fractionalized collection.
*   **Governance Token Integration:** The contract assumes the existence of a separate governance token contract. You would need to deploy and integrate a real ERC20 governance token and implement token transfer and balance checking logic.
*   **Security Considerations:**  This example code is not audited and should not be used in production without thorough security review. Smart contracts managing digital assets require rigorous security practices.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Gas optimization is not a primary focus in this example for clarity. In a real-world deployment, gas efficiency would be a crucial consideration.
*   **Scalability and Real-World Deployment:**  Deploying a complex DAAC like this in a real-world scenario would require careful consideration of scalability, user experience, and long-term governance models.

This example demonstrates a range of advanced and creative concepts that can be implemented in a Solidity smart contract, going beyond basic token transfers and simple DAOs to create a more sophisticated and community-driven decentralized application within the art and NFT space.
