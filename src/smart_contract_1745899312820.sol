Okay, let's design a complex, feature-rich smart contract focusing on dynamic governance, asset fractionalization, and a unique staking/revenue distribution model.

This contract will simulate a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that acquires and manages high-value digital assets (like NFTs), fractionalizes them, and distributes revenue to participants based on their governance token holdings and staked utility tokens. The DAO parameters will be dynamically adjustable via governance proposals.

We will need more than 20 functions to cover:
1.  Core DAO Governance (Proposal creation, voting, execution)
2.  Dynamic Parameter Management
3.  Asset Management (Inclusion, Fractionalization, Sale)
4.  Fractional Asset Management (Selling fractions, Buyout proposals)
5.  Treasury Management
6.  Staking and Revenue Distribution
7.  Utility/Helper Functions

Since we cannot duplicate open-source *code*, we will design the logic from scratch, though we will use standard interfaces like `IERC20`, `IERC721`, and simulate ERC1155 behavior internally for the fractions to keep the example in a single contract.

**Function Summary (Targeting >20 functions):**

1.  `initialize(address govTokenAddr, address utilityTokenAddr, address treasuryAddr, Parameters initialParams)`: Sets initial addresses and DAO parameters. Callable only once.
2.  `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Delegates voting power of the GovToken (simulated).
3.  `getVotingPower(address account)`: Calculates current voting power (GovToken balance + Utility stake bonus). View function.
4.  `stakeUtilityToken(uint256 amount)`: Stakes Utility Tokens to gain boosted voting power and revenue share.
5.  `unstakeUtilityToken(uint256 amount)`: Unstakes Utility Tokens.
6.  `proposeAssetInclusion(address nftAddress, uint256 nftTokenId, string memory assetName, uint256 initialFractionPrice)`: Creates a proposal to acquire and fractionalize an NFT. Requires a GovToken stake.
7.  `proposeParamChange(Parameters memory newParams)`: Creates a proposal to change DAO parameters. Requires GovToken stake.
8.  `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Creates a proposal to withdraw funds from the treasury. Requires GovToken stake.
9.  `proposeBuyoutOffer(uint256 assetId, uint256 totalBuyoutAmount)`: Creates a proposal for someone to buy all fractions of an asset to redeem the underlying NFT.
10. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support)`: Casts a vote (Yay/Nay/Abstain) on an active proposal. Support is an enum (0=Nay, 1=Yay, 2=Abstain).
11. `queueProposalForExecution(uint256 proposalId)`: Moves a successful proposal to the execution queue after its voting period ends.
12. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a proposal that has passed and is in the queue. Contains logic for different proposal types.
13. `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows the proposer or authorized address to cancel a proposal before voting starts.
14. `fractionalizeNFT(uint256 proposalId)`: Internal function called by `executeProposal` (if type is ASSET_INCLUSION). Transfers NFT, mints simulated ERC1155 fractions, updates asset state.
15. `sellFractions(uint256 assetId, uint256 amount)`: Allows purchasing fractions of a fractionalized asset. Handles payment, fees, and fraction transfer (simulated).
16. `transferFractions(uint256 assetId, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Simulates ERC1155 transfer for asset fractions. Requires approval or sender is owner.
17. `balanceOfFractions(uint256 assetId, address account)`: Returns the simulated balance of fractions for a given asset and account. View function.
18. `claimRevenueShare()`: Allows stakers of Utility Tokens or holders of fractions to claim their accrued revenue share from fees.
19. `updateAssetFractionPrice(uint256 assetId, uint256 newPrice)`: Callable *only* via a successful governance proposal (type ASSET_SALE or similar, or maybe a separate PRICE_CHANGE proposal type).
20. `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Queued, Expired, Executed). View function.
21. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns detailed information about a proposal. View function.
22. `getCurrentParameters()`: Returns the current active DAO parameters. View function.
23. `getAssetDetails(uint256 assetId)`: Returns details about a fractionalized asset. View function.
24. `getTreasuryBalance(address token)`: Returns the balance of a specific token in the DAO treasury contract. View function.
25. `pauseDAOActivity()`: Emergency function to pause core activities (proposals, voting, execution, staking, selling). Requires a specific role or high voting threshold.
26. `unpauseDAOActivity()`: Unpauses DAO activity. Requires same high threshold/role.
27. `updateGovTokenAddress(address newGovTokenAddr)`: Callable *only* via governance proposal. Allows upgrading the GovToken contract address the DAO interacts with.
28. `updateUtilityTokenAddress(address newUtilityTokenAddr)`: Callable *only* via governance proposal. Allows upgrading the UtilityToken contract address.

This list provides 28 distinct functions covering the proposed dynamic and fractionalized DAO concepts, exceeding the 20-function requirement and avoiding direct copy-pasting of standard library implementations (by simulating some logic internally).

        // 50% goes to DAO treasury (as ETH balance).
        // 50% is distributed to `accruedRevenue` mapping for *current* Utility Stakers proportionally. Still needs total stake.

        // Okay, let's implement claimRevenueShare based on accruedRevenue[msg.sender].
        // How does accruedRevenue[msg.sender] get populated?
        // 1. From fraction sale fees: A percentage of the fee is added to stakers' accruedRevenue based on their stake proportion at that moment (still needs total stake).
        // 2. From asset sale revenue: A percentage of the sale price is added to fraction holders' accruedRevenue based on fraction proportion at that moment (still needs total fractions).

        // This on-chain calculation and proportional distribution at the time of revenue generation is expensive and complex.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts & Creativity:**

1.  **Dynamic Parameters:** The `Parameters` struct and `proposeParamChange`/`_handleParamChange` functions allow core DAO rules (voting period, quorum, fees, etc.) to be adjusted via governance, making the DAO adaptable without contract upgrades (for these specific parameters).
2.  **Multi-Token Staking & Boosted Voting Power:** The contract uses a separate `utilityToken` alongside the `govToken`. Staking the utility token (`stakeUtilityToken`) grants a *boost* to voting power (`getVotingPower`), making participation more nuanced than just holding the governance token. It also links Utility stake to potential revenue share (`claimRevenueShare`, though simplified).
3.  **Asset Fractionalization (Simulated):** The core concept of taking a high-value NFT (`_handleAssetInclusion`) and representing ownership via simulated ERC-1155-like fractions (`_fractionBalance`, `transferFractions`, `balanceOfFractions`). This creates liquid, divisible ownership of indivisible assets within the DAO framework.
4.  **Multiple Proposal Types:** The `ProposalType` enum and the central `executeProposal` function handle distinct governance actions (asset inclusion, parameter change, treasury withdrawal, asset sale, buyout offers), providing a structured way for the DAO to manage various operations.
5.  **Buyout Mechanism:** The `proposeBuyoutOffer` and `_handleBuyoutExecution` functions outline a mechanism for external parties (or the DAO itself) to propose buying the *entire* fractionalized asset, triggering a potential distribution of the buyout amount to fraction holders. (The execution logic is simplified but shows the concept).
6.  **Revenue Distribution (Simplified):** The `accruedRevenue` mapping and `claimRevenueShare`/`manuallyAccrueRevenue` functions demonstrate a basic model for collecting fees/revenue (from fraction sales in `sellFractions`) and allowing participants (utility stakers in this simplified version) to claim their share. Acknowledged complexities exist in fair distribution.
7.  **Simulated Internal Token Logic:** Instead of relying on external ERC-20/ERC-1155 implementations for GovToken, UtilityToken staking, and Asset Fractions, some core mechanics (`_getGovTokenBalance`, `_transferGovTokens`, `utilityStake`, `_fractionBalance`, `_mintFractions`, `_burnFractions`, `transferFractions`, `balanceOfFractions`) are simulated internally. While not production-ready, this avoids direct duplication of standard library contracts and demonstrates the core logic within a single contract.
8.  **Queued Execution:** Proposals don't execute immediately after succeeding. They enter a `QUEUED` state and require a separate `executeProposal` call, respecting an `executionDelay` and `executionGracePeriod`. This allows time for review or reaction before sensitive actions occur.
9.  **Emergency Pause:** Includes a basic `pauseDAOActivity` mechanism (controlled by an initializer-set address for this example) to halt core operations in emergencies.
10. **Upgradeable Token Addresses (via Governance):** Functions like `updateGovTokenAddress` demonstrate how the DAO could potentially update the addresses of external token contracts it interacts with, allowing for token upgrades controlled by governance.

This contract combines elements of DAO governance, DeFi (staking, potential yield from assets), and asset management/fractionalization in a single system with dynamic, governance-controlled parameters, hitting the requirements for complexity, creativity, and function count without directly duplicating common open-source contract templates.
