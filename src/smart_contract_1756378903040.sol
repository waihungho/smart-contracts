This smart contract, **ElysiumGovernor**, implements an advanced and adaptive Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance system. It integrates cutting-edge concepts like AI oracle feedback for dynamic parameter adjustments, a reputation-based influence system, and robust treasury management. The goal is to create a more resilient, responsive, and self-optimizing decentralized governance model that can adapt to changing circumstances and proposal characteristics.

## ElysiumGovernor Smart Contract

**Concept:** **Adaptive Governance & Dynamic Capital Allocation**

The ElysiumGovernor aims to revolutionize DAO governance by making it more intelligent and adaptive. It achieves this through:
1.  **AI Oracle Integration:** Leverages an external (off-chain) AI oracle to provide sentiment and risk analysis for submitted proposals. This analysis directly influences governance parameters.
2.  **Dynamic Governance Parameters:** The quorum required for a proposal to pass and its voting period can dynamically adjust based on the AI oracle's sentiment and risk scores. For instance, high-risk proposals might require a higher quorum and longer deliberation.
3.  **Reputation-Based Influence:** Participants earn "Influence Points" for constructive engagement (e.g., submitting successful proposals, consistent positive voting). These points amplify their voting power, rewarding valuable contributions.
4.  **Treasury Management:** Provides a secure and transparent way for the DAO to manage its assets, allowing for governance-approved withdrawals and deposits.
5.  **Standard DAO Lifecycle:** Maintains core proposal submission, voting, queuing, and execution functionalities, with added layers of intelligence.

### Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `ElysiumGovernor`

This contract implements an adaptive DAO governor system, integrating AI oracle feedback for dynamic parameter adjustments, a reputation-based influence system, and robust treasury management. It aims for a more resilient and responsive decentralized governance model.

**I. Core Governance & Proposal Lifecycle**
1.  `submitProposal(address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory values, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory descriptionURI)`: Allows members to submit a new governance proposal specifying target contracts, ETH values, calldatas for function calls, and a URI for detailed description.
2.  `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns the current state of a proposal (Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Queued, Expired, Executed).
3.  `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, string calldata reason)`: Allows members to cast a vote (0: Against, 1: For, 2: Abstain) on an active proposal, with an optional reason. Voting power is dynamic.
4.  `queueProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Transitions a successful proposal into the execution queue after its voting period ends, setting its execution timestamp.
5.  `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a queued proposal, triggering its target functions, after its minimum execution delay has passed.
6.  `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Allows the proposer (under specific conditions) or emergency admins to cancel a proposal before it succeeds.

**II. Token Staking & Voting Power (Interacts with an `IERC20Votes` InfluenceToken)**
7.  `stakeTokens(uint256 amount)`: Users stake `InfluenceToken` to transfer them to the contract, gaining voting power and participation rights.
8.  `unstakeTokens(uint256 amount)`: Users unstake their `InfluenceToken` from the contract, transferring them back to their wallet and losing associated voting power.
9.  `delegate(address delegatee)`: Delegates the caller's voting power (derived from staked tokens) to another address. This interacts directly with the `IERC20Votes` token.
10. `undelegate()`: Revokes any existing delegation, effectively delegating voting power back to the caller.
11. `getVotingPower(address account, uint256 blockNumber)`: Returns the total effective voting power of an account at a specific block, combining base votes from staked tokens and influence points.

**III. Influence & Reputation System**
12. `updateInfluencePoints(address user, int256 change)`: (Admin-controlled) Adjusts a user's influence points. This function is designed to be called by a trusted system (e.g., an off-chain reputation service, or via a successful governance proposal) to reward positive contributions.
13. `getInfluencePoints(address account)`: Retrieves the current influence points of a given account.

**IV. AI Oracle & Adaptive Parameters**
14. `setAIOracleAddress(address newOracle)`: Sets the trusted address of the AI Oracle contract. Only callable by the owner (or via governance).
15. `receiveAIAnalysis(uint256 proposalId, int256 sentimentScore, uint256 riskScore, string calldata analysisURI)`: A callback function, callable only by the designated AI Oracle, to provide sentiment and risk analysis for a proposal. This data then dynamically adjusts the proposal's quorum and voting period.
16. `getDynamicQuorumRequired(uint256 proposalId)`: Calculates and returns the quorum percentage required for a specific proposal to pass, potentially adjusted by AI sentiment/risk.
17. `getDynamicVotingPeriod(uint256 proposalId)`: Calculates and returns the voting period (in blocks) for a specific proposal, potentially adjusted by AI sentiment/risk.

**V. Treasury Management**
18. `depositToTreasury(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Allows anyone to deposit ERC20 tokens into the DAO's treasury.
19. `proposeTreasuryWithdrawal(address tokenAddress, address recipient, uint256 amount, string memory descriptionURI)`: Submits a new governance proposal specifically for withdrawing a specified amount of a token from the treasury to a recipient.
20. `getTreasuryBalance(address tokenAddress)`: Returns the balance of a specific ERC20 token (or native ETH if `address(0)` is used) held by the DAO treasury.

**VI. Emergency & Admin Controls**
21. `setEmergencyAdmin(address admin, bool authorized)`: Grants or revokes emergency admin status to an address. Emergency admins can pause the contract or cancel malicious proposals.
22. `pause()`: Pauses core contract functions, such as proposal submission and voting, during an emergency. Callable by emergency admins.
23. `unpause()`: Unpauses the contract, resuming normal operations. Callable by emergency admins.
