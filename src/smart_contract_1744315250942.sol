 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG) - Smart Contract
 * @author Gemini AI Assistant
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery, enabling artists to showcase,
 * sell, and manage their digital art as NFTs, governed by a community DAO.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *
 * **Artist Management:**
 * 1. registerArtist(): Allows artists to register with the gallery.
 * 2. approveArtist(address _artist): Gallery owner function to approve registered artists.
 * 3. revokeArtistApproval(address _artist): Gallery owner function to revoke artist approval.
 * 4. isApprovedArtist(address _artist): View function to check if an address is an approved artist.
 *
 * **Artwork Management:**
 * 5. mintArtwork(string memory _artworkURI, uint256 _price): Artists mint new artworks as NFTs.
 * 6. setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice): Artists can change the price of their artworks.
 * 7. transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner): Artists can transfer ownership of unsold artworks.
 * 8. burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Artists can burn their unsold artworks (destroys NFT).
 * 9. getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId): View function to retrieve details of a specific artwork.
 * 10. getArtistArtworks(address _artist): View function to get a list of artwork IDs by an artist.
 * 11. getRandomArtworkId(): View function to get a random artwork ID from the gallery.
 *
 * **Gallery Functionality:**
 * 12. purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId): Users can purchase artworks listed in the gallery.
 * 13. withdrawGalleryFunds(): Gallery owner function to withdraw accumulated funds from sales.
 * 14. setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage): Gallery owner function to set the platform fee percentage.
 * 15. getPlatformFee(): View function to get the current platform fee percentage.
 * 16. setBaseURI(string memory _baseURI): Gallery owner function to set the base URI for artwork metadata.
 * 17. getBaseURI(): View function to retrieve the current base URI.
 *
 * **Community/DAO Features (Advanced Concepts):**
 * 18. proposeFeature(string memory _proposalDescription): Artists and approved token holders can propose new gallery features.
 * 19. voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote): Approved token holders can vote on feature proposals.
 * 20. executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId): Gallery owner function to execute approved feature proposals.
 * 21. emergencyShutdown(): Gallery owner function to temporarily halt new sales and minting in case of critical issues.
 * 22. resumeOperations(): Gallery owner function to resume normal gallery operations after shutdown.
 * 23. setGovernanceToken(address _tokenAddress): Gallery owner function to set the governance token address for DAO features.
 * 24. getGovernanceToken(): View function to retrieve the governance token address.
