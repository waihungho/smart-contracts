Okay, let's design an advanced, creative, and trendy smart contract. A concept that blends DeFi, governance, and conditional logic could be a "Conditional Strategy Vault" where users deposit funds, and these funds become accessible or managed based on complex, multi-factor conditions defined within strategies, potentially influenced by external data or governance decisions.

We'll call it `ConStraVault`.

**Core Concept:** Users deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault, linking their deposit to a specific "Strategy". A Strategy is a set of one or more "Conditions". Funds locked in a deposit can only be withdrawn when *all* Conditions linked to the associated Strategy are met. Strategists create strategies, and Governors manage global settings and approve/manage strategies/conditions. An Oracle address provides external data signals.

**Advanced/Creative Aspects:**
*   **Multi-Condition Logic:** Withdrawals depend on satisfying *multiple* arbitrary conditions simultaneously.
*   **Dynamic Conditions:** Conditions can be time-based, rely on external oracle data (simulated), or require manual signaling.
*   **Strategy-Based Access Control:** User funds are tied to specific strategies, not just global rules.
*   **Role-Based Governance:** Separate roles for Strategists (creating complex logic) and Governors (approving, setting fees, emergency actions).
*   **Conditional Deposit Transfer:** Allowing users to transfer their *locked* deposit positions under specific circumstances.
*   **Emergency Break Glass:** Governance override for critical situations.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(address _oracle, address _governor)`: Deploys the contract, setting the initial oracle and governor addresses.
*   `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: Governor sets the address of the trusted oracle for external data.
*   `addStrategist(address _strategist)`: Governor grants the Strategist role.
*   `removeStrategist(address _strategist)`: Governor revokes the Strategist role.
*   `addGovernor(address _governor)`: Governor grants the Governor role.
*   `removeGovernor(address _governor)`: Governor revokes the Governor role (cannot remove self).
*   `transferGovernorship(address _newGovernor)`: Transfers the *sole* governorship to a new address. Requires current sole governor consent.
*   `createCondition(ConditionType _type, uint256 _value, address _targetAddress, bytes memory _data)`: Strategist creates a new condition with specific parameters (type, target value/address, optional data).
*   `updateCondition(uint256 _conditionId, uint256 _value, address _targetAddress, bytes memory _data)`: Strategist updates a condition *if* it hasn't been used in an active strategy or isn't met.
*   `signalExternalConditionMet(uint256 _conditionId, bool _isMet)`: Oracle signals the status of an `EXTERNAL_SIGNAL` type condition.
*   `createStrategy(uint256[] memory _conditionIds, address[] memory _allowedTokens, string memory _metadataUri)`: Strategist creates a strategy, linking existing conditions and specifying allowed deposit tokens. Status is PENDING.
*   `activateStrategy(uint256 _strategyId)`: Governor approves and activates a PENDING strategy.
*   `pauseStrategy(uint256 _strategyId)`: Governor pauses an ACTIVE strategy (deposits cannot be made, withdrawals might be affected depending on conditions).
*   `cancelStrategy(uint256 _strategyId)`: Governor cancels a strategy (no new deposits; impact on existing deposits needs clarification - in this design, they stay locked unless conditions eventually met or emergency exit).
*   `updateStrategyMetadata(uint256 _strategyId, string memory _metadataUri)`: Strategist updates strategy metadata URI.
*   `addTokensToStrategy(uint256 _strategyId, address[] memory _newTokens)`: Governor adds more allowed deposit tokens to a strategy.
*   `deposit(address _token, uint256 _amount, uint256 _strategyId)`: User deposits ERC20 tokens, linking them to an ACTIVE strategy. Requires prior ERC20 approve.
*   `withdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount)`: User attempts to withdraw their deposit of a specific token. Only succeeds if *all* conditions of the linked strategy are met. Applies withdrawal fee.
*   `emergencyWithdraw(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _to)`: Governor can withdraw *any* amount of a specific token from the vault to a specified address, bypassing all conditions.
*   `transferDeposit(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _to)`: User transfers a portion or all of their *locked* deposit position for a specific token to another user. The transferred deposit remains subject to the original strategy's conditions.
*   `setWithdrawalFeePercentage(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Governor sets the percentage fee (basis points, e.g., 100 = 1%) applied to successful withdrawals.
*   `canWithdraw(address _user, address _token)`: View function. Checks if a user's deposit for a token meets all strategy conditions and is currently withdrawable.
*   `getUserDeposit(address _user, address _token)`: View function. Gets details of a user's deposit for a specific token.
*   `getConditionDetails(uint256 _conditionId)`: View function. Gets details of a specific condition.
*   `getStrategyDetails(uint256 _strategyId)`: View function. Gets details of a specific strategy.
*   `getStrategyConditions(uint256 _strategyId)`: View function. Gets the list of condition IDs for a strategy.
*   `getStrategyStatus(uint256 _strategyId)`: View function. Gets the current status of a strategy.
*   `getStrategyTVL(uint256 _strategyId, address _token)`: View function. Gets the total value locked for a specific token within a specific strategy.
*   `getApprovedTokensForStrategy(uint256 _strategyId)`: View function. Gets the list of allowed tokens for a strategy.
*   `getConditionStatus(uint256 _conditionId)`: View function (internal logic exposed). Checks the current *status* of a condition based on its type (e.g., time check, oracle check - *simulated*).
*   `getConditionMetStatus(uint256 _conditionId)`: View function. Returns `true` if a condition is currently met based on `getConditionStatus`.
*   `getWithdrawalFeePercentage()`: View function. Gets the current withdrawal fee percentage.
*   `getTotalValueLocked(address _token)`: View function. Gets the total value locked for a specific token across all strategies.
*   `getStrategyDepositorCount(uint256 _strategyId)`: View function. Gets the number of unique depositors in a strategy.

         // role requires a specific state or mechanism not fully defined here.
         // Removing this function as it requires a more complex role system than simple mappings.
         revisit: The prompt asked for *interesting* functions. Transferring a key role like governorship *is* interesting. Let's re-add it but add a requirement that the caller *must* be the *initial* governor or similar, acknowledging the limitation of the simple mapping role system. Or, let's make it that *any* governor can propose a *full* transfer, and it requires multiple votes. Too complex for this example. Let's remove it and rely on `addGovernor`/`removeGovernor` for managing a *set* of governors.

         // Alternative: Keep transferGovernorship, but simplify: only the initial governor (set in constructor) can call this.
         // This requires storing the initial governor address. Let's add `initialGovernor`.

         // initialGovernor = _newGovernor;
         // This creates a single transferable owner-like governor role among potential multiple governors. Okay, let's add this.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**

1.  **Security Audit:** This contract is complex and involves significant value transfer. It absolutely requires a professional security audit before any production use. The provided code is for demonstration and learning purposes.
2.  **Oracle Integration:** The oracle functionality (`ORACLE_PRICE_ABOVE`, `ORACLE_PRICE_BELOW`, `EXTERNAL_SIGNAL` condition types and `signalExternalConditionMet`) is simulated by trusting a single `oracleAddress`. A real-world scenario would use robust decentralized oracle networks (like Chainlink, Tellor, etc.) with proper adapters or data feeds.
3.  **Role Management:** The basic `governors` and `strategists` mappings provide simple role checks. A more advanced system might use OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` or a custom multi-signature mechanism for critical actions (like activating strategies, emergency withdrawals, changing fees).
4.  **Multi-sig for Governance:** For truly decentralized governance over critical functions (like `activateStrategy`, `cancelStrategy`, `emergencyWithdraw`, `setWithdrawalFeePercentage`, `setOracleAddress`, adding/removing governors/strategists), these functions should ideally be callable only after a successful proposal and voting period, potentially managed by a separate DAO contract interacting with this vault. The current implementation gives significant power to individual addresses with roles.
5.  **Error Handling:** Basic `require` statements are included. More detailed error codes or custom errors could be used.
6.  **Gas Costs:** Complex loops (like checking all conditions in `_checkAllConditionsMet`) can become expensive with many conditions or many strategies/users. Gas optimization might be needed for production.
7.  **Upgradeability:** This contract is not upgradeable by default. For long-term projects, consider upgradeability patterns (like proxies) carefully.
8.  **Strategy Completion:** The `COMPLETED` status is defined but not actively used or set based on strategy logic within this version. A real strategy might transition to `COMPLETED` automatically if, for example, its time conditions pass or target values are met, preventing further deposits.
9.  **Deposit Transfer (`transferDeposit`):** While added for complexity, transferring a locked position with conditions requires careful consideration of potential edge cases and user experience. The new owner fully inherits the position's state (amount, original deposit time, strategy link).
10. **TVL Tracking:** The TVL tracking is basic. For complex strategies that might move funds internally (not implemented here), TVL tracking becomes more involved. The `emergencyWithdraw` function explicitly bypasses this tracking.

This contract provides a framework for conditional asset locking based on flexible, multi-factor strategies, offering a good example of advanced concepts beyond typical token contracts.
