Okay, let's design a smart contract system called "Dynamic Catalyst Pools".

**Concept:** This system allows users to stake a base token (e.g., USDC) into various "Catalyst Pools," each representing a different high-impact, speculative initiative (like AI research, Fusion Energy, Environmental Restoration). The yield generated by staking is not fixed but is dynamic. It depends on the total staked amount, time, global "Discovery Factor," the pool's specific "Breakthrough Probability," and a simulated "Breakthrough Outcome" which randomly changes the pool's yield parameters over time. The contract owner or designated managers can trigger these simulated breakthrough events, and also adjust global factors and pool parameters, introducing elements of decentralized governance/management over a simulated, evolving investment landscape. Users also have an "Engagement Score" that can influence their yield, adding a potential layer for future reputation or activity tracking.

**Advanced Concepts Used:**
1.  **Dynamic Yield Calculation:** Yield is not a simple percentage but calculated based on multiple fluctuating on-chain variables (global factor, pool factor, time, user score, *and* outcomes of simulated events).
2.  **Simulated Probabilistic Events:** A function (`simulateBreakthrough`) introduces controlled randomness (acknowledging chain limitations and suggesting oracle use for production) to change pool parameters, mimicking uncertain real-world R&D outcomes.
3.  **State-Dependent Parameters:** Pool yield factors and risk are not static but change based on `simulateBreakthrough` outcomes.
4.  **Manager Role:** Introduction of a separate role (`Manager`) besides `Owner` for executing core operational functions like simulating breakthroughs, allowing for potential decentralization beyond a single owner.
5.  **User Engagement Factor:** A placeholder for a reputation or activity system that can directly influence staking yield.
6.  **Configurable Risk/Reward:** Pools have adjustable probability, risk, and base yield factors set by managers/owner.
7.  **Epoch-Based Yield Updates (Simplified):** Yield calculation is based on time since the *last yield update* or *breakthrough simulation*, implicitly creating dynamic epochs.
8.  **Custom Errors:** Gas-efficient error handling.

**Outline:**

8.  **Modifiers:**

    *   `onlyManagerOrOwner`
9.  **Constructor:** Sets owner and base token address.
10. **Functions (25+):**
    *   Access Control (Owner/Manager Management)
    *   Pool Management (Creation, Parameter Updates)

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address _baseToken)`: Initializes the contract with the base token address.
2.  `createCatalystPool(uint256 _probability, uint256 _riskFactor, uint256 _baseYieldFactor)`: Creates a new catalyst pool with initial parameters. `onlyOwner`.
3.  `stake(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount)`: Allows a user to stake `_amount` of the base token into `_poolId`. Transfers tokens, records stake.
4.  `unstake(uint256 _poolId)`: Allows a user to unstake their entire stake from `_poolId`. Calculates pending yield/loss based on dynamic factors and simulated outcomes up to the current time, transfers stake + net yield, removes stake record.
5.  `claimYield(uint256 _poolId)`: Allows a user to claim only the pending yield from their stake in `_poolId`. Calculates yield up to current time, transfers yield, updates last yield claim time for the stake.
6.  `simulateBreakthrough(uint256 _poolId)`: Triggers a simulated probabilistic breakthrough event for `_poolId`. Based on the pool's probability and randomness, updates its yield factor and potentially risk factor. `onlyManagerOrOwner`.
7.  `updateGlobalDiscoveryFactor(uint256 _newFactor)`: Updates the global multiplier affecting yield across all pools. `onlyManagerOrOwner`.
8.  `updatePoolParameters(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _probability, uint256 _riskFactor, uint256 _baseYieldFactor)`: Allows owner/manager to adjust specific pool parameters. `onlyManagerOrOwner`.
9.  `setBaseYieldRate(uint256 _newRate)`: Sets the protocol-wide base yield rate. `onlyOwner`.
10. `setEngagementBoostFactor(uint256 _newFactor)`: Sets how much the engagement score influences yield. `onlyOwner`.
11. `updateUserEngagementScore(address _user, uint256 _score)`: Placeholder function to set a user's engagement score. `onlyManagerOrOwner`. (In a real system, this would be driven by on-chain activity or external proofs).
12. `calculatePendingYield(address _user, uint256 _poolId)`: View function to estimate the pending yield for a user's stake in a pool. *Note: This is an estimation based on current parameters and last update time; exact yield is calculated at `unstake`/`claimYield`.*
13. `getUserStakeInfo(address _user, uint256 _poolId)`: View function to get details about a user's stake in a specific pool.
14. `getPoolInfo(uint256 _poolId)`: View function to get parameters and state of a pool.

16. `getUserEngagementScore(address _user)`: View function to get a user's engagement score.
17. `getAllPoolIds()`: View function to get a list of all created pool IDs.
18. `addManager(address _manager)`: Adds an address to the list of allowed managers. `onlyOwner`.

24. `deactivatePool(uint256 _poolId)`: Deactivates a pool, preventing new stakes but allowing unstaking/claiming. `onlyOwner`.
25. `getPoolTotalStaked(uint256 _poolId)`: View function for the total amount staked in a pool.
26. `getBaseTokenAddress()`: View function to get the address of the base staking token.

**Explanation of Code Details:**

1.  **Base Token:** The contract is initialized with the address of the ERC-20 token used for staking (`BASE_TOKEN`).
2.  **Access Control:** Uses simple `onlyOwner` and `onlyManagerOrOwner` modifiers. The `s_allowedManagers` mapping tracks additional addresses that can perform manager-level actions (like simulating breakthroughs and updating parameters). Note the limitation mentioned regarding immutable `i_owner` vs. a mutable `owner` variable for standard `transferOwnership`.
3.  **CatalystPool Struct:** Holds all the dynamic parameters for each pool, including `probability` (chance of breakthrough), `riskFactor`, `baseYieldFactor`, `totalStaked`, and timestamps for yield calculation. Parameters like probability, riskFactor, and baseYieldFactor are scaled (0-1000) to represent percentages (0-100.0%) for integer math simplicity.
4.  **UserStake Struct:** Tracks each user's individual stake in a specific pool, including the amount, the initial stake time, and crucially, `lastYieldUpdateTime` which marks the last time yield was calculated/claimed for *that specific stake*.
5.  **Dynamic Yield Calculation (`_calculateNetOutcome`):** This is the core complex part. It calculates yield based on:
    *   `stakeAmount`: The user's principal.
    *   `timeElapsed`: Time since `lastYieldUpdateTime`.
    *   `baseYieldRate`: Global protocol rate.
    *   `globalDiscoveryFactor`: Global multiplier.
    *   `pool.baseYieldFactor`: Pool-specific multiplier (changes with breakthroughs).
    *   `s_userEngagementScores[_user]`: User's score boosting yield.
    *   `pool.riskFactor`: Pool-specific risk reducing yield (or applying loss).
    *   It uses a `SCALE_FACTOR` (1e18) and `YIELD_TIME_UNIT` (1 day) to perform calculations with integers while simulating floating-point arithmetic over time.
    *   The loss calculation is a separate component based on `riskFactor` and time.
    *   `claimYield` transfers only *positive* net yield. `unstake` transfers principal + net outcome (which could be less than principal if loss > yield).
6.  **Simulate Breakthrough (`simulateBreakthrough`):** This function is the engine of dynamism. It uses `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` for randomness. **IMPORTANT:** As noted in the code, this is insecure for production. A real system needs a secure oracle (like Chainlink VRF). Based on the random outcome compared to the pool's `probability`, it adjusts the pool's `baseYieldFactor` and `riskFactor`, changing future yield/loss accrual rates. It updates `lastUpdateTime` for the pool, which acts like an epoch marker for yield calculation going forward.
7.  **Parameter Updates:** `updateGlobalDiscoveryFactor`, `updatePoolParameters`, `setBaseYieldRate`, `setEngagementBoostFactor` allow the owner/managers to tune the system's economics and pool behaviors.
8.  **Engagement Score:** `updateUserEngagementScore` is provided as a hook. It doesn't implement a complex scoring logic but allows an authorized address to set a score that directly plugs into the yield calculation. This makes the contract ready to integrate with an external reputation or activity tracking system.
9.  **Query Functions:** A variety of view functions are included to inspect the state of pools, user stakes, global parameters, and calculate estimated pending yield.
10. **Emergency Withdrawal:** A standard function to recover non-base tokens accidentally sent to the contract.

This contract goes beyond basic staking by introducing dynamic parameters, simulated events influencing those parameters, multiple roles, and a pluggable engagement score, offering a foundation for a complex, evolving decentralized application themed around uncertain R&D investments.
