Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract incorporating several advanced, creative, and less common concepts centered around a "Quantum Flux Vault." This contract manages Ether and a specified ERC20 token, with complex withdrawal conditions tied to a dynamic "Quantum Flux Level" and "Quantum State," user-specific calibration, and even simulated "entanglement" between user withdrawal conditions.

It avoids direct duplication of standard OpenZeppelin patterns like `Ownable`, `ERC20`, or `Pausable` by implementing similar logic manually, but the underlying concepts (ownership, pausing, token standards) are fundamental building blocks. The unique logic lies in the state machine, flux dynamics, conditional locking mechanisms, user calibration, and entanglement simulation.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex example for demonstration purposes. Real-world smart contracts require rigorous auditing, testing, and careful consideration of gas costs and potential edge cases. The ERC20 handling here is simplified and would ideally use libraries like OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` in a production environment, but that would violate the "don't duplicate open source" constraint for the core logic.

## QuantumFluxVault Smart Contract Outline

1.  **Purpose:** A vault for Ether and a specific ERC20 token where withdrawal conditions are governed by a dynamic "Quantum Flux" level, contract "Quantum State," user-defined conditional locks, user-specific "Flux Calibration," and simulated "Entanglement" links between users.
2.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Quantum Flux:** A numerical value that changes over time or via specific actions.
    *   **Quantum State:** Discrete states (Stable, Turbulent, Critical, Entangled) determined by the Flux level.
    *   **Conditional Locks:** Users can lock funds based on time, a required Flux level, or a required Quantum State.
    *   **User Flux Calibration:** Users can slightly influence the *effective* Flux level used for their *own* unlock conditions.
    *   **Entanglement Links:** Users can link their withdrawal eligibility to the state or actions of another user.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (Custom):** Fine-grained permissions for administrative actions.
    *   **Pausable (Custom):** Ability to pause critical operations.
3.  **State Variables:**
    *   Owner address.
    *   Custom RBAC roles and mappings.
    *   Pausable state.
    *   ERC20 token address.
    *   Contract's current Ether and internal ERC20 balances.
    *   Current Quantum Flux level and its rate of change.
    *   Timestamp of the last Flux update.
    *   Flux thresholds for state transitions.
    *   Current Quantum State.
    *   Mapping for user Ether balances.
    *   Mapping for user ERC20 balances.
    *   Mapping for user lock details (struct).
    *   Mapping for user Flux Calibration values.
    *   Mapping for Entanglement links (user A -> user B).
4.  **Enums:** `QuantumState`, `LockConditionType`.
5.  **Structs:** `UserLock`.
6.  **Events:** Signal state changes, deposits, withdrawals, locks, unlocks, role changes, pausing.
7.  **Modifiers (Custom):** `onlyOwner`, `onlyRole`, `whenNotPaused`, `whenPaused`.
8.  **Functions (20+ Total):** See summary below.

## QuantumFluxVault Function Summary

*(Note: Functions marked `view` or `pure` don't change state or cost gas beyond reading.)*

1.  `constructor`: Initializes owner, roles, token address, initial state, and flux parameters.
2.  `receive()`: Allows receiving plain Ether deposits into the contract.
3.  `depositEther()`: Records deposited Ether for a specific user.
4.  `depositERC20(uint256 amount)`: Pulls ERC20 tokens from user (requires prior approval) and records balance.
5.  `updateFlux()`: Calculates elapsed time and updates `fluxLevel` based on `fluxChangeRate`. Automatically triggers `transitionState`. Callable by FLUX_MANAGER_ROLE.
6.  `transitionState()`: Internal function called after `updateFlux`. Changes `currentState` based on `fluxLevel` and defined thresholds. Can be force-triggered by STATE_CONTROLLER_ROLE.
7.  `forceStateTransition(QuantumState newState)`: Allows STATE_CONTROLLER_ROLE to manually set the state (within allowed transitions or override).
8.  `triggerEntanglementEffect()`: A conceptual function (simplified here) that could introduce a temporary modifier or event based on the current state/flux. Callable by ENTANGLEMENT_ROLE.
9.  `lockFundsConditional(uint256 amount, address tokenAddress, LockConditionType conditionType, uint256 conditionValue)`: Users lock their internal balance based on a time duration, minimum flux level, or required state.
10. `unlockFundsBasedOnCondition()`: Allows a user to attempt to unlock their funds if their specific lock condition is met *and* the current contract state allows withdrawals from the user's locked state.
11. `initiateUserFluxCalibration(int256 calibrationValue)`: Allows users to set a personal calibration value that is added/subtracted from the global `fluxLevel` *only* when checking *their* unlock conditions.
12. `registerEntanglementLink(address linkedUser)`: Allows a user to link their withdrawal condition eligibility to another user's state or lock status. Requires consent from the linked user (simplified: requires linked user to have a lock).
13. `checkUserUnlockEligibility(address user, address tokenAddress)`: `view` function. Checks if a user's locked funds for a specific token *could* be unlocked based on current state, flux, user calibration, and any entanglement links.
14. `checkEntanglementLinkStatus(address user)`: `view` function. Checks if a user has an active entanglement link and the address it's linked to.
15. `resolveEntanglementWithdrawal(address tokenAddress)`: Allows a user with an entanglement link to attempt withdrawal, requiring their *own* lock condition *and* a specific condition related to the *linked* user (e.g., linked user is also eligible, or linked user is in a certain state).
16. `getCurrentQuantumState()`: `view` function. Returns the current `currentState`.
17. `getCurrentFluxLevel()`: `view` function. Returns the current `fluxLevel`.
18. `getUserLockDetails(address user, address tokenAddress)`: `view` function. Returns the details of a user's active lock for a token.
19. `getUserCalibration(address user)`: `view` function. Returns a user's flux calibration value.
20. `hasRole(address user, bytes32 role)`: `view` function. Checks if an address has a specific role.
21. `grantRole(bytes32 role, address user)`: Grants a role to an address. Callable by address with that role + `_ROLE_ADMIN`. (Owner is default admin).
22. `revokeRole(bytes32 role, address user)`: Revokes a role. Callable by address with that role + `_ROLE_ADMIN`.
23. `pauseContract()`: Pauses critical functions. Callable by PAUSER_ROLE.
24. `unpauseContract()`: Unpauses the contract. Callable by PAUSER_ROLE.
25. `emergencyOwnerWithdrawEther(uint256 amount)`: Owner/EMERGENCY_WITHDRAW_ROLE can withdraw Ether ignoring state/locks (for emergencies).
26. `emergencyOwnerWithdrawERC20(uint256 amount)`: Owner/EMERGENCY_WITHDRAW_ROLE can withdraw ERC20 ignoring state/locks.
27. `setFluxRate(int256 newRate)`: Allows FLUX_MANAGER_ROLE to set the rate of flux change.
28. `setFluxThresholds(uint256 stableMax, uint256 turbulentMax, uint256 criticalMax)`: Allows STATE_CONTROLLER_ROLE to set flux thresholds for state transitions.
29. `getUserBalance(address user, address tokenAddress)`: `view` function. Returns a user's internal tracked balance for Ether (address(0)) or ERC20.
30. `getTotalVaultBalanceEther()`: `view` function. Returns the total Ether held by the contract.
31. `getTotalVaultBalanceERC20()`: `view` function. Returns the total balance of the designated ERC20 held by the contract.
32. `allowEntanglementLink(address requestingUser)`: Allows a user to grant permission for another user to link to them. (Adds reciprocal check for entanglement).
