Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract designed with several advanced, interesting, and interconnected concepts, aiming for uniqueness beyond simple token or NFT standards.

It represents an **OmniVault** â€“ a vault capable of holding multiple types of assets (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) and executing approved yield-generating or asset-managing strategies against those pooled assets. It incorporates role-based access control, a strategy approval and timelock system, fee collection, and delegated strategy execution.

**Important Considerations:**

1.  **Complexity:** This contract is complex. It requires careful design and auditing for production use.
2.  **External Contracts:** It relies heavily on interacting with external Strategy contracts (which would need to be defined and implemented separately based on an `IStrategy` interface) and standard token contracts.
3.  **Gas Costs:** Managing multiple asset types and mappings can lead to significant gas costs, especially for deposit/withdrawal functions involving complex state updates.
4.  **Value Tracking:** The contract *manages* assets by quantity/ownership but doesn't inherently track their *fiat or ETH value*. Strategies would need to handle value reporting if performance fees based on value were needed (this example uses withdrawal fees based on quantity).
5.  **Uniqueness:** While individual *concepts* like vaults, strategies, access control, and timelocks exist in open source (often in isolation or specific combinations), the *combination* of handling ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets within the *same* strategy-executing vault with this specific set of features is intended to be a creative and non-standard assembly.

**Explanation of Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Handling:** The vault explicitly manages balances and ownership for ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens within a single contract. This is less common than single-asset vaults. Separate mappings track user deposits for each type.
2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` to define specific roles (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, `STRATEGIST_MANAGER_ROLE`, `STRATEGY_EXECUTION_ROLE`, `FEE_COLLECTOR_ROLE`) with distinct permissions, moving beyond a simple `onlyOwner` model.
3.  **Strategy Pattern:** The vault interacts with external `IStrategy` contracts. This allows different yield-generating or asset-management logics to be plugged into the vault without changing the core vault code.
4.  **Approved Strategies:** Only strategies explicitly added to the `approvedStrategies` list by the `STRATEGIST_MANAGER_ROLE` can be used. This provides a layer of security.
5.  **Timelocked Strategy Changes:** Changing the active strategy (`currentStrategy`) requires a proposal phase followed by a timelock (`strategyTimelockDuration`). This prevents sudden, potentially malicious strategy changes and gives users time to react.
6.  **Delegated Strategy Execution:** The `STRATEGY_EXECUTION_ROLE` can delegate the right to call `executeCurrentStrategy` to other addresses. This allows for automation or specialized bots to execute strategies without granting full role permissions.
7.  **Withdrawal Fees:** A configurable fee (`withdrawalFeeRate`) is applied to ERC-20 and ERC-1155 withdrawals, collected by the vault, and made available to a designated `feeRecipient`. This allows the vault operator to capture value. Fees are collected *per token type*, requiring separate collection functions.
8.  **Emergency Sweeps:** Functions are included to recover tokens or NFTs accidentally sent to the vault address that weren't part of a standard deposit flow, controllable by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
9.  **Reentrancy Guard:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` on functions performing external calls after state changes (withdrawals, strategy execution, sweeps) to prevent reentrancy attacks.
10. **Safe Transfers:** Uses OpenZeppelin's safe transfer libraries (`SafeERC20`, `SafeERC721`, `SafeERC1155`) to handle interactions with token contracts robustly, including checking return values and handling pre/post conditions.
11. **Explicit Interfaces:** Defines a minimal `IStrategy` interface to clarify the interaction pattern with external strategy contracts.
12. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Uses custom Solidity `error` types for clearer and more gas-efficient error reporting.
13. **Events:** Emits detailed events for key actions (deposits, withdrawals, strategy changes, role updates, fee collection) for off-chain monitoring and indexing.
14. **Structured State:** Organizes state variables logically, including separate mappings for user balances per asset type, strategy details, and fee information.

This contract provides a foundation for a sophisticated multi-asset vault system, incorporating several advanced concepts and providing a rich set of functions (well over the requested 20) for managing assets, strategies, and permissions.
