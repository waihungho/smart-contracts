Okay, let's create a smart contract system combining several concepts:
1.  **Soulbound-like tokens:** Non-transferable tokens representing identity or commitment.
2.  **Time-based resource generation:** These tokens accrue a separate, transferable resource over time.
3.  **Dynamic NFTs:** An NFT whose properties and appearance (via `tokenURI`) change based on accrued resources or actions.
4.  **On-chain Governance:** Using the accrued resource to vote on system parameters or proposals.
5.  **Delegation:** Allowing users to delegate their resource generation power or voting power.

This system can be called "Chronos Sanctuary", where users hold non-transferable "Chronons" representing their stake in the system's timeline. These Chronons passively generate "Aether", a transferable resource used to evolve "Temporal Guardian" NFTs and participate in governance.

We will *not* use standard ERC-20 or ERC-721 for the Chronon and Aether primarily to implement custom soulbinding and resource accrual logic, making it less of a direct duplicate of common patterns, although the Temporal Guardian will use ERC-721 for standard NFT interoperability.

## Contract Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `ChronosSanctuary`

**Core Concepts:**
*   **Chronons:** Non-transferable tokens representing user's stake/presence. Mapped `address => uint256` count. Soulbound by design (no transfer function).
*   **Aether:** Transferable resource generated by Chronons over time. Mapped `address => uint256` balance. Has basic transfer/allowance like ERC-20 but implemented custom.
*   **Temporal Guardians:** ERC-721 NFTs whose metadata is dynamic based on Aether spent for upgrades.
*   **Time-Based Accrual:** Aether is generated based on the number of Chronons held and time elapsed since the last claim.
*   **Governance:** Aether holders (or delegates) can propose and vote on changes to system parameters.
*   **Delegation:** Users can delegate the Aether generation power of their Chronons and their Aether voting power.

**Function Summary:**

**I. Chronon (Soulbound Token) Management:**
1.  `mintChronon(address account, uint256 amount)`: Mints Chronons to a specific account (permissioned). Updates last Aether claim time.
2.  `burnChronon(uint256 amount)`: Burns Chronons from the caller's account.
3.  `balanceOfChronons(address account)`: Returns the number of Chronons held by an account.
4.  `delegateChrononAccrual(address delegatee)`: Delegates the Aether generation power of the caller's Chronons.
5.  `getChrononAccrualDelegatee(address delegator)`: Returns the address the delegator has delegated Chronon accrual power to.
6.  `getChrononAccrualPower(address account)`: Calculates the *effective* Chronon count for accrual (self + delegated to them).

**II. Aether (Time-Based Resource) Management:**
7.  `claimAether()`: Allows caller to claim accrued Aether based on their Chronon holdings and time.
8.  `balanceOfAether(address account)`: Returns the Aether balance of an account.
9.  `transferAether(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers Aether from caller to recipient.
10. `approveAether(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Approves a spender to withdraw Aether from caller's account.
11. `transferFromAether(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Transfers Aether using an allowance.
12. `allowanceAether(address owner, address spender)`: Returns the allowance granted by owner to spender.
13. `getAetherGenerationRatePerChronon()`: Returns the current Aether generation rate per Chronon per second (view).

**III. Temporal Guardian (Dynamic NFT) Management:**
14. `mintGuardian()`: Mints a new Temporal Guardian NFT to the caller (requires minimum Chronons or Aether, configurable).
15. `upgradeGuardian(uint256 tokenId)`: Spends Aether to upgrade a specific Guardian NFT, changing its properties.
16. `getGuardianLevel(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the current upgrade level of a Guardian NFT.
17. `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Overrides ERC-721 tokenURI to provide dynamic metadata based on NFT properties.
18. Standard ERC-721 functions (inherited from OpenZeppelin):
    *   `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)`
    *   `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data)`
    *   `approve(address to, uint256 tokenId)`
    *   `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`
    *   `getApproved(uint256 tokenId)`
    *   `isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator)`
    *   `ownerOf(uint256 tokenId)`
    *   `balanceOf(address owner)`
    *   `name()`
    *   `symbol()`

**IV. Governance:**
19. `proposeParameterChange(bytes memory callData, string memory description)`: Allows users meeting requirements to propose changing a system parameter via a function call.
20. `voteOnProposal(uint256 proposalId, bool support)`: Votes on an active proposal using Aether voting power.
21. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successful proposal.
22. `delegateVotePower(address delegatee)`: Delegates the caller's Aether voting power.
23. `getVoteDelegatee(address delegator)`: Returns the address the delegator has delegated voting power to.
24. `getAetherVotePower(address account)`: Calculates the effective Aether count for voting (self + delegated to them).
25. `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns the state of a specific proposal (Pending, Active, Canceled, Defeated, Succeeded, Queued, Expired, Executed).
26. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId)`: Returns details of a specific proposal.

**V. System Parameters & Access Control:**
27. `addAuthorizedMinter(address minter)`: Grants permission to call `mintChronon` (owner only).
28. `removeAuthorizedMinter(address minter)`: Revokes permission to call `mintChronon` (owner only).
29. `setAetherGenerationRate(uint256 rate)`: Sets the Aether generation rate (callable only via governance).
30. `setGuardianMintCostAether(uint256 cost)`: Sets the Aether cost to mint a Guardian (callable only via governance).
31. `setGuardianUpgradeCostAether(uint256 cost)`: Sets the Aether cost for Guardian upgrades (callable only via governance).
32. `setProposalThreshold(uint256 threshold)`: Sets the minimum Aether voting power required to create a proposal (callable only via governance).
33. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 duration)`: Sets the duration of the voting period for proposals (callable only via governance).
34. `withdrawExcessEth()`: Allows the owner to withdraw any accidentally sent Ether (safety function).
35. `renounceOwnership()`: Relinquishes contract ownership (Ownable).
36. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership (Ownable).

**(Note: The ERC-721 standard itself requires many functions (balanceOf, ownerOf, transferFrom, approve, etc.). We inherit these, adding the dynamic `tokenURI`. The custom Aether logic also mirrors ERC-20 functions. The governance system adds several functions. This easily gets us past 20 unique *public/external* functions implementing specific logic.)**

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Soulbound/Non-Transferable Tokens (`_chrononBalances`):** Chronons are implemented as a simple mapping `address => uint256` without any `transfer` or `transferFrom` functions. This makes them inherently non-transferable on the contract level, simulating a soulbound property. The only ways to change the balance are `mintChronon` (permissioned) and `burnChronon`.
2.  **Time-Based Accrual (`claimAether`, `_lastAetherClaimTime`):** Aether generation is tied to the real-world time elapsed (`block.timestamp`) and the Chronon balance. The `_lastAetherClaimTime` mapping tracks when an address last interacted or had their balance updated, allowing calculation of the pending Aether since then. This is a common pattern for passive income/resource generation in smart contracts.
3.  **Dynamic NFTs (`TemporalGuardian`, `_guardianLevels`, `tokenURI` override):** The `TemporalGuardian` is a standard ERC-721, but its key feature is the dynamic `tokenURI`. Instead of pointing to static metadata, `tokenURI` fetches the NFT's current level (`_guardianLevels`) and includes it in the URI. A decentralized application or backend service would listen for `TemporalGuardianUpgraded` events and serve dynamic JSON metadata from that URI, changing the NFT's appearance or properties in wallets/marketplaces based on its on-chain level.
4.  **Custom Transferable Resource (`_aetherBalances`, `_aetherAllowances`):** Aether has basic transfer, approve, and transferFrom functionality similar to ERC-20, but implemented manually. This avoids direct inheritance of ERC-20, fitting the "don't duplicate open source" request more closely for this specific token, while still providing necessary token functionality. The `_claimAether` call is integrated into relevant functions (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `mintGuardian`, `upgradeGuardian`, `proposeParameterChange`, `voteOnProposal`) to ensure the user's Aether balance is up-to-date *before* spending or checking thresholds.
5.  **On-Chain Governance (`Proposal` struct, `proposeParameterChange`, `voteOnProposal`, `executeProposal`):**
    *   A basic governance module is included where Aether holders can propose changes.
    *   Proposals are structured to include `callData` (`bytes`), allowing them to target specific functions *within this contract* to change parameters. This is a form of executable governance.
    *   Voting power (`getAetherVotePower`) is based on Aether balance (simplified).
    *   `executeProposal` uses a low-level `.call()` to execute the proposed `callData`. This is powerful but requires careful consideration of which functions can be targeted and how `callData` is constructed to prevent malicious proposals. The `onlyGovernance` modifier ensures these sensitive setter functions can *only* be called by the contract itself during a successful proposal execution.
6.  **Delegation (`delegateChrononAccrual`, `delegateVotePower`):** Users can delegate their Chronon's Aether generation power and their Aether's voting power. *Note: The calculation of *effective* power (`getChrononAccrualPower`, `getAetherVotePower`) is simplified in this example to avoid complex on-chain data structures needed for efficient delegation tracking. A production system would require a more robust method, perhaps inspired by Compound's delegation pattern using checkpoints.*
7.  **Access Control (`Ownable`, `authorizedMinters`, `onlyAuthorizedMinter`, `onlyGovernance`):** Uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` for contract administration (like adding minters). A custom `authorizedMinters` set and `onlyAuthorizedMinter` modifier control who can mint Chronons. The `onlyGovernance` modifier restricts sensitive parameter-setting functions, ensuring they can only be called via the governance execution process.
8.  **Structs and Enums:** Use of structs (`Proposal`) to organize complex data and implied enums (via `uint8` return value in `getProposalState`) for clarity.
9.  **SafeMath:** Inherited from OpenZeppelin (though Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow/underflow checks, SafeMath is still good practice for clarity or with older Solidity versions).
10. **EnumerableSet:** Used for `authorizedMinters` to easily add, remove, and check membership in a permissioned set.

This contract provides a blueprint for an interconnected ecosystem with unique token dynamics, evolving NFTs, and community-driven parameter control, aiming for creative and advanced features beyond typical simple token or NFT contracts.
