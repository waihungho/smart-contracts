Okay, here's a Solidity smart contract that implements a decentralized prediction market with a focus on **dynamic event resolution through a community-driven oracle and tokenized prediction rewards.**  This design aims to address some common shortcomings of prediction markets, like single-oracle dependence and low participation due to lack of immediate incentive.

**Outline:**

1.  **Contract Goal:** Create a decentralized prediction market platform where users can predict the outcome of events, stake ETH, and earn rewards based on prediction accuracy, with event resolution handled by a community-driven, token-weighted oracle.
2.  **Key Features:**
    *   **Event Creation:** Allow anyone to propose events with specific end times and outcome options.
    *   **Staking & Prediction:** Users stake ETH to predict an event's outcome.
    *   **Community Oracle:**  Token holders (of a governance token internal to this contract) vote on the event outcome after the event's end time.
    *   **Dynamic Resolution:**  The oracle decision is weighted by token holdings, adding a layer of community trust.
    *   **Tokenized Prediction Rewards:** Reward accurate predictors with tokens based on their stake and the overall accuracy of the prediction pool.

**Function Summary:**

*   `createEvent(string memory _description, uint256 _endTime, string[] memory _outcomes)`:  Creates a new prediction event.
*   `predict(uint256 _eventId, uint256 _outcomeIndex) payable`:  Allows users to stake ETH and predict the outcome of an event.
*   `voteOnOutcome(uint256 _eventId, uint256 _outcomeIndex)`: Allows governance token holders to vote on the outcome of an event.
*   `resolveEvent(uint256 _eventId)`:  Resolves the event based on the oracle vote, distributing rewards to accurate predictors.
*   `claimRewards(uint256 _eventId)`: Allows users to claim their rewards after the event is resolved.
*   `getEventDetails(uint256 _eventId)`: Returns details about a specific event.
*   `getTokenBalance(address _account)`: Returns the token balance of the input account.
*   `mintTokens(address _account, uint256 _amount)`: Allows the owner to mint governance tokens (for initial distribution or staking rewards).
*   `transferTokens(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to other account.

**Key Improvements and Concepts:**

*   **Community Oracle (Token Voting):** The `voteOnOutcome` function and the internal `_getWinningOutcome` function create a community-driven oracle. Token holders (governance token) vote, and their vote weight is determined by the number of tokens they hold. This adds decentralization and resistance to single-point-of-failure oracles.  This is far from a perfect oracle solution (Sybil resistance is weak), but a foundation for something more robust.  The idea is the token's reputation would incentivize honest voting.
*   **Tokenized Prediction Rewards:** Users are not only rewarded in ETH, but also rewarded in the contract's governance tokens. This incentivizes long-term participation and helps bootstrap the community-driven oracle.
*   **Proportional Rewards:** Rewards are calculated proportionally to the user's stake relative to the total stake in the winning outcome.
*   **Claimable Rewards:**  Users must explicitly claim their rewards using `claimRewards`. This reduces gas costs by only paying out rewards to active participants.
*   **Event Resolution Logic:** The `resolveEvent` function centralizes the reward distribution process after the winning outcome has been determined.
*   **Event Struct:** The `Event` struct holds all relevant data for a prediction market event, including outcome options, end time, and resolution status.
*   **Modifiers:** Using modifiers like `onlyOwner`, `eventExists`, `notResolved`, and `hasTokens` enhances security and code readability.
*   **Events:** Events are used to track important actions within the contract, such as event creation, prediction placement, event resolution, and reward claims.
*   **Governance Token:**  The tokens (`tokenBalances`, `mintTokens`, `transferTokens`) are basic, but they provide the essential infrastructure for a governance token to be used in the community oracle.
*   **Upgradability:**  The current contract is not upgradable.  Consider using a proxy pattern (e.g., UUPS proxy) for upgradability in a production environment.
*   **Error Handling:**  More robust error handling can be added.

**Possible Further Enhancements:**

*   **Staking Governance Token:**  Require users to stake their governance tokens to participate in the oracle voting process. This could help to prevent Sybil attacks and align incentives further.
*   **Reputation System:** Implement a reputation system for token holders based on their past voting accuracy.  Reward those with a good track record.
*   **Time-Weighted Voting:** Implement time-weighted voting to incentivize earlier voting and potentially improve the quality of the oracle.
*   **Multi-Stage Resolution:**  Implement a multi-stage resolution process where there's a challenge period if a certain percentage of token holders disagree with the initial outcome.
*   **Bonded Outcome Options:**  Allow users to create outcome options with a bond of tokens.  This bond would be forfeited if the outcome is deemed invalid.
*   **Integration with External Oracles:**  Combine the community oracle with external oracles for a more reliable and robust resolution system.
*   **Fees:**  Add fees to predictions to generate revenue for the platform and reward token holders.
*   **Flash Loan Resistance:** Consider implementing flash loan resistance measures if the contract's logic depends on token balances or event stakes.
*   **Formal Verification:** For critical systems, consider formal verification to mathematically prove the correctness of the contract's logic.

This is a relatively complex example, and careful auditing and testing would be crucial before deploying it to a live environment.  The community oracle concept is particularly sensitive to manipulation, so extensive testing and game theory analysis would be required.
