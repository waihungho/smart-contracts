Okay, here is a smart contract concept called "Quantum Liquidity Hub". It incorporates advanced concepts like dynamic liquidity allocation based on on-chain conditions (simulated volatility score), conditional swaps, NFT-based boosts, dynamic yield calculation, and integrated governance.

It avoids duplicating standard AMM, lending, or simple staking contract patterns by focusing on user-defined strategies influencing their *share's behavior* within the pool, driven by external state updates.

**Disclaimer:** This is a complex conceptual contract. Implementing strategies and conditions purely on-chain in Solidity with gas efficiency is highly challenging. This contract uses `bytes` as placeholders for complex strategy/condition logic which would typically require off-chain interpretation or highly specialized on-chain libraries/VM extensions. The dynamic reallocation simulation is also simplified. **This contract is for illustrative purposes and would require significant development, optimization, and security auditing for production use.**

## Contract: QuantumLiquidityHub

**Purpose:** A decentralized hub for providing and managing liquidity with advanced dynamic features. Users deposit tokens into shared pools, but their effective contribution and yield are influenced by user-defined strategies, a global dynamic "volatility score", conditional swap execution, and NFT-based boosts.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Dynamic Liquidity Allocation:** A global "Volatility Score" (updated externally, e.g., by an Oracle or Keeper) influences how user-defined strategies affect the effective liquidity contribution of each user's deposit.
2.  **User-Defined Strategies:** Users can associate simple strategies (represented abstractly by `bytes`) with their token deposits, influencing how their share reacts to the global state (Volatility Score). Examples: "Risk-off" (reduce effective exposure during high volatility), "Risk-on" (increase exposure during high volatility), "Passive" (ignore volatility).
3.  **Conditional Swaps:** Allows users to execute swaps from the hub's pooled liquidity only if specific on-chain conditions (e.g., price thresholds, block number, external contract state) are met.
4.  **Quantum Boost NFTs:** Holders of a specific NFT contract receive preferential terms, such as increased yield or reduced swap fees.
5.  **Dynamic Yield:** Yield (from swap fees) is distributed not just based on deposit size, but also on the user's *effective liquidity* contribution over time, factoring in their strategy, the volatility score, and NFT boosts.
6.  **Integrated Governance:** A governance token allows holders to propose and vote on changes to core parameters (like swap fees, strategy types, oracle addresses).
