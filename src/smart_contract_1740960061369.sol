/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with Skill-Based Voting & Dynamic Token Allocation
 * @author [Your Name/Organization]
 * @notice This DAO contract implements a novel approach to governance by incorporating skill-based voting and dynamically allocating tokens to contributors based on their verifiable skills and contributions.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **Token Management:**  Manages the custom governance token (SKILL).
 * 2. **Skill Registry:** Allows users to register their skills and associated proofs (e.g., certificates, project links).
 * 3. **Proposal Creation:**  Allows token holders to submit proposals for changes within the DAO.
 * 4. **Skill-Weighted Voting:**  Votes are weighted based on the voter's proven skills relevant to the proposal's subject matter.
 * 5. **Dynamic Token Allocation:**  Periodically rewards contributors with new tokens based on the DAO's evaluation of their contributions, using a skill-based weighting.
 * 6. **Reputation System:** Tracks contributor reputation based on successful proposal execution and overall DAO participation.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _initialAdmin)`: Initializes the DAO with a governance token, a name, and an initial administrator.
 * - `registerSkill(string memory _skill, string memory _proofUri)`: Allows users to register their skills and provide proof of competence.
 * - `createProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string[] memory _relevantSkills, address _target, bytes memory _data)`: Creates a new proposal with a title, description, relevant skills, and target function call.
 * - `vote(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`:  Allows token holders to vote on a proposal, with voting power weighted by relevant skills.
 * - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a proposal if it passes, calling the target function with the provided data.
 * - `evaluateContributions(address[] memory _contributors, uint256[] memory _contributionScores)`:  (Admin only) Allows the admin to evaluate contributors and allocate new tokens based on their contribution scores.
 * - `distributeNewTokens()`: Distributes new tokens to contributors based on their allocated scores.
 * - `updateSkillProof(string memory _skill, string memory _newProofUri)`: Allows users to update their proofs of skill.
 * - `setSkillWeight(string memory _skill, uint256 _weight)`: (Admin Only) Sets the weight of each skill during proposal voting.
 * - `transferAdmin(address _newAdmin)`: (Admin Only) Transfers administrative privileges to a new address.

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

* **Skill Registry:**  Users can now register their skills with verifiable proofs (links to projects, certificates, etc.).  This information is stored on-chain.
* **Skill-Weighted Voting:** The `vote` function calculates voting power based on the voter's token balance *and* any relevant skills they have registered. The `relevantSkills` array is included in the proposal to identify which skills are important.  The `skillWeights` mapping allows the DAO to dynamically adjust the importance of each skill.  This means that people with expertise in the area being voted on have a stronger voice.
* **Dynamic Token Allocation:**  The `evaluateContributions` and `distributeNewTokens` functions implement a mechanism to reward contributors based on their work within the DAO.  The admin (or a designated "contribution committee") can assign scores to contributors, and then new tokens are minted and distributed proportionally to those scores.  This encourages active participation and incentivizes valuable contributions.
* **Reputation System:** The `contributorReputation` mapping tracks a reputation score for each member. This score increases when a contributor's proposal is successfully executed, or when they contribute to the token allocation.  This reputation score is then used to give a bonus to their voting power, further amplifying the influence of respected members.
* **Gas Optimizations:**  The code includes some basic gas optimizations (e.g., using `storage` keyword when modifying a `Proposal` struct).  More advanced optimizations (e.g., using assembly, caching values) could be implemented for production deployments.
* **Reentrancy Protection:**  The `tokenDistributionActive` state variable and the check at the beginning of the `distributeNewTokens` function provide basic reentrancy protection.  However, for complex logic, you might want to consider more robust reentrancy guard patterns.
* **Error Handling:**  The code uses `require` statements to validate inputs and prevent errors.
* **Events:**  The code emits events for important actions (proposal creation, voting, execution, skill registration, token distribution), making it easier to track the DAO's activity.
* **Admin Control:**  Key functions (setting skill weights, transferring admin) are restricted to the `admin` address.
* **Upgradeable Considerations:**  While this contract isn't directly upgradeable, you could design it with upgradeability in mind by using proxy patterns (e.g., Transparent Proxy Pattern, UUPS).
* **Clear Comments and Documentation:**  The code includes detailed comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable.
* **Security Considerations:**
    * **Admin Key Security:** The `admin` address is a critical vulnerability point.  In a production environment, the admin key should be held securely (e.g., using a multi-signature wallet, hardware wallet).
    * **Proposal Data Validation:**  The `executeProposal` function uses a low-level `call`.  It's crucial to carefully validate the `_target` and `_data` parameters of proposals to prevent malicious actors from executing arbitrary code.  Consider adding checks to restrict the target contracts to a whitelist of known and trusted contracts.
    * **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  The `pragma solidity ^0.8.0` directive enables built-in overflow/underflow protection, but it's still good practice to be mindful of potential arithmetic errors.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Be aware of potential DoS attacks, such as proposals with extremely large `_relevantSkills` arrays or token distribution with very large contributor arrays, which could make it costly to execute.
    * **Front-Running:**  Voting results could potentially be front-run. Implement commit-reveal schemes.
* **Further Improvements:**
    * **Delegate Voting:**  Allow token holders to delegate their voting power to other addresses.
    * **Timelock:**  Implement a timelock mechanism to delay the execution of proposals, giving token holders more time to react.
    * **Governance Modules:**  Design the DAO with modular governance, allowing different modules to be added or upgraded without affecting the core logic.
    * **Quadratic Voting:** Consider using quadratic voting to give more weight to individual preferences.
    * **Off-Chain Snapshotting:** For very large DAOs, consider using off-chain snapshotting for vote tallying to reduce gas costs.

This expanded explanation and improved contract provide a much more robust and feature-rich foundation for a Skill-Based DAO.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit your code before deploying it to a production environment.
