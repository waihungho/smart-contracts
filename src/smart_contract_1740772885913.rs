/**
 * @title Decentralized Dynamic Art Marketplace (DDAM) - NFT Evolution Through Staking and Collaboration
 * @author Bard (as assisted by a human)
 * @notice This contract enables the creation and trading of NFTs that evolve over time based on staking and collaborative community choices.  Artists create "Evolving NFTs" which have base properties.  Collectors can stake their NFTs, influencing the evolution path.  Community votes (weighted by stake duration) guide the NFT's evolution.  Revenue is shared amongst the original artist and those who influenced the final form via staking.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **NFT Creation (Artists):** Artists mint Evolving NFTs with initial properties (metadata).
 * 2. **Staking (Collectors):** Collectors stake their Evolving NFTs to earn influence and rewards.
 * 3. **Evolution Phases:** The contract progresses through evolution phases at predetermined intervals.
 * 4. **Community Voting:**  Collectors vote on evolution options (e.g., color palettes, new features) during each phase.  Vote power is weighted by stake duration.
 * 5. **NFT Mutation:** Based on voting results, the NFT's metadata is updated, reflecting its evolution.  A mutation script (ideally off-chain) uses these metadata updates to render new visuals.
 * 6. **Revenue Sharing:**  Fees from secondary sales are distributed proportionally to the original artist and stakers who influenced the final evolution.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - `createEvolvingNFT(string memory _name, string memory _description, string memory _initialMetadataURI, uint256 _royaltyPercentage):`  Allows an artist to create a new Evolving NFT.
 * - `stakeNFT(uint256 _tokenId):` Allows a collector to stake an NFT.
 * - `unstakeNFT(uint256 _tokenId):` Allows a collector to unstake an NFT.
 * - `startVotingPhase():` Starts a new voting phase (only callable by the contract owner).
 * - `vote(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _choice):`  Allows stakers to vote on an evolution option.
 * - `endVotingPhase():` Ends the voting phase, applies mutations based on voting results, and advances to the next evolution phase.
 * - `claimRewards(uint256 _tokenId):` Allows stakers and the artist to claim their revenue share from secondary sales.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a concise overview of the contract's purpose and functions at the top, improving readability and understanding.
* **Evolving NFT Structure:**  Uses a `struct` to store NFT-specific data (artist, name, description, metadata URI, royalty percentage, current evolution phase).  This keeps the data organized and easier to manage.
* **Staking Mechanism:**  Implements a staking mechanism where users can stake their NFTs to gain influence in the evolution process. The `Stake` struct keeps track of staking data.  Crucially, it keeps track of `totalStakedTime` which is used to weight votes.  It also uses a `startTime` and `endTime`  to easily calculate staking duration.  `nonReentrancyGuard` is added to prevent malicious contracts from exploiting the staking process.  A lastClaimedTime is also present to make claims easier.
* **Evolution Phases and Voting:**  Defines evolution phases with a voting system.  Collectors stake their NFTs to earn influence and rewards.  The `startVotingPhase` and `endVotingPhase` functions control the voting process.
* **Community Voting with Weighted Votes:** Collectors vote on evolution options (e.g., color palettes, new features) during each phase.  Crucially, vote power is weighted by stake duration (`stakes[_tokenId][msg.sender].totalStakedTime`). This is a key element of the design.
* **Dynamic Metadata Updates:**  The `endVotingPhase` function updates the NFT's metadata URI based on the voting results.  This allows the NFT's appearance to evolve over time.  The example uses a simple string concatenation for demonstration purposes; in a real-world application, an off-chain service would generate the new metadata based on the winning choice and other factors.
* **Revenue Sharing:** Includes a basic `claimRewards` function to distribute fees from secondary sales proportionally to the original artist and stakers who influenced the final evolution.  This requires further implementation for sales tracking.  A `platformFeePercentage` is also included.
* **Royalty Implementation:** A royalty percentage is included when creating the NFT, giving the artist a share of future sales.
* **Ownable Contract:** Inherits from `Ownable` to restrict certain functions (e.g., `startVotingPhase`, `endVotingPhase`) to the contract owner.  This provides a level of administrative control.
* **ERC721URIStorage:** Uses `ERC721URIStorage` to manage token metadata, allowing for easy retrieval of metadata URIs.
* **Events:** Emits events to track important actions (e.g., NFT creation, staking, evolution, voting, reward claims).  This makes it easier to monitor and track the contract's activity.
* **Reentrancy Guard:**  Implements a `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks, which can be a major security risk in smart contracts.
* **Gas Optimization Considerations:** Comments highlight areas for potential gas optimization (e.g., batch updates for `votingAllowed` and vote resets).
* **Error Handling and Requires:**  Uses `require` statements to enforce constraints and prevent errors.  Informative error messages are included.
* **Clear and Concise Code:**  The code is well-formatted and commented to improve readability and understanding.
* **Strings Library:** Includes a `Strings` library for converting `uint256` to `string`.  This is necessary for creating dynamic metadata URIs.
* **PurchaseNFT function:** includes rudimentary payment handling as part of the core function, but a more robust sales mechanism is needed

How to Use (Conceptual):

1. **Deployment:** Deploy the contract with the desired name, symbol, royalty recipient, and platform fee percentage.
2. **NFT Creation:** Artists call `createEvolvingNFT` to mint their Evolving NFTs.
3. **Staking:** Collectors call `stakeNFT` to stake their NFTs.
4. **Evolution Phases:** The contract owner calls `startVotingPhase` to begin a new voting phase.
5. **Voting:** Collectors call `vote` to vote on the evolution options for the NFTs they have staked.
6. **Mutation:** The contract owner calls `endVotingPhase` to end the voting phase and trigger the mutation process.  This updates the metadata URI, and an off-chain process (e.g., a script or service) generates new visuals based on the updated metadata.
7. **Repeat:** Steps 4-6 are repeated for each evolution phase.
8. **Claiming:** Collectors and artists claim their rewards by calling `claimRewards`.

This comprehensive example provides a solid foundation for building a decentralized dynamic art marketplace with evolving NFTs.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the contract before deploying it to a production environment.  The off-chain metadata generation and more robust sales tracking need to be implemented for a fully functional system.
