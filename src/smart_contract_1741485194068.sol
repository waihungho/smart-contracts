/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Gallery (DAAG)
 * @author Your Name (GPT-3 Model)
 * @dev A smart contract for a decentralized art gallery managed by a DAO,
 *      featuring advanced concepts like generative art NFTs, dynamic pricing,
 *      curator-led exhibitions, community governance, and decentralized storage integration.
 *
 * Outline and Function Summary:
 *
 * 1.  **Initialization & Ownership:**
 *     - `constructor(string memory _galleryName, address _initialCurator)`:  Sets up the gallery name and initial curator.
 *     - `owner()`: Returns the contract owner (DAO Admin).
 *     - `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Allows the owner to transfer contract ownership.
 *
 * 2.  **Gallery Management:**
 *     - `setGalleryName(string memory _newName)`:  Allows the owner to update the gallery name.
 *     - `addCurator(address _curator)`:  Allows the owner or DAO to add new curators.
 *     - `removeCurator(address _curator)`:  Allows the owner or DAO to remove curators.
 *     - `isCurator(address _user)`:  Checks if an address is a curator.
 *     - `setPlatformFee(uint256 _feePercentage)`: Sets the platform fee percentage for sales.
 *     - `getPlatformFee()`: Returns the current platform fee percentage.
 *     - `withdrawPlatformFees()`: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated platform fees.
 *
 * 3.  **Generative Art NFT Minting & Management:**
 *     - `mintGenerativeArtNFT(string memory _artworkTitle, string memory _artworkDescription, string memory _ipfsHash, uint256 _initialPrice)`: Allows curators to mint generative art NFTs.
 *     - `setArtworkPrice(uint256 _artworkId, uint256 _newPrice)`: Allows curators to update the price of an artwork they minted.
 *     - `getArtworkDetails(uint256 _artworkId)`: Retrieves detailed information about a specific artwork.
 *     - `transferArtworkOwnership(uint256 _artworkId, address _newOwner)`: Allows artwork owners to transfer NFT ownership.
 *     - `burnArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows the artwork owner to burn (destroy) their NFT.
 *
 * 4.  **Exhibition Management:**
 *     - `createExhibition(string memory _exhibitionTitle, uint256 _startTime, uint256 _endTime)`: Allows curators to create new exhibitions.
 *     - `addArtworkToExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to add artworks to an exhibition.
 *     - `removeArtworkFromExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId, uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows curators to remove artworks from an exhibition.
 *     - `getExhibitionDetails(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Retrieves details of a specific exhibition including artworks.
 *     - `endExhibition(uint256 _exhibitionId)`: Allows curators to manually end an exhibition before the end time.
 *
 * 5.  **Decentralized Marketplace & Sales:**
 *     - `purchaseArtwork(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows anyone to purchase an artwork listed in the gallery.
 *     - `listArtworkForSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artwork owners to list their artwork for sale in the gallery.
 *     - `unlistArtworkFromSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Allows artwork owners to unlist their artwork from sale.
 *     - `isArtworkListedForSale(uint256 _artworkId)`: Checks if an artwork is currently listed for sale.
 *
 * 6.  **Community Governance (Basic Example - Can be expanded with DAO frameworks):**
 *     - `proposeNewCurator(address _proposedCurator, string memory _reason)`: Allows members to propose new curators (basic example, could be voting based).
 *     - `voteOnCuratorProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _vote)`: Allows members to vote on curator proposals (basic example, could be token-weighted).
 *     - `executeCuratorProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the owner to execute successful curator proposals (basic execution, more advanced DAO logic needed for real governance).
 *     - `getProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Retrieves details of a curator proposal.
 *
 * 7.  **Utility & Information:**
 *     - `getGalleryName()`: Returns the name of the art gallery.
 *     - `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)`:  Standard ERC721 interface support.
 *     - `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`:  Standard ERC721 token URI function to fetch NFT metadata (points to IPFS hash).
