/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Development and Ownership.
 * @author Bard (An example AI assistant generating Solidity code)
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO specifically for the development, training, and ownership of AI models.  It allows members to propose model development projects, vote on their funding, contribute data, and collectively own the resulting AI models.  Unique aspects include dynamic data contribution weights, reputation-based voting power, and a mechanism for continuous model retraining via incentivized contributions.
 *
 * Outline:
 *  1.  Membership Management:  Allows joining and leaving the DAO.
 *  2.  Proposal Management:  Allows members to propose new AI model development projects.
 *  3.  Voting:  Allows members to vote on proposals based on reputation.
 *  4.  Data Contribution:  Allows members to contribute data for training the AI model.
 *  5.  Model Ownership & Profit Sharing:  Distributes profits generated by the AI model according to a dynamically adjusted contribution score.
 *  6.  Reputation System:  Awards reputation points based on data contribution quality, proposal success, and positive community feedback.
 *  7.  Continuous Retraining: Incentivizes members to contribute new data for ongoing model improvement.
 *
 * Function Summary:
 *  - joinDAO(): Allows a user to become a member of the DAO.
 *  - leaveDAO(): Allows a member to leave the DAO.
 *  - proposeModelDevelopment(string memory _modelName, string memory _description, uint256 _fundingGoal): Allows a member to propose a new AI model development project.
 *  - voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support): Allows a member to vote on a proposal. Voting power is based on reputation.
 *  - contributeData(uint256 _proposalId, string memory _dataUri): Allows a member to contribute data to a specific model development project.
 *  - withdrawProfits(): Allows members to withdraw their share of profits generated by the AI model.
 *  - reportDataQuality(address _contributor, uint256 _proposalId, bool _isGood): Allows members to report on the quality of data contributions, influencing reputation scores.
 *  - updateModelWeights(): A function callable by a trusted address (e.g., a multisig) to update the AI model weights based on new data and retraining.  This could trigger profit generation if the model is used and monetized.

Key Improvements and Advanced Concepts Implemented:

*   **DAO for AI Model Development & Ownership:** The core concept is to create a decentralized organization dedicated to AI.  This is inherently cutting-edge as AI and blockchain technologies are increasingly converging.
*   **Reputation-Based Voting:** Voting power isn't simply 1 vote per member. It's weighted by reputation, making those with a proven track record more influential in decision-making.
*   **Dynamic Data Contribution Weights/Contribution Score:**  The `contributionScore` allows for more sophisticated calculation of a member's relative contribution to the DAO. This factors into profit sharing. This can be enhanced to include data size, data quality, and the actual impact on the model.
*   **Continuous Retraining Incentive:**  The `updateModelWeights()` function (intended to be called via Oracle) and data contribution system promote continuous model improvement. This is crucial for AI, as models degrade over time. The `reportDataQuality()` function adds a feedback loop to further refine data and model performance.
*   **Time-Decaying Contribution Score:** `withdrawProfits()` now factors in a time-decaying contribution score.  This means older contributions have less weight than newer ones, incentivizing continuous participation and data provision.  This addresses the problem of early contributors disproportionately benefiting from the DAO's later success.
*   **Data Quality Reporting:** The `reportDataQuality()` allows members to report on the quality of data, further refining the reputation system and incentivizing good data provision.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Using calldata instead of memory where possible, caching variables.
*   **Security Considerations:** The contract includes basic checks to prevent double voting and requires minimum reputation to propose.  However, a real-world implementation should undergo thorough auditing.
*   **Events:**  Extensive use of events for off-chain monitoring and indexing.
*   **Clear Documentation:** The code includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of each function and variable.
*   **Oracle Integration (Illustrative):**  The contract *mentions* and *implies* integration with Oracles for triggering model retraining and verifying data.  This is a critical real-world component but is left abstract for simplicity, as implementing an Oracle would require a more complex setup.
*   **`lastWithdrawalTime` and `timeSinceLastWithdrawal`**:  These are used in `withdrawProfits()` to provide a time basis for adjusting contribution scores.

How this is different from existing open-source DAOs and AI-related contracts:

*   **Focus on AI Model Lifecycle:**  Most DAOs are generic.  This one is specifically designed for the unique challenges of AI, including data collection, model training, and continuous retraining.
*   **Tight Integration of Reputation and Data Contribution:** The reputation system is directly tied to data quality and contribution, creating a virtuous cycle.
*   **Time-decaying Contribution Score:** The `contributionScore` decays over time, giving advantage to recent contributors.
*   **Profit Distribution tailored for AI:** It considers the continuous and evolving nature of AI models when distributing profits.
*   **Emphasis on Data Quality:** Incorporating a data quality reporting mechanism is relatively unique and crucial for AI.

To use this contract:

1.  **Deploy:** Deploy the contract to a suitable Ethereum network.
2.  **Set Parameters:**  Set the initial membership fee, voting duration, and other parameters appropriately.
3.  **Join DAO:**  Users pay the membership fee to join.
4.  **Propose Models:** Members propose AI model development projects.
5.  **Vote:**  Members vote on proposals based on their reputation.
6.  **Contribute Data:**  If a proposal is approved, members contribute data.
7.  **(Off-Chain) Train Model:**  An off-chain process is required to train the AI model using the contributed data.
8.  **(Off-Chain) Monetize:**  The AI model is used and generates profits, deposited into the contract.
9.  **Withdraw Profits:**  Members withdraw their share of the profits.
10. **Report Data Quality:** Members report on the quality of data contributions.
11. **(Oracle) Retrain:** An Oracle monitors the model and triggers retraining.

This contract represents a more advanced and specialized DAO designed for the unique needs of AI model development and ownership. Remember that real-world AI deployments often require specialized hardware (GPUs), decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave), and Oracle services, which are beyond the scope of a single smart contract but are crucial parts of the overall architecture.  Also, data governance and privacy regulations need careful consideration.
