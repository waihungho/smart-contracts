This smart contract, "QuantumLeapDAO," envisions a decentralized autonomous organization focused on funding and governing advanced, cutting-edge research and development projects, particularly those pushing the boundaries of technology like quantum computing, AI, and novel biological sciences. It introduces a sophisticated governance model beyond simple token voting, incorporating reputation, project-based milestones, and adaptive emergency protocols.

## QuantumLeapDAO: Outline and Function Summary

**Outline:**

1.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   **QLD Token (ERC-20):** The primary governance and treasury token for the DAO.
    *   **Reputation Score (Soulbound-like):** A non-transferable score accumulated by active and valuable participation, influencing voting power and access.
    *   **Project Lifecycle Management:** Structured process for submitting, reviewing, funding, tracking milestones, and evaluating advanced research projects.
    *   **Advanced Governance System:** Multiple proposal types, weighted voting (token + reputation), emergency protocols, and specialized delegation.
    *   **Performance-Based Rewards:** Incentivizing successful project outcomes and active participation.
    *   **Adaptive Security:** Circuit breaker and upgrade mechanisms.

2.  **Key Function Categories:**
    *   **DAO Core & Treasury:** Initialization, fund management, and basic settings.
    *   **QLD Token Management:** ERC-20 standard functions.
    *   **Reputation System:** Minting, burning, and querying reputation.
    *   **Proposal & Voting System:** Creating, voting on, and executing various types of proposals.
    *   **Research Project Management:** Functions covering the entire lifecycle of funded projects.
    *   **Emergency & Security:** Safeguard mechanisms.
    *   **Advanced & Unique Features:** Performance bonuses, skill-based delegation, quantum-specific proposals.

**Function Summary:**

1.  **`constructor(string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol, uint256 _initialSupply)`**: Initializes the DAO, deploys its ERC-20 token, sets the initial administrator, and defines core governance parameters.
2.  **`depositFunds()`**: Allows anyone to deposit WETH (wrapped Ether) into the DAO's treasury, increasing its funding capacity.
3.  **`withdrawFunds(uint256 _amount)`**: Initiates a proposal for the DAO to withdraw a specified amount of WETH from its treasury. Only executable via approved governance proposal.
4.  **`setGovernanceParameters(uint256 _minVotingPeriod, uint256 _minQuorumPercentage, uint256 _minReputationForProposal, uint256 _maxReputationScalar)`**: Proposes and updates critical governance settings like voting duration, minimum voter turnout (quorum), minimum reputation required to propose, and how reputation scales vote weight.
5.  **`mintReputationPoints(address _recipient, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _reasonHash)`**: Awards non-transferable reputation points to a specific address, typically for positive contributions (e.g., successful project completion, valuable vote, bug bounty submission). Only executable via approved governance proposal.
6.  **`burnReputationPoints(address _target, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _reasonHash)`**: Revokes reputation points from an address, typically for malicious activity or failure to deliver. Only executable via approved governance proposal.
7.  **`getReputationScore(address _addr)`**: Returns the current non-transferable reputation score of a given address.
8.  **`submitResearchProposal(string memory _title, string memory _description, string memory _ipfsLink, uint256 _requestedFunding, uint256 _milestoneCount, bytes32[] memory _milestoneHashes)`**: Allows a member with sufficient reputation to submit a new research project proposal, including funding requests and a breakdown of milestones.
9.  **`voteOnFundingProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: Allows members to vote on a submitted research funding proposal. Vote weight is a combination of staked QLD tokens and reputation score.
10. **`fundProjectMilestone(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex)`**: Releases funds for a specific project milestone, *only* after it has been approved by a DAO vote (meaning the project team submitted proof and the DAO verified it).
11. **`submitMilestoneProof(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _milestoneIndex, string memory _proofIPFSLink)`**: The project team submits evidence of completing a milestone, making it available for DAO review and verification.
12. **`evaluateProjectPerformance(uint256 _projectId, uint256 _score)`**: Allows the DAO to vote on and assign a performance score (e.g., 1-100) to a completed or ongoing project, influencing future reputation and bonus distribution.
13. **`createGeneralProposal(string memory _description, bytes memory _targetCallData)`**: Allows a member to create a general-purpose DAO proposal, which can involve calling any function on the DAO contract itself (e.g., setting parameters, emergency actions) or other external contracts (e.g., interacting with an oracle).
14. **`voteOnProposal(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`**: General function for members to cast their weighted vote (token + reputation) on any active proposal.
15. **`executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`**: Executes an approved and finalized proposal, triggering the associated action (e.g., funding a project, setting new parameters).
16. **`setEmergencyMode(bool _active)`**: Activates or deactivates an emergency "circuit breaker" mode, pausing non-critical DAO operations (e.g., new proposals, project funding) until the emergency is resolved. Only callable via emergency governance proposal.
17. **`proposeSkillBasedDelegation(address _delegator, address _delegatee, string memory _skillCategory)`**: Proposes that a member delegates their vote weight *specifically* for proposals tagged with a certain "skill category" (e.g., "Quantum Physics," "AI Ethics"), leveraging specialized expertise within the DAO. This proposal needs DAO approval.
18. **`distributePerformanceBonus(uint256 _projectId)`**: Initiates the distribution of a bonus (e.g., a percentage of unused project funds, or a separate pool) to project teams that achieved high performance scores, incentivizing excellence. Only executable via approved governance proposal.
19. **`proposeQuantumCircuitDeployment(string memory _circuitDescriptionIPFS, uint256 _budget)`**: A highly specialized proposal type allowing the DAO to fund and initiate the conceptual deployment of a quantum circuit on an external (simulated or real) quantum platform, linking the DAO directly to its core mission.
20. **`proposeContractUpgrade(address _newLogicAddress)`**: Allows the DAO to propose and vote on upgrading its core logic, pointing to a new implementation contract via a proxy pattern (conceptual, requires external proxy infrastructure).
21. **`claimQLDTokens(uint256 _amount)`**: Allows users to claim their QLD tokens if they were part of a vesting schedule or a specific distribution event (not explicitly covered by constructor, but a common DAO function).
22. **`delegateVote(address _delegatee)`**: Standard ERC-20 token delegation for voting power, independent of reputation.
23. **`undelegateVote()`**: Removes any existing ERC-20 token delegation.
24. **`getVoteWeight(address _voter)`**: Calculates and returns the effective voting weight for a given address, combining staked QLD tokens and reputation score.
