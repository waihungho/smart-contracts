Okay, this is an exciting challenge! Let's build a smart contract that embodies advanced concepts, is creative, and pushes the boundaries of typical DeFi or NFT projects.

I'll propose the **"QuantumLeap Protocol"**.

**Core Concept:** The QuantumLeap Protocol is a self-evolving, adaptive DeFi primitive. It allows for dynamic economic parameters (fees, rewards, risk profiles) to be modified *on-chain* through a decentralized governance mechanism, not by an owner upgrading the contract. These modifications are called "Protocol Mutations," which can shift the entire protocol into different "Quantum States" (e.g., 'Stable', 'Expansion', 'Contraction', 'Innovation'). Users can propose these mutations, and a governance token (QLP) DAO votes on them. The contract also features a "Quantum Resonance" mechanism to reward long-term, committed participants based on dynamic loyalty tiers, and includes a conceptual "Simulation Engine" for assessing mutation impacts.

**Why it's unique & advanced:**

1.  **Self-Evolving Economic Parameters:** Instead of a fixed fee/reward structure, the contract's core economic rules are dynamic and adjustable via governance.
2.  **Quantum States:** The introduction of distinct "Protocol States" allows for a holistic shift in the protocol's behavior, not just tweaking individual parameters.
3.  **Protocol Mutations:** A structured way for the community to propose, simulate (conceptually), vote on, and execute significant changes to the protocol's core logic. This is distinct from simple parameter updates or contract upgrades. It's about *changing the rules of the game*.
4.  **Quantum Resonance:** A novel loyalty mechanism that isn't just about staking duration but also integrates user activity and protocol health.
5.  **Conceptual Simulation Engine:** While true on-chain simulation of complex economics is hard, the contract lays the groundwork for a system where parameters can be "tested" before full deployment.
6.  **No Direct Open Source Duplication:** While it uses ERC20 standards, the *mechanics* of dynamic states, protocol mutations, and quantum resonance are custom-designed for this concept, not copied from existing projects.

## QuantumLeap Protocol (QLP)

**Outline & Function Summary:**

This smart contract manages a pool of assets, dynamically adjusts its economic parameters based on its `ProtocolState`, and allows for community-driven evolution through `ProtocolMutation` proposals.

**I. Core Protocol Management & Access Control**
    *   `constructor`: Initializes owner, token addresses, and initial protocol state.
    *   `pause()`: Pauses core contract operations for emergencies.
    *   `unpause()`: Unpauses core contract operations.
    *   `ownerWithdrawEmergency(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Emergency withdrawal of any stuck tokens by the owner.
    *   `setProtocolCouncil(address _councilAddress)`: Sets the address of the DAO/multisig responsible for governance decisions.

**II. Quantum State Management**
    *   `ProtocolState`: An enum defining various operational states (e.g., `Stable`, `Expansion`, `Contraction`, `Innovation`).
    *   `currentProtocolState()`: Returns the current active `ProtocolState`.
    *   `updateStateParameters(ProtocolState _state, uint256 _depositFeeBps, uint256 _withdrawalFeeBps, uint256 _fluxRewardMultiplier, uint256 _resonanceMultiplier)`: Allows `ProtocolCouncil` to set parameters for a specific `ProtocolState`.
    *   `getProtocolStateParameters(ProtocolState _state)`: Returns the economic parameters associated with a given `ProtocolState`.

**III. Protocol Mutation & Governance (QLP DAO)**
    *   `ProtocolMutationProposal`: Struct to hold details of a proposed change.
    *   `proposeProtocolMutation(ProtocolState _newState, uint256 _proposedDepositFeeBps, uint256 _proposedWithdrawalFeeBps, uint256 _proposedFluxRewardMultiplier, uint256 _proposedResonanceMultiplier, uint256 _votingPeriodSeconds)`: Users can propose a new `ProtocolState` and its associated economic parameters. Requires QLP stake.
    *   `voteOnMutation(uint256 _proposalId, bool _support)`: QLP holders vote on a specific mutation proposal.
    *   `executeMutation(uint256 _proposalId)`: Executes a successfully voted-on mutation, transitioning the protocol to the new state and applying its parameters.
    *   `cancelMutationProposal(uint256 _proposalId)`: Allows the proposer or council to cancel an active proposal under certain conditions.
    *   `getMutationProposalDetails(uint256 _proposalId)`: Returns the details of a specific mutation proposal.
    *   `getLatestProposalId()`: Returns the ID of the most recent proposal.

**IV. Asset & Liquidity Management**
    *   `depositAssets(address _assetToken, uint256 _amount)`: Users deposit supported assets into the protocol. Dynamic deposit fees apply.
    *   `withdrawAssets(address _assetToken, uint256 _amount)`: Users withdraw their deposited assets. Dynamic withdrawal fees apply.
    *   `getUserDeposit(address _user, address _assetToken)`: Returns the amount of a specific asset deposited by a user.
    *   `getTotalTVL(address _assetToken)`: Returns the total value locked for a specific asset.
    *   `getAvailableLiquidity(address _assetToken)`: Returns the amount of a specific asset available for withdrawal in the contract.

**V. Dynamic Fee & Reward Mechanism**
    *   `calculateDynamicDepositFee(uint256 _amount)`: Calculates the current deposit fee based on `currentProtocolState`.
    *   `calculateDynamicWithdrawalFee(uint256 _amount)`: Calculates the current withdrawal fee based on `currentProtocolState`.
    *   `claimFluxRewards()`: Users claim accumulated `Flux` tokens as rewards based on their activity and `currentProtocolState`'s reward multiplier.
    *   `distributeFluxRewards()`: (Internal/Callable by specific roles) Triggers distribution of Flux rewards to active participants.

**VI. Quantum Resonance (Loyalty & Engagement)**
    *   `enterResonancePool(uint256 _qlpAmount, uint256 _lockDuration)`: Users lock QLP tokens for a duration to enter the Resonance Pool, earning higher `Flux` rewards.
    *   `exitResonancePool(uint256 _resonanceId)`: Allows users to unlock their QLP from the Resonance Pool after the lock duration.
    *   `claimResonanceBonus(uint256 _resonanceId)`: Claims additional `Flux` rewards earned from Quantum Resonance.
    *   `getResonanceDetails(uint256 _resonanceId)`: Returns details about a user's resonance lock.
    *   `calculateResonanceBonus(uint256 _resonanceId)`: Calculates the current bonus for a specific resonance lock based on `currentProtocolState`'s resonance multiplier.

**VII. Conceptual Simulation Engine**
    *   `simulateMutationImpact(ProtocolState _proposedState)`: Conceptually simulates the impact of transitioning to a `_proposedState` based on its parameters (returns estimated fee/reward changes). *Note: True complex economic simulation on-chain is prohibitive; this would be a simplified estimation.*
    *   `getSimulatedOutcome(ProtocolState _state)`: Returns the (pre-calculated or simplified) simulated outcome parameters for a given state.
