Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract concept called `QuantumVault`. It's designed with advanced, multi-faceted access control and state-dependent logic inspired by concepts like "entanglement" and "observation" (used metaphorically for complex state dependencies and triggers), going beyond standard time locks or single-condition releases. It aims for over 20 functions by providing detailed control and query methods.

**Concept:**

The `QuantumVault` holds various assets (ETH, ERC20, ERC721). Access to these assets is governed not just by ownership or simple time locks, but by complex, user-defined *conditions*. These conditions can be based on time, external oracle reports, or even the state resolution of *other* conditions within the vault (the "entanglement" concept). Assets can be put into a conceptual "superposition state" upon deposit, where their availability is uncertain until a specific "observation" event (a transaction checking and confirming the linked condition's state).

**Advanced Concepts Used:**

1.  **Multi-Asset Holding:** Manages ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 in a unified contract.
2.  **Complex Conditional Release:** Assets released based on user-defined rules (time, oracle, state dependencies).
3.  **Oracle Integration (Abstracted):** Designed to interact with an external oracle contract to verify conditions.
4.  **State Entanglement (Conceptual):** Conditions can be linked, where the met state of one condition influences the met state of another, affecting asset access.
5.  **Observation-Based State Resolution:** Assets linked to conditions might require an explicit "observation" transaction to finalize their availability state after the condition is met.
6.  **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Potential for function-level or user-specific access requirements based on holding other tokens.
7.  **Detailed Querying:** Numerous view functions to inspect the complex state.

**Outline:**

1.  Pragma and Imports.
2.  Error Definitions.
3.  Event Definitions.
4.  Interfaces (for Oracle, ERC20, ERC721).
5.  Enums for Asset Types and Condition Types.
6.  Structs for Conditions, Entanglement Links, Access Requirements.
7.  State Variables (Balances, Holdings, Conditions, Entanglements, Locks, Access Rules, Oracle Address, State Flags).
8.  Modifiers (Ownable, Pausable, Custom Access).
9.  Constructor.
10. Deposit Functions (ETH, ERC20, ERC721).
11. Withdrawal Functions (Conditional, Time-Locked Release, Standard/Unconditional - with checks).
12. Condition Management Functions (Define, Cancel, Check State).
13. Entanglement Management Functions (Create, Break).
14. State Observation Function.
15. Access Requirement Management Functions.
16. Time Lock Management Function.
17. Oracle Interaction Functions.
18. Admin Functions (Pause, Ownership).
19. View/Query Functions (Balances, Conditions, Entanglements, Locks, States, Access).
20. Fallback/Receive (for ETH deposits).

**Function Summary (Targeting >= 20):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes owner and potentially pauses.
2.  `receive()`: Handles incoming Ether deposits.
3.  `depositEther()`: Explicit function for clarity on Ether deposit.
4.  `depositERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Deposits specified ERC20 tokens.
5.  `depositERC721(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId)`: Deposits specified ERC721 token.
6.  `defineConditionalWithdrawal(...)`: Sets up a complex condition for releasing specific assets. Returns a unique condition ID.
7.  `cancelConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 conditionId)`: Cancels a pending conditional withdrawal (requires specific permissions).
8.  `attemptConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 conditionId)`: Attempts to withdraw assets linked to a condition if it's met and observed.
9.  `createEntanglementLink(uint256 conditionId1, uint256 conditionId2)`: Links two conditions; meeting one can influence the state check of the other.
10. `breakEntanglementLink(uint256 entanglementId)`: Removes an existing entanglement link.
11. `observeConditionState(uint256 conditionId)`: Explicitly checks and potentially updates the *internal recorded state* of a condition based on the oracle or time. This is the "observation" that might resolve a "superposition".
12. `setTimeLock(AssetType assetType, address tokenAddress, uint256 amountOrId, uint256 unlockTimestamp)`: Sets a time lock on deposited assets.
13. `releaseTimeLockedAssets(AssetType assetType, address tokenAddress, uint256 amountOrId)`: Releases assets only when the time lock has expired AND no unresolved condition/entanglement/observation state is pending for that asset.
14. `withdrawUnconditional(AssetType assetType, address tokenAddress, uint256 amountOrId)`: Allows withdrawal of assets *not* linked to any active condition or time lock, and whose state is fully resolved.
15. `setAccessRequirement(address user, AccessRequirement memory requirement)`: Owner sets a token-holding requirement for a specific user to interact with certain contract functions.
16. `removeAccessRequirement(address user)`: Owner removes a user's access requirement.
17. `setOracleAddress(address _oracleAddress)`: Owner sets the address of the trusted oracle contract.
18. `reportOracleConditionState(uint256 conditionId, bool state)`: Function callable *only* by the designated oracle to report the outcome of an off-chain condition check.
19. `getEthBalance(address user)`: View: Gets the Ether balance of a user in the vault.
20. `getERC20Balance(address user, address tokenAddress)`: View: Gets ERC20 balance of a user in the vault.
21. `getERC721Tokens(address user, address tokenAddress)`: View: Lists ERC721 token IDs held for a user/token. (Requires iteration, can be gas-intensive, but fulfills requirement).
22. `getConditionalWithdrawalDetails(uint256 conditionId)`: View: Gets details of a defined condition.
23. `getEntanglementDetails(uint256 entanglementId)`: View: Gets details of an entanglement link.
24. `isConditionMet(uint256 conditionId)`: Internal/View: Checks if a condition's criteria are currently met (based on time or oracle report).
25. `getConditionObservedState(uint256 conditionId)`: View: Checks if a condition's state has been observed via `observeConditionState` or `attemptConditionalWithdrawal`.
26. `getAssetLockStatus(address user, AssetType assetType, address tokenAddress, uint256 amountOrId)`: View: Checks if a specific asset amount/ID for a user is locked by a condition or time lock.
27. `checkUserAccess(address user)`: View: Checks if a user meets their defined access requirement.
28. `pause()`: Owner pauses contract (inherits Pausable).
29. `unpause()`: Owner unpauses contract (inherits Pausable).
30. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Owner transfers ownership (inherits Ownable).
31. `renounceOwnership()`: Owner renounces ownership (inherits Ownable).

*(Note: Some view functions checking mappings might be included directly in the contract logic rather than exposed externally if they are simple lookups. The count is based on the distinct actions and state queries provided)*

**Explanation of Key Parts:**

1.  **Asset Handling:** Uses separate mappings for ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 balances/holdings, which is standard. ERC721 uses `ERC721Holder` to receive tokens via `safeTransferFrom`.
2.  **`Condition` Struct:** Captures all the parameters needed for a conditional withdrawal, including the asset, the recipient, the type of condition, and specific parameters. The `entangledConditionId` field (added during the thought process refinement) is key for the entanglement feature. `requiresObservationToResolve` adds the "superposition" concept.
3.  **`EntanglementLink` Struct:** Simply links two condition IDs and notes the creator.
4.  **`AccessRequirement` Struct:** Defines a prerequisite (holding a minimum of a token or specific NFT outside the vault) for a user to call certain functions.
5.  **`timeLocks` Mapping:** Tracks when a specific asset amount/ID for a user becomes eligible for time-locked release.
6.  **`assetLockedByCondition` and `assetLockedByTimeLock`:** These mappings are crucial for ensuring that assets tied to active conditions or time locks cannot be withdrawn via other means (like `withdrawUnconditional`) until the lock is removed (by fulfilling/cancelling the condition, or time expiring). This adds a layer of state management.
7.  **`IConditionOracle` Interface:** Abstracting the oracle interaction allows the contract to rely on external logic for condition checking without needing to know the oracle's internal implementation.
8.  **`isConditionMet` Function:** This is the heart of the conditional logic, handling the different `ConditionType` checks (time, oracle report, entanglement). For OracleBased, it checks the internal `_oracleReportedState` mapping, which is updated *only* by the trusted oracle. For EntanglementBased, it recursively calls `isConditionMet` on the linked condition.
9.  **`reportOracleConditionState`:** This function is the designated entry point for the oracle to provide off-chain data results. It's restricted to `msg.sender == address(oracle)`.
10. **`observeConditionState`:** This function implements the "observation" concept. A user calls this to check a condition's status *at that specific moment*. If the condition is met *and* the condition was defined with `requiresObservationToResolve = true`, the internal `_conditionStateObserved` flag for that condition ID is set. `attemptConditionalWithdrawal` then requires this flag to be true (in addition to `isConditionMet` being true) if observation was required.
11. **`attemptConditionalWithdrawal`:** This function is the trigger for conditional release. It checks `isConditionMet`, `_conditionStateObserved` (if required), and the asset lock statuses before performing the withdrawal.
12. **`createEntanglementLink`:** Links two conditions (currently restricted to `OracleBased` for logical consistency in `isConditionMet`) by updating their `entangledConditionId` fields mutually.
13. **`hasRequiredAccess` Modifier:** Enforces the `accessRequirements` mapping before executing a function. It checks the user's balance/holding *outside* the vault.
14. **View Functions:** A comprehensive set of view functions allows users to inspect the state of their balances, defined conditions, entanglements, locks, and access requirements. `getERC721Tokens` is noted as potentially inefficient.

This contract provides a framework for managing assets with complex, interconnected, state-dependent release mechanisms, offering a unique take on vault functionalities by incorporating concepts like 'observation' and 'entanglement' as metaphors for structured state resolution and linked conditions. Remember that deploying such a complex contract requires thorough testing and auditing.
