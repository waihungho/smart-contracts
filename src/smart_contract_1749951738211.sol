Okay, let's design a smart contract for a **Decentralized Autonomous Artist DAO (DAADAO)**.

This DAO will govern collaborative or community-funded art projects. It will feature:

1.  **Token-Based Membership & Governance:** Members stake tokens to participate.
2.  **Flexible Proposals:** Proposals can fund artists, commission work, acquire art, or change DAO parameters.
3.  **Stake + Reputation Voting:** Voting power is influenced by both staked tokens and a dynamic reputation score.
4.  **Dynamic Reputation System:** Reputation increases with constructive participation (voting on successful proposals, submitting successful proposals) and decreases (or decays) with inactivity or failed proposals.
5.  **Integrated NFT Management:** The DAO can trigger the minting or management of related art NFTs through successful proposals.
6.  **Treasury Management:** Control over DAO funds (ETH and potentially other tokens).

This combines elements of DAOs, reputation systems, and NFT interaction in a specific artistic context, aiming to be distinct from standard Governor/NFT contracts.

### Contract Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `DecentralizedAutonomousArtistDao`

**Purpose:** A DAO to collectively govern art projects, treasury, and associated NFTs, utilizing a reputation-enhanced voting system.

**Key Concepts:**
*   **Staking:** Members stake governance tokens (`ART_TOKEN`) for voting power and membership.
*   **Reputation:** A dynamic score influencing voting power and potentially proposal thresholds. Earned through participation.
*   **Proposals:** Flexible proposals for funding, actions, parameter changes, and NFT management.
*   **Voting:** Weighted voting based on staked tokens and reputation.
*   **Execution:** Successful proposals can trigger actions, including external contract calls or internal NFT minting/transfers.
*   **Treasury:** Manages collective funds (ETH and potentially other assets).

**External/Public Functions:**

1.  `constructor(address _artTokenAddress, address _artNFTAddress, uint256 _initialGovernorReputation)`: Initializes the DAO with token/NFT addresses and sets the initial governor.
2.  `receive() external payable`: Allows the contract to receive Ether into its treasury.
3.  `stakeTokens(uint256 amount)`: Stakes `ART_TOKEN` for membership and voting power.
4.  `unstakeTokens(uint256 amount)`: Unstakes `ART_TOKEN` after an optional cooldown period (not implemented in detail here for brevity, but good practice).
5.  `grantMembership(address member)`: Grants membership directly (callable by Governor or via proposal).
6.  `revokeMembership(address member)`: Revokes membership (callable by Governor or via proposal).
7.  `submitProposal(string memory title, string memory description, address target, uint256 value, bytes memory callData, uint256 requiredStakeThreshold, uint256 requiredReputationThreshold)`: Submits a new governance proposal. Requires meeting stake and reputation thresholds.
8.  `cancelProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Cancels a proposal if it hasn't started voting, or if the proposer meets conditions (e.g., high reputation).
9.  `castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support)`: Casts a vote (For=1, Against=0, Abstain=2) on an active proposal. Voting power is calculated based on stake and reputation.
10. `delegateVote(address delegatee)`: Delegates voting power to another address.
11. `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`: Executes a successful and queued proposal after the voting period ends and execution delay passes.
12. `setVotingPeriod(uint256 duration)`: Sets the duration of the voting period (Governor controlled).
13. `setQuorumPercentage(uint256 percentage)`: Sets the percentage of total voting power required for quorum (Governor controlled).
14. `setProposalThresholdStake(uint256 amount)`: Sets the minimum staked tokens required to submit a proposal (Governor controlled).
15. `setMinReputationBound(uint256 rep)`: Sets the minimum bound for reputation (Governor controlled).
16. `setMaxReputationBound(uint256 rep)`: Sets the maximum bound for reputation (Governor controlled).
17. `setGovernor(address newGovernor)`: Transfers the Governor role (current Governor only).
18. `withdrawTreasuryFunds(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Initiates a treasury withdrawal (only via successful proposal).

**View Functions:**

19. `isMember(address account) view`: Checks if an address is a member.
20. `getMemberStake(address account) view`: Gets the staked token amount for an address.
21. `getTotalStakedTokens() view`: Gets the total staked tokens in the DAO.
22. `getMemberReputation(address account) view`: Gets the reputation score for an address.
23. `getVotingPower(address account) view`: Calculates the current voting power for an address.
24. `getProposalDetails(uint256 proposalId) view`: Gets details of a specific proposal.
25. `getProposalState(uint256 proposalId) view`: Gets the current state of a proposal.
26. `getDaoParameters() view`: Gets key DAO configuration parameters.
27. `getTreasuryBalance() view`: Gets the current Ether balance of the DAO treasury.
28. `getDaoArtNFTAddress() view`: Gets the address of the associated ART_NFT contract.
29. `getDaoArtTokenAddress() view`: Gets the address of the associated ART_TOKEN contract.

**Internal/Private Functions (Not counted towards the 20+ external functions):**

*   `_updateReputation(address account, int256 change)`: Internal function to adjust reputation score.
*   `_calculateVotingPower(address account, uint256 blockNumber) internal view`: Calculates voting power based on stake and reputation at a specific block (or current).
*   `_state(uint256 proposalId) internal view`: Internal helper to determine proposal state.
*   `_isQuorumReached(uint256 proposalId) internal view`: Internal helper to check if quorum is met.
*   `_isMajorityAttained(uint256 proposalId) internal view`: Internal helper to check if majority is met.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Aspects:**

1.  **Reputation-Enhanced Voting:** Voting power isn't solely based on staked tokens (`ART_TOKEN`) but also on a dynamic `reputation` score (`getVotingPower`). This encourages active participation and positive contributions to the DAO, as reputation is updated based on actions like voting (`castVote`) and successful proposals (`executeProposal`). The `REPUTATION_FACTOR` allows tuning how much reputation impacts voting power relative to stake.
2.  **Dynamic Reputation System:** The `reputation` score isn't static. It can be increased (`_updateReputation` is called internally) based on successful actions within the DAO. While the example implementation is simple (+1 for voting, +50 for successful proposal), this system could be expanded to reward curation, discussion participation (via off-chain integration + oracle), or other positive behaviors, while potentially penalizing malicious or inactive behavior. It's bounded by `minReputationBound` and `maxReputationBound`.
3.  **Integrated NFT Management (Conceptual via `callData`):** The DAO contract holds the address of an `IDAOArtNFT` contract. Proposals (`submitProposal`, `executeProposal`) can be structured to call specific functions on the NFT contract (e.g., a custom `daoMint`, `daoUpdateTokenURI`). This allows the DAO to collectively decide on and trigger the creation, update, or transfer of art NFTs managed by the community. The `associatedNFTId` in the `Proposal` struct provides a way to link a proposal to a specific NFT produced as a result.
4.  **Flexible Proposal Execution:** Using `target.call{value: proposal.value}(proposal.callData)` in `executeProposal` allows proposals to trigger almost any arbitrary action, including sending ETH from the treasury (`withdrawTreasuryFunds`), calling functions on the `ART_TOKEN` or `ART_NFT` contracts, or even calling parameter-setting functions (`setVotingPeriod`, etc.) if they have the `onlyGovernor` modifier and the DAO contract is set as the Governor.
5.  **Non-Standard Governor Pattern:** While inspired by concepts from standard Governor contracts (proposals, voting periods, quorum, execution), this contract implements the logic directly, allowing for the integration of the custom reputation system without relying on complex libraries designed for snapshot-based token voting. This fulfills the "don't duplicate open source" aspect by creating a novel combination of features.

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Reentrancy:** `ReentrancyGuard` is used, especially on `stakeTokens`, `unstakeTokens`, and `executeProposal` to prevent reentrancy attacks during token transfers or external calls.
*   **Call Safety:** The `call` function in `executeProposal` is powerful. A malicious proposal could call a harmful contract. The DAO relies on the voting process to filter such proposals. Value/callData should be carefully reviewed by voters.
*   **Voting Power Snapshot:** The current `getVotingPower` and `_calculateVotingPower` use the *current* stake and reputation. For robustness, especially against flash loan attacks influencing quorum or voting outcome, voting power should be snapshotted at the block the proposal starts. This requires implementing a checkpoint system for stake and reputation, which adds complexity (like OpenZeppelin's `Governor` and `ERC20Votes` contracts). The current simplified version is vulnerable to this.
*   **Access Control:** The `governor` role is critical. Transferring it (`setGovernor`) must be secure, ideally also via a successful proposal itself targeting `setGovernor` (making the DAO the governor effectively).
*   **Quorum Calculation:** The simplified quorum calculation based on `totalStakedTokens` is a proxy. A true quorum needs to measure against the *total possible voting power* at the time the proposal became active.
*   **Reputation Manipulation:** Simple reputation systems can be gamed. The current system rewards *any* voting. A more advanced system might only reward voting on the winning side, or require a minimum reputation to *influence* voting power significantly.

This contract provides a framework for a unique DAO structure with a focus on community reputation and integrated artistic workflows. It has more than 20 public/external functions as requested, covering the lifecycle of membership, proposals, voting, execution, and configuration.
