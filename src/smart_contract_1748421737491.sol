Okay, let's design a smart contract that incorporates several advanced and creative concepts beyond standard token or simple DeFi patterns. We'll create an "Adaptive Yield Synthesizer" (AYS) that takes deposits, issues a yield-bearing synthetic token, dynamically manages simulated strategies, allows conditional withdrawals, offers unique flash loans on potential yield, and integrates NFT-based boosts.

This contract is complex and demonstrates various Solidity features, access control patterns, conditional logic, and interaction modeling without relying on external protocols (by simulating yield and strategies).

### **Adaptive Yield Synthesizer (AYS)**

#### **Outline**

1.  **Title:** Adaptive Yield Synthesizer (AYS)
2.  **Description:** A contract that accepts a base asset (e.g., WETH) and issues a synthetic, yield-bearing token (sWETH). The contract simulates dynamic yield generation strategies, allows users to set conditions for withdrawal, enables flash loans based on the vault's potential yield, integrates optional NFT-based boosts, and uses a role-based access control system.
3.  **Core Concepts:**
    *   Yield-Bearing Synthetic Token (sWETH)
    *   Dynamic Simulated Strategies
    *   Conditional Withdrawals
    *   Flash Loans on Potential Yield
    *   NFT Integration for Boosts
    *   Role-Based Access Control
    *   Simulated External Data (Oracle)
4.  **Key Features:**
    *   Deposit base asset, mint sWETH representing a share of total assets.
    *   Withdraw base asset by burning sWETH.
    *   Simulate yield accrual dynamically based on strategy and time/trigger.
    *   Manager can change yield strategies.
    *   Manager can trigger simulated rebalancing.
    *   Users can request withdrawals that only execute when predefined conditions are met.
    *   Users can take flash loans of a calculated amount related to the vault's yield potential, repaying within the same transaction.
    *   Holders of a specific NFT can receive boosts (e.g., increased yield accrual share, reduced fees).
    *   Dynamic fees based on state or oracle data.
    *   Pause/Unpause functionality.
    *   Emergency shutdown for asset recovery.
    *   Protocol-owned yield accrual.
5.  **Dependencies:**
    *   OpenZeppelin Contracts (for ERC20, ERC721 interfaces, AccessControl, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable inheritance for simplicity but using AccessControl mostly).

#### **Function Summary**

1.  `constructor`: Initializes contract with base asset, sWETH token details, initial roles, and optional NFT boost contract.
2.  `deposit(uint256 amount)`: Allows users to deposit the base asset and receive sWETH. Applies deposit fees.
3.  `withdraw(uint256 swethAmount)`: Allows users to burn sWETH and receive the equivalent amount of base assets. Applies withdrawal fees.
4.  `totalAssets() view`: Returns the total value of assets held by the vault (base asset balance + simulated accrued yield).
5.  `swethTotalSupply() view`: Returns the total supply of sWETH tokens.
6.  `pricePerShare() view`: Returns the current value of one sWETH token in base assets (`totalAssets() / swethTotalSupply()`).
7.  `generateSimulatedYield()`: (Manager Role) Manually triggers the simulation of yield generation, increasing `totalAssets`.
8.  `setYieldStrategy(uint8 strategyId)`: (Manager Role) Sets the active simulated yield strategy. Different strategies imply different yield generation rates or fee structures (simulated internally).
9.  `rebalanceStrategy()`: (Manager Role) Simulates a rebalancing operation, potentially adjusting internal yield generation parameters based on the current strategy.
10. `setFees(uint16 depositFeeBasisPoints, uint16 withdrawalFeeBasisPoints)`: (Manager Role) Sets the deposit and withdrawal fee percentages (in basis points).
11. `setNFTBoostContract(address nftContractAddress)`: (Manager Role) Sets the address of the NFT contract used for boosts.
12. `requestConditionalWithdrawal(uint256 swethAmount, ConditionalWithdrawalConditions conditions)`: Allows a user to request a withdrawal that will only be executable when specified conditions are met.
13. `cancelConditionalWithdrawal(bytes32 requestId)`: Allows a user to cancel a previously requested conditional withdrawal.
14. `executeConditionalWithdrawal(bytes32 requestId)`: Allows the user (or anyone, depending on design choice - let's make it callable by anyone to allow helpers/bots) to trigger a conditional withdrawal if its conditions are met.
15. `flashYieldLoan(uint256 baseAmountToBorrow, address receiver)`: Allows a user to borrow a calculated amount of the base asset (related to potential yield) under flash loan terms. Must be repaid with a premium within the same transaction.
16. `onFlashYieldLoanRepay(address caller, uint256 loanAmount, uint256 feeAmount, bytes calldata data) returns (bytes4)`: Flash loan callback function interface required for receivers. Implemented internally.
17. `setOracleData(uint256 data)`: (Oracle Updater Role) Sets simulated external data that can influence fees or strategies.
18. `getOracleData() view`: Returns the current simulated oracle data.
19. `pause()`: (Pauser Role) Pauses certain contract operations (deposit, withdrawal, flash loans).
20. `unpause()`: (Pauser Role) Unpauses the contract.
21. `emergencyShutdown()`: (Owner Role) Allows the owner to trigger an emergency state where users can withdraw assets without fees or conditions.
22. `claimProtocolYield()`: (Manager Role) Allows the manager to claim the yield accrued specifically for the protocol's share.
23. `grantRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: (Admin Role) Grants a role to an account.
24. `revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account)`: (Admin Role) Revokes a role from an account.
25. `hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) view`: Checks if an account has a specific role.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative/Trendy Concepts:**

1.  **Yield-Bearing Synthetic Token (sWETH):** Standard in DeFi vaults, but the *adaptive* nature of how its value accrues through dynamic strategies is the key. The sWETH token represents a share of the *total value* (`_totalAssets`) managed by the vault, which includes both the base asset balance and the simulated accrued yield.
2.  **Dynamic Simulated Strategies:** The `currentStrategyId` and the internal `_generateSimulatedYield` function allow the contract to behave differently based on configuration. While simulated here for self-containment, in a real application, this would involve interacting with various external DeFi protocols (lending, staking, AMMs) to achieve different yield profiles. `rebalanceStrategy` would manage asset allocation between these protocols. This brings the "adaptive" element to the yield generation.
3.  **Conditional Withdrawals:** Users can lock their funds until specific on-chain conditions are met (e.g., a certain time passes, the `pricePerShare` reaches a threshold). This adds a layer of programmable liquidity management, useful for vesting, time-locks, or speculative exits based on vault performance. Storing requests and allowing public execution enables a decentralized execution layer (anyone can trigger if conditions are met).
4.  **Flash Loans on Potential Yield:** This is a novel concept. Instead of just loaning the raw base asset, the flash loan amount is conceptually linked to the vault's value. While the code loans the actual `baseAsset`, the idea is that a user could potentially borrow against the *expected* future value or yield. The premium structure is standard flash loan, but applying it to a dynamic, yield-generating context is interesting. The simulation calculates the loan amount based on requested `baseAmountToBorrow` but the *context* implies it's borrowing "from the yield pool".
5.  **NFT Integration for Boosts:** Owning a specific ERC721 can modify user interactions (e.g., reduced fees). This links digital collectibles/membership tokens to utility within a DeFi-like protocol, a growing trend in Web3. The implementation here is a simple fee discount, but could be extended to yield boosts, governance rights, or access to special strategies.
6.  **Simulated External Data (Oracle):** The `simulatedOracleData` variable allows mimicking the impact of external data feeds (like asset prices, volatility indices, gas prices) on the protocol's behavior (e.g., influencing yield strategy outcomes or fees), demonstrating how oracles can make contracts dynamic.
7.  **Role-Based Access Control:** Using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` provides fine-grained control over who can perform sensitive operations (managing strategies, fees, pausing, updating oracle data) beyond simple ownership. This is crucial for managing complex protocols.
8.  **Protocol-Owned Yield:** Explicitly tracking `_protocolYieldShare` allows the protocol itself to accrue value, which can be claimed by the manager or used for other protocol purposes (e.g., treasury, buybacks).

This contract structure provides a foundation for building more complex, dynamic, and interactive DeFi protocols by combining multiple concepts into a single system. Remember, this is a conceptual example and would require rigorous testing, optimization, and auditing for production use, especially the simulation logic and economic models.
