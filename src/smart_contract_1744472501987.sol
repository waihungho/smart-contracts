/**
 * @title Dynamic Reputation-Based NFT Platform Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a dynamic NFT platform where NFTs evolve and gain utility based on user reputation and platform activities.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 * 1. **NFT Management:**
 *    - `mintNFT`: Mints a new NFT with initial metadata and attributes.
 *    - `transferNFT`: Transfers ownership of an NFT.
 *    - `burnNFT`: Burns (destroys) an NFT.
 *    - `getNFTMetadata`: Retrieves metadata of a specific NFT.
 *    - `updateNFTMetadata`: Updates the metadata of an NFT (platform admin only).
 *
 * 2. **Reputation System:**
 *    - `increaseReputation`: Increases a user's reputation based on platform actions (e.g., participation, staking, etc.).
 *    - `decreaseReputation`: Decreases a user's reputation (e.g., for violations, inactivity).
 *    - `getReputation`: Retrieves a user's reputation score.
 *    - `setReputationThreshold`: Sets reputation thresholds for different platform features (admin only).
 *
 * 3. **Dynamic NFT Evolution:**
 *    - `evolveNFT`: Evolves an NFT to a new stage based on user reputation or platform events.
 *    - `triggerNFTEvent`: Triggers a platform-wide event that can affect NFT attributes or utility.
 *    - `checkNFTEligibility`: Checks if an NFT is eligible for evolution based on reputation and other conditions.
 *
 * 4. **Utility and Features:**
 *    - `stakeNFT`: Allows users to stake NFTs for platform benefits (e.g., increased reputation gain, access to features).
 *    - `unstakeNFT`: Allows users to unstake NFTs.
 *    - `getNFTStakingStatus`: Checks staking status of an NFT.
 *    - `claimStakingRewards`: Allows users to claim rewards from staking (if any).
 *    - `enableFeatureForReputation`: Enables a specific platform feature for users with sufficient reputation.
 *    - `disableFeatureForReputation`: Disables a platform feature for users below a certain reputation.
 *    - `isFeatureEnabledForUser`: Checks if a feature is enabled for a specific user based on their reputation.
 *
 * 5. **Platform Governance (Simple):**
 *    - `proposeParameterChange`: Allows users with high reputation to propose changes to platform parameters (e.g., fees, thresholds).
 *    - `voteOnProposal`: Allows users with sufficient reputation to vote on proposed parameter changes.
 *    - `executeProposal`: Executes a proposal if it reaches a quorum and passes (admin only).
 *
 * 6. **Platform Management:**
 *    - `setPlatformFee`: Sets the platform fee for certain actions (admin only).
 *    - `withdrawFees`: Allows the platform owner to withdraw accumulated fees (admin only).
 *    - `pausePlatform`: Pauses certain platform functionalities (admin only - emergency use).
 *    - `unpausePlatform`: Resumes platform functionalities (admin only).
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 * - **NFT Management:** Mint, Transfer, Burn, Get Metadata, Update Metadata.
 * - **Reputation:** Increase, Decrease, Get, Set Threshold.
 * - **Dynamic Evolution:** Evolve, Trigger Event, Check Eligibility.
 * - **Utility:** Stake, Unstake, Staking Status, Claim Rewards, Enable Feature, Disable Feature, Is Feature Enabled.
 * - **Governance:** Propose Change, Vote Proposal, Execute Proposal.
 * - **Platform Management:** Set Fee, Withdraw Fees, Pause, Unpause.

**Explanation of Concepts and Creativity:**

1.  **Dynamic Reputation-Based NFTs:** The core concept is that NFTs are not static. Their utility, attributes, and even evolution are tied to the user's reputation within the platform. This adds a layer of gamification and user engagement.

2.  **Reputation System:**  The contract includes a basic reputation system. Reputation can be earned through platform participation (you'd need to add logic for *how* reputation is earned in real use cases, e.g., staking, completing tasks, etc.). Reputation gates access to features and NFT evolution.

3.  **NFT Evolution:**  NFTs can "evolve" to new stages. This is triggered by the NFT owner meeting reputation requirements. Evolution can change metadata, unlock new utilities for the NFT, or even visually alter the NFT (if metadata is used to render visuals off-chain).

4.  **Platform Events:** The `triggerNFTEvent` function allows the platform owner to trigger events that can dynamically affect NFTs across the platform. This could be used for seasonal events, game-like mechanics, or reacting to external data (if integrated with oracles).

5.  **Utility Gating with Reputation:** Features like proposing governance changes or using advanced functionalities are gated by reputation thresholds. This encourages positive platform engagement to unlock more features.

6.  **Simple On-Chain Governance:**  The contract includes a very basic proposal and voting system. Users with sufficient reputation can propose changes to platform parameters (like fees), and other reputable users can vote.

7.  **Staking (Basic):** The `stakeNFT` and `unstakeNFT` functions introduce a staking mechanism. While reward logic is not fully implemented (left as a placeholder), the idea is that staking can provide benefits like increased reputation gain or access to exclusive features.

8.  **Feature Enable/Disable by Reputation:** The `enableFeatureForReputation` and `disableFeatureForReputation` functions allow the platform owner to dynamically control access to features based on reputation thresholds.

**Advanced and Trendy Aspects:**

*   **Dynamic NFTs:**  Moving beyond static NFTs to NFTs that can change and evolve is a growing trend in the NFT space.
*   **Reputation Systems:**  Decentralized reputation is a key component of many Web3 applications, used for governance, access control, and incentivizing positive behavior.
*   **Gamification:**  Integrating game-like mechanics (like reputation and evolution) into NFT platforms can increase user engagement and retention.
*   **Simple On-Chain Governance:** Even basic governance mechanisms empower users and move towards decentralization.

**Number of Functions:**

The contract has more than 20 functions, fulfilling that requirement.

**No Duplication of Open Source:**

While the individual components (NFT minting, transfer, basic reputation) are common concepts in smart contracts, the *combination* of dynamic NFTs evolving based on a reputation system, platform events, utility gating, and simple on-chain governance creates a unique and more advanced concept that is not a direct copy of any single common open-source contract.

**Important Notes and Further Development:**

*   **Security:** This is a simplified example. In a real-world application, thorough security audits are crucial. Consider reentrancy attacks, access control vulnerabilities, and gas optimization.
*   **Scalability:**  For a large-scale platform, iterating through all NFTs in `triggerNFTEvent` would be inefficient. Consider using indexing or more optimized data structures.
*   **Gas Optimization:**  Solidity contracts can be optimized for gas costs. Consider using storage sparingly, using efficient data types, and optimizing loops.
*   **Off-Chain Integration:**  For real dynamic NFTs and visuals, you'd likely need off-chain services to render NFT metadata changes and visuals based on the on-chain data.
*   **Reward Mechanics:** The staking reward mechanism is a placeholder. You would need to design a specific reward system (e.g., platform tokens, access to exclusive content, etc.) and implement the logic in `claimStakingRewards`.
*   **More Complex Governance:** The governance system is very basic. For a more robust DAO-like governance, you would need to implement more sophisticated voting mechanisms (e.g., quadratic voting, delegated voting, time-locked voting), proposal types, and execution logic.
*   **Real-World Reputation:**  In a live platform, reputation would need to be earned through meaningful actions and interactions within the platform, not just by owner-controlled functions. You'd need to integrate reputation gain/loss with various platform functionalities.
*   **Error Handling and Events:** The contract includes basic error handling with `require` statements and emits events for important actions, which is good practice.

This example provides a solid foundation for a creative and advanced smart contract. You can expand upon these concepts to build a more feature-rich and sophisticated dynamic NFT platform.
