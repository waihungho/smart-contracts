 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC) - Smart Contract
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @dev A smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Art Collective (DAAC).
 * It enables artists to join, submit artwork NFTs, and participate in a community-governed art collective.
 * The collective features dynamic governance, curated art exhibitions, fractional ownership of collective pieces,
 * and innovative mechanisms for artist rewards and community engagement.
 *
 * **Outline:**
 *
 * **1. Collective Management:**
 *    - createCollective(): Allows contract deployer to initialize the collective.
 *    - joinCollective(): Artists can request to join the collective.
 *    - approveArtist(): Governors can approve artist applications.
 *    - leaveCollective(): Artists can leave the collective.
 *    - setGovernanceParameters(): Governors can propose and vote on governance parameters.
 *    - pauseCollective(): Governors can pause certain functions for emergency or maintenance.
 *    - unpauseCollective(): Governors can unpause paused functions.
 *
 * **2. Art NFT Management:**
 *    - registerArtist(): Artists register their profile with metadata.
 *    - mintArtNFT(): Registered artists can mint their artwork as NFTs within the collective.
 *    - setArtNFTPrice(): Artists can set the price for their individual NFTs.
 *    - purchaseArtNFT(): Users can purchase art NFTs.
 *    - transferArtNFT(): NFT holders can transfer their NFTs (with restrictions).
 *    - burnArtNFT(): Under specific conditions, NFTs can be burned by governors.
 *
 * **3. Curated Exhibitions & Collective Art:**
 *    - createExhibition(): Governors can create new art exhibitions with themes and durations.
 *    - submitArtToExhibition(): Artists can submit their NFTs to active exhibitions.
 *    - voteForExhibitionArt(): Collective members can vote on submitted art for exhibitions.
 *    - finalizeExhibition(): Governors finalize an exhibition, selecting exhibited art based on votes.
 *    - createCollectiveArtNFT(): Governors can create a "Collective Art NFT" from selected exhibition pieces.
 *    - fractionalizeCollectiveArtNFT(): Governors can fractionalize Collective Art NFTs into ERC1155 tokens.
 *
 * **4. Governance & Voting:**
 *    - proposeGovernanceChange(): Governors propose changes to governance parameters.
 *    - voteOnGovernanceProposal(): Collective members vote on governance proposals.
 *    - executeGovernanceProposal(): Governors execute approved governance proposals.
 *    - delegateVotingPower(): Members can delegate their voting power to others.
 *
 * **5. Utility & Information:**
 *    - getArtNFTMetadata(): Retrieve metadata for a specific Art NFT.
 *    - getCollectiveInfo(): Get general information about the collective.
 *    - getArtistProfile(): Retrieve profile information for an artist.
 *    - getExhibitionDetails(): Get details of a specific exhibition.
 *    - getVotingPower(): Get the voting power of a member.
 *
 * **Function Summary:**
 *
 * - `createCollective()`: Initializes the DAAC, setting up initial governors and parameters.
 * - `joinCollective()`: Allows artists to apply for membership in the DAAC.
 * - `approveArtist()`: Governors approve pending artist applications.
 * - `leaveCollective()`: Artists can voluntarily leave the DAAC.
 * - `setGovernanceParameters()`: Governors propose and vote on changes to DAAC governance rules.
 * - `pauseCollective()`: Governors can temporarily pause certain DAAC functions for maintenance or emergencies.
 * - `unpauseCollective()`: Governors can resume paused DAAC functions.
 * - `registerArtist()`: Artists register their profile and metadata within the DAAC.
 * - `mintArtNFT()`: Registered artists mint their artwork as NFTs within the DAAC ecosystem.
 * - `setArtNFTPrice()`: Artists set the price for their individually minted Art NFTs.
 * - `purchaseArtNFT()`: Users can purchase Art NFTs listed by artists.
 * - `transferArtNFT()`: Art NFT holders can transfer their NFTs, potentially with DAAC restrictions.
 * - `burnArtNFT()`: Governors can burn Art NFTs under specific, governed conditions.
 * - `createExhibition()`: Governors create themed art exhibitions with defined durations.
 * - `submitArtToExhibition()`: Artists submit their Art NFTs to participate in active exhibitions.
 * - `voteForExhibitionArt()`: Collective members vote to select art for exhibitions.
 * - `finalizeExhibition()`: Governors finalize exhibitions, selecting art based on community votes.
 * - `createCollectiveArtNFT()`: Governors create a special "Collective Art NFT" from selected exhibition pieces.
 * - `fractionalizeCollectiveArtNFT()`: Governors fractionalize Collective Art NFTs into ERC1155 tokens for shared ownership.
 * - `proposeGovernanceChange()`: Governors initiate proposals to change DAAC governance parameters.
 * - `voteOnGovernanceProposal()`: Collective members vote on active governance change proposals.
 * - `executeGovernanceProposal()`: Governors execute approved governance changes after successful voting.
 * - `delegateVotingPower()`: Members can delegate their voting rights to other members.
 * - `getArtNFTMetadata()`: Retrieves metadata associated with a specific Art NFT.
 * - `getCollectiveInfo()`: Returns general information and statistics about the DAAC.
 * - `getArtistProfile()`: Fetches profile information for a registered artist within the DAAC.
 * - `getExhibitionDetails()`: Provides detailed information about a specific art exhibition.
 * - `getVotingPower()`: Retrieves the current voting power of a DAAC member.
