Okay, let's create a smart contract with advanced, creative concepts revolving around time-locked, conditionally released, and delegatable asset vaults with dynamic state features. We'll call it `QuantumVault`.

This contract will allow users to deposit multiple types of ERC20 tokens into individual "vault entries". Each entry will have unique properties:
1.  **Time Lock:** Funds are locked until a specific timestamp.
2.  **Conditional Unlock:** Funds can *also* be unlocked if an off-chain condition is met and signaled via a trusted signature.
3.  **Timed Decay/Growth:** An optional feature where the effective withdrawable amount decreases (decay) or increases (growth - let's stick to decay for simplicity and uniqueness) over time if not withdrawn after a certain point.
4.  **Delegated Access:** The owner of a vault entry can delegate the right to withdraw to another address for a limited time.
5.  **State Commitment:** The contract owner can commit to a hash representing the state of certain vaults or external data, which can be used as a reference (e.g., for future conditional unlocks or audits).
6.  **Entry Management:** Users can transfer ownership of a vault entry or even split a single entry into multiple new ones.

It avoids simple multi-sig, standard vesting, or basic time-locks seen commonly in open source.

## Contract Outline and Function Summary

**Contract Name:** QuantumVault

**Concept:** A multi-asset vault (`ERC20`) where individual deposits (`VaultEntry`) have configurable unlock conditions (time, off-chain signal), optional time-based value decay, delegable withdrawal rights, and advanced entry management (transfer, split). Includes a mechanism for contract owner state commitments.

**Core Data Structures:**
*   `VaultEntry`: Stores details for a single user deposit (token, amount, deposit time, unlock time, condition hash, met flag, decay status, current owner, withdrawal delegate, delegation expiry, withdrawal status).
*   Mappings: `id -> VaultEntry`, `user -> list of entry ids`.

**Functions (20+):**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
2.  `deposit(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount)`: Users deposit ERC20 tokens, creating a new `VaultEntry` initially locked.
3.  `withdraw(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: Allows the owner of an entry (or a valid delegate) to withdraw the tokens if unlock conditions are met.
4.  `getUserVaultEntryIds(address user)`: View function - Retrieves all vault entry IDs associated with a user.
5.  `getVaultEntryDetails(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: View function - Retrieves detailed information about a specific vault entry.
6.  `isVaultEntryUnlocked(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: View function - Checks if the time lock has passed OR the condition has been met.
7.  `getCurrentWithdrawableAmount(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: View function - Calculates the amount available for withdrawal, considering potential decay.
8.  `setUnlockTime(uint256 vaultEntryId, uint256 unlockTimestamp)`: Allows the entry owner to set or update the time-based unlock timestamp.
9.  `setConditionalUnlock(uint256 vaultEntryId, bytes32 conditionHash)`: Allows the entry owner to define an off-chain condition represented by a hash.
10. `signalConditionMet(uint256 vaultEntryId, bytes32 conditionHash, bytes signature)`: Allows the contract owner (or a designated oracle address, simplified here to contract owner) to signal that a specific condition for an entry has been met, using a signature verified on-chain.
11. `startTimedDecay(uint256 vaultEntryId, uint256 decayRatePerSecond)`: Allows the entry owner to initiate a time-based decay on the entry's value.
12. `stopTimedDecay(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: Allows the entry owner to stop the decay process.
13. `delegateWithdrawalRight(uint256 vaultEntryId, address delegatee, uint256 permissionDuration)`: Allows the entry owner to grant withdrawal permissions to another address for a limited time.
14. `revokeWithdrawalRight(uint256 vaultEntryId, address delegatee)`: Allows the entry owner to revoke previously granted delegation.
15. `hasDelegatedWithdrawRight(uint256 vaultEntryId, address delegatee)`: View function - Checks if an address currently holds delegated withdrawal rights for an entry.
16. `transferVaultEntryOwnership(uint256 vaultEntryId, address newOwner)`: Allows the current entry owner to transfer ownership of the vault entry to another address.
17. `splitVaultEntry(uint256 vaultEntryId, uint256 amount1, address recipient1, uint256 amount2, address recipient2)`: Allows the current entry owner to split an unlocked vault entry into two new entries for specified recipients. Requires `amount1 + amount2 <= currentWithdrawableAmount`.
18. `lockVaultEntry(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: Allows the entry owner to re-lock an entry even if conditions are met (e.g., pause withdrawal).
19. `commitStateHash(bytes32 stateHash)`: Allows the contract owner to commit a specific state hash to the contract, acting as a reference point.
20. `checkStateHashCommitment()`: View function - Retrieves the last committed state hash by the contract owner.
21. `setOracleAddress(address _oracle)`: Allows the contract owner to set an address authorized to sign for `signalConditionMet`.
22. `getOracleAddress()`: View function - Get the current oracle address.
23. `extendLockTime(uint256 vaultEntryId, uint256 additionalTime)`: Allows the entry owner to add more time to the existing unlock timestamp.
24. `setEntryDescription(uint256 vaultEntryId, string calldata description)`: Allows the entry owner to set a small description string for the entry (e.g., purpose).
25. `getEntryDescription(uint256 vaultEntryId)`: View function - Gets the description.

**Explanation of Advanced/Creative Aspects:**

1.  **Hybrid Unlock Conditions (Time + Condition):** Combines standard time locks with external, verifiable conditions. This allows for unlocks based on real-world events, oracle data, or off-chain computation results, verified via signature (`signalConditionMet`).
2.  **On-Chain Signature Verification:** `signalConditionMet` uses `ECDSA.recover` to verify that the entity signaling the condition met is the designated `oracleAddress`, adding a layer of trust and off-chain interaction. The message hash structure ensures the signature is tied to the specific vault entry and condition.
3.  **Timed Decay Mechanism:** The `isDecaying`, `decayRatePerSecond`, `decayStartTime`, and `lastDecayUpdateTime` fields introduce a dynamic element to the vault's value. The `getCurrentWithdrawableAmount` function calculates this decay, making the effective value of the entry decrease over time if the owner enables it. This could model concepts like depreciation or expiring value. `_updateCurrentAmount` is a key internal helper to manage state changes correctly.
4.  **Delegated Withdrawal Rights:** The `_delegatedWithdrawalRights` mapping and associated functions allow an entry owner to grant temporary, time-limited permission to *someone else* to withdraw the funds. This is more granular than transferring full ownership and is useful for specific permissions or roles.
5.  **Entry Ownership Transfer:** Vault entries are not permanently tied to the depositor. The `currentOwner` field and `transferVaultEntryOwnership` function allow entries to be traded, gifted, or managed by a different key/contract.
6.  **Vault Entry Splitting:** The `splitVaultEntry` function is a novel concept. It allows an owner to divide the value of a single, unlocked vault entry into two *new*, independent vault entries, assignable to different recipients. This could be used for fractionalizing a locked asset position or distributing parts of a vault.
7.  **Explicit Locking/Unlocking:** The `isLocked` flag and `lockVaultEntry`/`releaseLock` functions give the entry owner manual control to override the automatic unlock conditions, providing flexibility to pause withdrawals even if time has passed or conditions are met.
8.  **State Commitment Hash:** The `lastCommittedStateHash` and `commitStateHash` function provide a simple, owner-controlled mechanism to stamp a verifiable hash onto the contract's history. While the contract itself doesn't *use* this hash for internal logic here, it serves as a committed reference point. This could be used off-chain to verify that a set of entries existed in a certain state at a certain block, or as a marker for future contract interactions/upgrades.
9.  **Dynamic Description:** Allows adding a small amount of dynamic, user-updatable metadata to each vault entry (`setEntryDescription`), which is less common in simple vault contracts.

This contract provides a rich set of interconnected features, going beyond simple deposits and withdrawals to offer dynamic state, conditional access, and flexible management of vaulted assets.
