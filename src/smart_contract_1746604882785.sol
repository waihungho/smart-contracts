Okay, let's design an advanced, creative, and non-standard smart contract.

**Concept:** A "Quantum Lock" - a sophisticated, state-driven, multi-condition, multi-party escrow-like contract capable of holding various assets (ETH and ERC20s). Its release mechanism is governed by a set of dynamically added conditions (time, external data, multi-party approval, even a probabilistic element via VRF) and progresses through distinct "quantum-inspired" states. It's designed for complex delayed releases, conditional transfers, or multi-stage agreements.

**Key Advanced Features:**

1.  **State Machine:** Uses an `enum` to manage distinct contract states (`Uninitialized`, `Active`, `Superpositioned`, `Collapsed`, `Released`, `Aborted`), enforcing specific actions only in certain states.
2.  **Multiple Condition Types:** Supports various unlocking criteria (`TimeBefore`, `TimeAfter`, `OracleValueGTE`, `OracleValueLTE`, `MultiPartyApproval`, `PaymentReceived`, `VRFSuccessful`).
3.  **Dynamic Configuration:** Conditions, beneficiaries, and approvers can be added *after* creation but before activation.
4.  **Multi-Asset Support:** Can hold ETH and multiple types of ERC20 tokens within a single lock instance.
5.  **Multi-Party Involvement:** Involves a creator, multiple beneficiaries, and potentially multiple required approvers.
6.  **Oracle Integration:** Designed to accept data from trusted oracle addresses.
7.  **Verifiable Random Function (VRF) Integration:** Can use VRF as a condition for "quantum collapse". (Note: Full VRF integration requires Chainlink setup and subscription, this contract provides the structure).
8.  **Role-Based Access:** Functions are restricted based on lock state and participant roles (creator, beneficiary, approver, oracle).
9.  **Complex Release Logic:** Assets are only releasable when the lock is in the `Collapsed` state, which is achieved only after all required conditions are met during the `Superpositioned` phase.
10. **Graceful Abort/Expiry:** Mechanisms for the creator to abort (in early states) or for the lock to become aborted upon expiry if conditions aren't met.

---

**Outline:**

1.  **Pragma & Imports:** Solidity version, IERC20 interface.
2.  **Owner Pattern:** Basic ownership for admin functions.
3.  **Enums:** `LockState`, `ConditionType`.
4.  **Structs:** `Condition`, `LockInstance`.
5.  **State Variables:** Mapping for locks, lock counter, owner, oracle addresses mapping, VRF variables.
6.  **Events:** For state changes, condition met, deposit, release, abort, etc.
7.  **Modifiers:** State checks, role checks.
8.  **Constructor:** Sets initial owner.
9.  **Lock Management Functions:**
    *   `createLockInstance`
    *   `addLockCondition`
    *   `addBeneficiary`
    *   `addApprover`
    *   `depositAsset` (ETH payable and ERC20 via transferFrom)
    *   `activateLock`
    *   `triggerSuperpositionCheck`
    *   `checkConditions` (Internal logic triggerable externally for gas)
    *   `collapseLock` (Internal state transition)
    *   `releaseAssets`
    *   `abortLock`
    *   `expireLockCheck` (External trigger for expiry)
10. **Condition Specific Functions:**
    *   `submitApproval`
    *   `receivePaymentConditionMet` (For ERC20 payment check)
    *   `fulfillRandomWords` (VRF callback)
    *   `updateOracleValue`
11. **View/Query Functions:**
    *   `getLockState`
    *   `getLockedAssets`
    *   `getLockConditions`
    *   `isBeneficiary`
    *   `isApprover`
    *   `getApprovalStatus`
    *   `getLockDetails`
    *   `getConditionStatus`
    *   `getLockCount`
12. **Admin Functions:**
    *   `transferOwnership`
    *   `renounceOwnership`
    *   `setOracleAddress`
    *   `setVRFCoordinator`
    *   `setKeyHash`
    *   `requestRandomWords` (To trigger VRF if needed by a condition)

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Deploys the contract and sets the initial owner.
2.  `createLockInstance(uint256 _expiryTime, string memory _metadataURI)`: Creates a new lock instance in the `Uninitialized` state with a creator, expiry time, and optional metadata.
3.  `addLockCondition(uint256 _lockId, ConditionType _type, uint256 _uintValue, address _addressValue, bytes32 _bytes32Value)`: Adds a condition to an `Uninitialized` or `Active` lock. Parameters used depend on `_type`.
4.  `addBeneficiary(uint256 _lockId, address _beneficiary)`: Adds an address that can claim assets upon successful lock release. Only callable in `Uninitialized` or `Active` states by the creator.
5.  `addApprover(uint256 _lockId, address _approver)`: Adds an address whose approval is required if a `MultiPartyApproval` condition exists. Callable in `Uninitialized` or `Active` states by the creator.
6.  `depositAsset(uint256 _lockId, address _assetAddress, uint256 _amount)`: Allows depositing ERC20 tokens (`_assetAddress` is token address) or ETH (`_assetAddress` is address(0)) into an `Uninitialized` or `Active` lock. Requires prior approval for ERC20s using `approve`.
7.  `activateLock(uint256 _lockId)`: Transitions the lock from `Uninitialized` to `Active`. Requires minimum conditions/assets/beneficiaries to be set. Sets the `activeTime`.
8.  `triggerSuperpositionCheck(uint256 _lockId)`: Initiates the condition evaluation phase. Transitions from `Active` to `Superpositioned`. Can only be called after `activeTime` and before `expiryTime`. Triggers internal condition checking.
9.  `checkConditions(uint256 _lockId)`: *Internal* function, called by `triggerSuperpositionCheck` and potentially others (like `submitApproval`, `updateOracleValue`, `fulfillRandomWords`) to re-evaluate all conditions. If all are met, transitions to `Collapsed`.
10. `collapseLock(uint256 _lockId)`: *Internal* function called by `checkConditions` when all conditions are met. Transitions from `Superpositioned` to `Collapsed`, making assets available for release.
11. `releaseAssets(uint256 _lockId)`: Allows a registered beneficiary to claim all assets from a lock that is in the `Collapsed` state.
12. `abortLock(uint256 _lockId)`: Allows the creator to abort the lock and reclaim assets. Only possible in `Uninitialized`, `Active` (before `Superpositioned` is triggered and before expiry), or `Aborted` (allowing creator to pull if not already taken by expiry logic) states.
13. `expireLockCheck(uint256 _lockId)`: Allows anyone to trigger a check if the lock has passed its `expiryTime` while not in a terminal state (`Released`, `Collapsed`, `Aborted`). If expired, transitions to `Aborted`.
14. `submitApproval(uint256 _lockId)`: Allows a designated approver to submit their approval for a lock with a `MultiPartyApproval` condition. Updates the approval status and potentially triggers condition re-check.
15. `receivePaymentConditionMet(uint256 _lockId, uint256 _expectedAmount)`: A function the designated payer calls *after* ensuring the required ERC20 payment (_expectedAmount_) has been transferred to the contract for this lock. Marks the `PaymentReceived` condition as met. Requires prior ERC20 allowance.
16. `fulfillRandomWords(uint256 _requestId, uint256[] memory _randomWords)`: VRF callback function (Chainlink VRF v2). Used to receive randomness and mark the `VRFSuccessful` condition as met if the request ID matches.
17. `updateOracleValue(bytes32 _oracleKey, uint256 _value)`: Allows a designated oracle address to update a specific data feed value stored in the contract. Triggers re-check for relevant `OracleValueGTE`/`LTE` conditions.
18. `getLockState(uint256 _lockId)`: View function returning the current state of a lock.
19. `getLockedAssets(uint256 _lockId)`: View function returning the mapping of asset addresses to amounts held in a lock.
20. `getLockConditions(uint256 _lockId)`: View function returning the list of conditions associated with a lock.
21. `isBeneficiary(uint256 _lockId, address _account)`: View function checking if an address is a beneficiary of a lock.
22. `isApprover(uint256 _lockId, address _account)`: View function checking if an address is a required approver for a lock's `MultiPartyApproval` condition.
23. `getApprovalStatus(uint256 _lockId, address _approver)`: View function returning the approval status of a specific approver for a lock.
24. `getLockDetails(uint256 _lockId)`: View function returning summary details of a lock (creator, times, metadata).
25. `getConditionStatus(uint256 _lockId, uint256 _conditionIndex)`: View function returning the status (met/not met) of a specific condition for a lock.
26. `getLockCount()`: View function returning the total number of locks created.
27. `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfers contract ownership (admin).
28. `renounceOwnership()`: Renounces contract ownership.
29. `setOracleAddress(bytes32 _oracleKey, address _oracleAddress)`: Sets the trusted address for a specific oracle data key. Only callable by the owner.
30. `setVRFCoordinator(address _coordinator)`: Sets the VRF coordinator address. Only callable by the owner.
31. `setKeyHash(bytes32 _keyHash)`: Sets the VRF key hash. Only callable by the owner.
32. `requestRandomWords(uint256 _lockId, uint32 _numWords, uint16 _requestConfirmations, uint32 _callbackGasLimit)`: Initiates a VRF request for a specific lock, potentially required by a `VRFSuccessful` condition. Only callable by the contract creator in `Superpositioned` state.

*(Note: Functions 30-32 are related to Chainlink VRF v2 integration setup. Full VRF functionality requires additional setup like a Chainlink Subscription ID and funding. This contract provides the necessary function stubs and logic flow).*
