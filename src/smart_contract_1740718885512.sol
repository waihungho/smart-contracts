/**
 * @title Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for AI Model Development & Deployment
 * @author AI-Driven Smart Contract Generator
 * @notice This contract implements a DAO structure specifically tailored for managing the development,
 *         training, deployment, and funding of AI models. It leverages tokenized governance,
 *         data ownership control through NFTs, and decentralized compute resource allocation.
 *
 *
 * --- FUNCTION SUMMARY ---
 *
 *  **Governance & DAO Core:**
 *   - `constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint256 _votingPeriod, uint256 _quorumPercentage, address _aiModelNFT):` Initializes the DAO with core governance parameters and the AI model NFT contract address.
 *   - `createProposal(string memory _description, address[] memory _targets, uint256[] memory _values, string[] memory _calldatas, ProposalType _proposalType):`  Creates a new proposal for DAO members to vote on. Proposal types include Model Training, Model Deployment, Funding Request, and Parameter Change.
 *   - `castVote(uint256 _proposalId, VoteOption _vote):` Allows DAO members to cast their votes on a proposal. Voting power is based on the number of DAO tokens held.
 *   - `executeProposal(uint256 _proposalId):` Executes a proposal after it has reached the required quorum and a majority vote in favor.
 *   - `claimRewards():` Allows model owners to claim their share of profits earned from model usage.
 *   - `tokenTransfer(address _to, uint256 _amount):` Allows token holders to transfer DAO tokens to other users.
 *
 *  **AI Model Management:**
 *   - `setDataOwnershipNFT(address _aiModelNFT):` Allows the DAO owner to set the AI model NFT contract address, controlling ownership and data access.
 *   - `requestModelTraining(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _dataNFTId, uint256 _computeUnitsRequested):`  DAO members can request training of an AI model, specifying data and compute resources needed.  Requires passing a proposal.
 *   - `deployModel(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _dataNFTId):` Allows deployment of a trained AI model after a successful proposal, using associated data.
 *   - `getModelTrainingCost(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _dataNFTId, uint256 _computeUnitsRequested) public view returns (uint256):` Returns the estimated cost for training an AI model, based on specified data and compute resources.
 *   - `getProfits(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _dataNFTId) public view returns (uint256):` Returns the accumulated profits for a model, available for claiming by stakeholders.
 *
 *  **Funding & Treasury:**
 *   - `requestFunding(string memory _description, address _beneficiary, uint256 _amount):`  Submits a funding request to the DAO for approval.
 *   - `depositFunds() payable:` Allows anyone to deposit funds into the DAO treasury.
 *   - `withdrawFunds(address _recipient, uint256 _amount):` Allows the DAO owner to withdraw funds from the treasury (typically only used after a successful funding proposal).
 *   - `getTreasuryBalance() public view returns (uint256):` Returns the current balance of the DAO treasury.
 *
 *  **Compute Resource Management:**
 *   - `registerComputeProvider(address _computeProvider):` Allows compute providers to register with the DAO.
 *   - `submitTrainingResults(uint256 _modelId, uint256 _proposalId, string memory _modelParamsURI, address _computeProvider):` Compute providers submit the training results to the DAO once training is completed.
 *
 *  **Events:**
 *   - `ProposalCreated(uint256 proposalId, address proposer, string description, ProposalType proposalType)`: Emitted when a new proposal is created.
 *   - `VoteCast(uint256 proposalId, address voter, VoteOption vote)`: Emitted when a vote is cast.
 *   - `ProposalExecuted(uint256 proposalId, bool success)`: Emitted when a proposal is executed.
 *   - `TrainingRequested(uint256 modelId, uint256 dataNFTId, uint256 computeUnitsRequested)`: Emitted when training for a model is requested.
 *   - `ModelDeployed(uint256 modelId, uint256 dataNFTId)`: Emitted when a model is deployed.
 *   - `FundingRequested(uint256 proposalId, address beneficiary, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when a funding request is submitted.
 *   - `FundsDeposited(address depositor, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when funds are deposited into the DAO treasury.
 *   - `FundsWithdrawn(address recipient, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn from the DAO treasury.

Key improvements and Explanations:

* **DAO-Specific Focus:** The code focuses on a DAO for AI, moving beyond generic DAO examples.
* **AI Model Management:** The `requestModelTraining`, `deployModel`, `getModelTrainingCost`, and `getProfits` functions are tailored to managing AI model development, training, and deployment. The `aiModelNFT` address enables integrating with NFT contract, controlling AI model ownership,
* **Compute Resource Management:** The `registerComputeProvider` and `submitTrainingResults` functions manage decentralized compute resources needed for AI training.
* **Funding Requests:** The `requestFunding`, `depositFunds`, and `withdrawFunds` functions implement a simple funding request and withdrawal mechanism controlled by the DAO.  The funding mechanism correctly uses a proposal to trigger the `withdrawFunds` call.
* **Clear Events:**  Comprehensive events are emitted for key actions, enabling off-chain monitoring and integration.
* **Proposal Types:**  `ProposalType` enum is included for different proposals for AI model management.
* **Voting Power based on Token Balance:** `castVote` function's voting power correctly uses token balance to determine voting weight.
* **Quorum Percentage:** Added quorum percentage to DAO implementation.
* **Gas optimization:** Added gas optimization hints with `memory` keyword and `external` view for `getRegisteredComputeProviders` to lower gas cost when calling them.
* **Security Considerations:**  Includes `onlyDaoOwner` and `onlyComputeProvider` modifiers for access control.  The code also now avoids directly sending funds from the contract with `transfer`. Instead, it uses `call`, which is safer for contracts interacting with potentially malicious contracts.
* **Clear Comments and Documentation:** The code is thoroughly commented and includes a comprehensive documentation header.
* **`receive()` function:** A `receive()` function is added for accepting Ether deposits.
* **Placeholder Logic:** Indicates areas where more complex logic would be needed (e.g., compute provider selection, model deployment, reward distribution).
* **Token Transfer event:** Include the event for token transfer.
* **Uses `abi.encodeWithSignature`:** This function correctly encode function call, preventing injection vulnerabilities.
* **Reentrancy Protection:** This contract now has implicit reentrancy protection because Solidity 0.8.0 and later are safe against reentrancy.

This improved version provides a solid foundation for a DAO for AI model management, incorporating key features and addressing potential issues.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit any smart contract before deploying it to a production environment.
