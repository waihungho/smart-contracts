Okay, let's design a smart contract called `QuantumFluxGovernor`.

This contract will be a highly advanced, non-standard governance system. It incorporates concepts beyond typical OpenZeppelin Governor implementations, such as:

1.  **Dynamic Voting Power (Quantum Flux Score):** Voting power isn't just based on token balance, but also on a "Quantum Flux Score" that accumulates through active participation (proposing, voting) and decays over inactivity. This encourages consistent engagement.
2.  **Time-Weighted Flux Decay:** The Flux Score decays over time, calculated dynamically when needed, not requiring gas-heavy periodic updates.
3.  **Adaptive Quorum/Thresholds (Conceptual/Future-Proofing):** The design could potentially support parameters that adjust based on past governance outcomes or average Flux Score (though direct implementation of *complex* adaptive logic in Solidity can be gas-prohibitive without oracles; we'll focus on having the *ability* to update these parameters via governance).
4.  **Proposal Queuing with Variable Timelock:** Successful proposals enter a queue, but the timelock duration could conceptually vary based on proposal complexity or risk (we'll implement a fixed timelock but design for future variability).
5.  **Batch Execution:** A single `execute` call can trigger multiple actions defined in a proposal.
6.  **Delegation with Flux:** Delegation transfers both voting power *and* potentially contributes to the delegatee's Flux Score (design decision: let's have Flux accrue to the *voter/proposer*, not delegatee, keeping Flux tied to direct *interaction*). Delegation will transfer the calculated `getDynamicVotingPower`.
7.  **Emergency Council & Shutdown:** A specific group can pause critical governance functions in case of a major exploit or issue.

Let's aim for 20+ *external/public* functions, including getters and actions.

### QuantumFluxGovernor Smart Contract

**Outline:**

1.  **License & Imports:** SPDX License, Solidity version, necessary imports (Address, ERC20 interface).
2.  **Interfaces:** Define interfaces for the governance token (ERC20-like with delegation history) and potentially a managed Treasury contract.
3.  **Errors:** Custom errors for clarity and gas efficiency.
4.  **Events:** Significant state changes emit events.
5.  **State Variables:**
    *   References to governance token and treasury.
    *   Governance parameters (voting period, proposal threshold, quorum percentage, timelock duration, flux decay rate).
    *   Proposal storage: Mapping from proposal ID to details (actions, proposer, state, votes, timing).
    *   User state: Mapping addresses to Flux Score data (`lastInteractionTimestamp`, `fluxScore`).
    *   Voting state: Mapping proposal ID and voter address to their vote.
    *   Delegation state (using token's checkpointing).
    *   Counters, Emergency state variables.
6.  **Modifiers:** Access control and state checks.
7.  **Constructor:** Initializes contract with token, treasury addresses, and initial parameters.
8.  **Core Governance Flow Functions:**
    *   `propose`: Create a new proposal.
    *   `state`: Get the current state of a proposal.
    *   `vote`: Cast a vote on an active proposal.
    *   `queue`: Move a successful proposal to the queued state.
    *   `execute`: Enact a queued proposal's actions.
    *   `cancel`: Cancel a proposal (if conditions met).
9.  **Delegation Functions:**
    *   `delegate`: Delegate voting power and potentially contribute to Flux score indirectly.
    *   `delegateBySig`: Delegate using EIP-712 signature.
    *   `renounceDelegation`: Revoke current delegation.
10. **Quantum Flux System Functions:**
    *   `getFluxScore`: Get the dynamically calculated current flux score for an address.
    *   `getDynamicVotingPower`: Get the combined voting power (tokens + flux) for an address at a specific block (or current).
    *   `(Internal) _updateFluxScore`: Helper to increase flux score and update timestamp on interaction.
    *   `(Internal) _getRawFluxScore`: Helper to get the stored raw score and timestamp.
11. **Parameter Update Functions (Governable):**
    *   `updateVotingPeriod`: Change the duration proposals are open.
    *   `updateProposalThreshold`: Change the minimum tokens needed to propose.
    *   `updateQuorumPercentage`: Change the percentage of total supply needed to reach quorum.
    *   `updateTimelockDuration`: Change the queue period.
    *   `updateFluxDecayRate`: Change how quickly flux score decays.
    *   `updateTreasuryAddress`: Change the governed treasury contract.
12. **Emergency Functions:**
    *   `setEmergencyCouncil`: Set the addresses allowed to trigger emergency shutdown.
    *   `emergencyShutdown`: Pause core governance actions.
    *   `resumeOperation`: Resume operations (requires governance proposal after shutdown).
13. **Helper & Getter Functions (Public/External):**
    *   `getProposalDetails`: Retrieve comprehensive details about a proposal.
    *   `getProposalsCount`: Get the total number of proposals created.
    *   `hasVoted`: Check if an address has voted on a specific proposal.
    *   `getProposalVoteCounts`: Get FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAIN vote counts for a proposal.
    *   `getTokenAddress`: Get the governance token address.
    *   `getTreasuryAddress`: Get the treasury address.
    *   `getCurrentVotingPower`: Get the dynamic voting power at the current block.
    *   `getProposalState`: Alias for `state()`.

**Explanation of Key Concepts & Advanced Features:**

1.  **Quantum Flux Score (`s_fluxData`, `getFluxScore`, `_updateFluxScore`, `getDynamicVotingPower`):**
    *   Instead of a static balance snapshot, voting power has a dynamic component.
    *   `s_fluxData` stores a raw score and the last interaction timestamp for each user.
    *   `getFluxScore` calculates the *current* effective score by applying a linear decay based on the time elapsed since the last interaction (`s_fluxDecayRate`). This is gas-efficient as decay is calculated on-the-fly.
    *   `_updateFluxScore` is called internally by `propose`, `vote`, and `delegate`. It calculates the current decayed score, adds new points (incentivizing interaction), and updates the `lastInteractionTimestamp` to "refresh" the decay timer.
    *   `getDynamicVotingPower` combines the traditional token-based voting power (using `getPastVotes` at a specific block for snapshot consistency) with the *current* flux score (`getFluxScore`). This means Flux power is always up-to-date, encouraging users to keep their Flux score high, while token power is fixed at the proposal's snapshot block.
    *   The weighting (1 token vote = 1 flux point) is a simplification; this could be a configurable parameter or use a more complex formula.

2.  **Time-Weighted Decay (`s_fluxDecayRate`, `getFluxScore`):** The decay is implemented directly in the `getFluxScore` calculation. This avoids needing a separate, gas-intensive function to periodically update scores for all users.

3.  **Proposal Lifecycle:** Follows a standard pattern (Pending -> Active -> Succeeded/Defeated -> Queued/Expired -> Executed/Canceled) but is implemented manually within the `state` function based on block numbers and timestamps, giving fine-grained control.

4.  **Delegation Integration:** The `delegate` and `delegateBySig` functions interact with an `IERC20Votes` token, which handles the token-specific delegation checkpoints. Importantly, these actions also call `_updateFluxScore` for the user initiating the delegation, contributing a small amount to their Flux score for engaging with the system. `getDynamicVotingPower` uses the token's `getPastVotes` for the token part, ensuring token power is snapshotted correctly.

5.  **Governable Parameters:** Key parameters (`s_votingPeriod`, `s_quorumPercentage`, etc.) can only be changed via a governance proposal successfully executed, calling the respective `update...` functions. This makes the system itself governable.

6.  **Emergency Shutdown:** The `EmergencyCouncil` (settable via governance) can trigger `emergencyShutdown`, which uses a simple boolean flag (`s_emergencyShutdownActive`) to block core actions (`propose`, `vote`, `queue`, `execute`, `cancel`). `resumeOperation` can only be called via a governance proposal that is successfully executed *while* the system is in shutdown, providing a mechanism for recovery decided by the community.

7.  **Error Handling:** Uses custom errors (`error ...`) which are more gas-efficient than `require` with strings in Solidity 0.8+.

8.  **Structs and Mappings:** Organized state variables using structs (`Proposal`, `FluxData`) and mappings for efficient lookup of proposal and user data.

**Limitations and Potential Improvements (Beyond Scope of 20+ Functions Example):**

*   **Gas Efficiency:** While some aspects are gas-efficient (like flux decay calculation), iterating through a large `s_currentEmergencyCouncil` array in `setEmergencyCouncil` is not. Better patterns exist for managing lists or access control. Storing all proposal parameters on-chain can also become expensive over time.
*   **Complexity of Flux Weighting:** The 1:1 weighting of token votes and flux is simple. A real system might need research into ideal weighting or multipliers, possibly tied to total supply or other metrics.
*   **Quorum Calculation:** Quorum calculation relies on `governanceToken.getPastTotalSupply()`. The token contract must support this or a similar function to get the total voting power available at the snapshot block.
*   **Upgradeability:** This contract is not upgradeable. A production system would likely use a proxy pattern (like UUPS or Transparent) to allow logic updates via governance.
*   **Formal Verification:** For a real governance system, formal verification would be highly recommended to mathematically prove safety properties.
*   **Off-chain Data:** The proposal `description` is not stored on-chain (only its hash). Off-chain services are needed to store and serve the actual proposal text/markdown.

This `QuantumFluxGovernor` provides a foundation for a more dynamic and engaging governance system, stepping beyond standard implementations with its unique flux score mechanism.
