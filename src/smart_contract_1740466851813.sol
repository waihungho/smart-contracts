// Social Impact Bond (SIB) Smart Contract
//
// This smart contract implements a decentralized Social Impact Bond (SIB) platform.
//  SIBs are a results-based financing model where investors provide upfront capital
//  to service providers, and governments (or other outcome funders) repay the investors
//  only if pre-defined social outcomes are achieved.
//
// Key Features:
//  - Outcome Definition: Defines the target social outcome, measurement metrics,
//    and success thresholds.
//  - Investor Funding: Allows investors to contribute funds to support the social program.
//  - Service Provider Execution:  Service providers deliver the intervention
//    according to the agreed-upon plan.
//  - Outcome Measurement: An oracle reports the measured social outcome on-chain.
//  - Outcome Verification: An independent validator verifies the oracle's report
//    against pre-defined criteria.
//  - Investor Repayment:  If outcomes are achieved, the outcome funder pays back
//    the investors with a pre-agreed return.
//  - Dispute Resolution:  Incorporates a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism
//    in case of disagreement regarding outcome measurement or verification.
//  - Tokenization of Impact:  Represents the "impact" achieved as fungible tokens.
//
// Function Summary:
//  - init: Initializes the SIB contract with outcome definition, roles, and parameters.
//  - fund: Allows investors to contribute funds.
//  - report_outcome:  Allows the designated oracle to report the measured outcome.
//  - verify_outcome: Allows the validator to verify the oracle's report.
//  - trigger_repayment: Triggers the repayment to investors if the outcome is verified.
//  - create_dispute: Allows parties to initiate a dispute regarding outcome reporting.
//  - resolve_dispute: Allows an arbitrator to resolve a dispute.
//  - mint_impact_tokens: Mints impact tokens proportional to the achieved outcomes.
//
// This is a complex example and requires dependencies and setup.  See the comments for areas
//  that require specific implementation details.  This also assumes a relatively sophisticated
//  development environment with appropriate oracle and dispute resolution integrations.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Detailed Docstrings and Function Summary:**  Provides a clear overview of the contract's purpose, functionality, and individual function descriptions.  This is crucial for understanding complex contracts.
* **Social Impact Bond (SIB) Concept:** Implements a creative and trending use case. SIBs align investment with positive social outcomes, making them a relevant application of blockchain technology.
* **Role-Based Access Control:**  Uses an `enum` `Role` and a `StorageHashMap` to manage permissions for different actors (investors, service providers, oracles, validators).  The `ensure_role` helper function enforces these permissions, significantly improving security.
* **State Management:** The `SibStatus` enum manages the contract's lifecycle, ensuring that functions are executed in the correct order. This prevents errors and ensures the contract operates as intended.  Status transitions happen within the functions (e.g., `report_outcome` moves the status to `OutcomeVerification`).
* **Event Emission:**  Emits events for important state changes (funding, outcome reporting, verification, repayment, disputes).  This allows external systems to monitor the contract's progress.
* **Dispute Resolution Mechanism:** Includes `create_dispute` and `resolve_dispute` functions for handling disagreements.  This is essential for real-world SIB implementations.  The `Arbitrator` role is key here.
* **Impact Tokenization:** Includes a placeholder `mint_impact_tokens` function.  This represents a trendy concept: tokenizing the social impact achieved by the SIB.  **Important:**  This requires integration with a token standard like PSP22, which is *not* included in this example but is crucial for a functional implementation.  The comments highlight this dependency.
* **Repayment Logic:** Calculates repayment based on a `repayment_rate` of the outcome that was achieved.
* **Error Handling:** Includes basic `assert!` statements for input validation and status checks.  **Crucially,** includes a basic `transfer` error handling example.  More robust error handling should be implemented.
* **Modular Design:**  The code is structured with enums, structs, and functions to improve readability and maintainability.
* **Clear Comments:** The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section and highlighting areas that require further development.  The comments are strategically placed to guide the developer.
* **Unit Tests:**  Includes a basic set of unit tests to demonstrate contract functionality.  More tests are needed to thoroughly cover all scenarios.
* **`extract_outcome_value` Placeholder:** Provides a placeholder for extracting the quantitative outcome value from the `outcome_reported` string.  This highlights the need for custom parsing logic based on the specific outcome metrics defined for the SIB. *This is a critical section to customize for a real contract.*
* **Uses `ink_prelude`:**  Uses `ink_prelude` for data structures like `String` and `Vec`, making the contract compatible with `no_std` environments.
* **Division by 10000 in `trigger_repayment`:** This addresses the repayment rate is a percentage out of 100 (e.g 50.00%), so to make it out of 10000 we need to divide it.
* **Role Assignment on Construction:** The `new` constructor now assigns roles to the provided accounts.  The contract deployer is also automatically assigned the `Investor` role.

**To make this a *fully* functional SIB contract, you would need to:**

1. **Implement PSP22 Token Integration:**  Integrate with a PSP22 token contract (or similar) for minting impact tokens.  You'll need to deploy a separate PSP22 token contract and call its `mint` function from the `mint_impact_tokens` function.
2. **Implement More Robust Error Handling:**  Improve error handling throughout the contract, especially in the `transfer` function.  Consider using `Result` types to propagate errors.
3. **Implement Outcome Report Parsing:**  Implement the `extract_outcome_value` function to parse the `outcome_reported` string according to the defined `outcome_metrics`.  This will require custom logic based on the format of the outcome reports.
4. **Implement Real Oracle Integration:** In a real-world scenario, the oracle would likely be an external service that pushes data to the contract.  This would require integrating with an off-chain data feed.
5. **Add More Tests:** Write more comprehensive unit tests to cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
6. **Consider Timeouts:**  Add timeouts for the `OutcomeVerification` phase. If the validator doesn't verify within a certain timeframe, the contract could automatically proceed to a default resolution.
7. **Add a Refund Mechanism:** If the funding goal isn't met within a specific period, allow investors to withdraw their funds.
8. **Access Control Modifiers:** Create modifier functions to check roles and status, so code duplication is minimized.

This expanded explanation and improved code provide a much more complete and sophisticated example of a smart contract with advanced concepts.  Remember that this is a complex topic, and a real-world SIB implementation would require careful design, testing, and auditing.
