Okay, here is a Solidity smart contract implementing a "ChronoGuard Vault". This concept combines time-based locking, conditional release, granular time-limited function-signature-based delegation, and a timed emergency pause mechanism.

It aims to be interesting and go beyond a simple deposit/withdrawal contract by introducing:

1.  **Time-Locked Vaults:** Users can deposit funds and lock them until a specific future time.
2.  **Conditional Release:** Funds from a lock can only be withdrawn after the unlock time has passed and by referencing the specific lock ID.
3.  **Granular Delegated Access:** The owner can grant specific addresses permission to call *certain functions* (identified by their signature) with *time limits* and *amount limits*.
4.  **Timed Parameter Changes:** Sensitive configuration changes (like withdrawal fees) require a delay before they take effect, allowing time for review or emergency action.
5.  **Timed Emergency Pause:** A multi-step process for pausing the contract in emergencies, requiring the owner to initiate and then *execute* the pause after a delay.

This combines concepts of timed execution, access control lists (`bytes4` signatures as identifiers), and multi-stage operations.

**ChronoGuard Vault Contract**

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables:** Stores contract owner, balances (ETH and ERC20), lock data, delegated permissions, configuration parameters (fees, fee recipient), pause state, pending parameter changes, and version.
2.  **Data Structures:** Defines structs for `Lock`, `DelegatedPermission`, and `PendingParameterChange`.
3.  **Events:** Logs key actions like deposits, withdrawals, lock creation, permission grants, parameter changes, and pausing/resuming.
4.  **Modifiers:** Common checks like `onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, and custom `onlyDelegate` for checking delegated permissions.
5.  **Constructor:** Initializes the contract owner.
6.  **Core Vault Functionality:** Deposit and withdraw ETH/ERC20 tokens.
7.  **Time-Locking:** Functions to create and release time-locked deposits.
8.  **Delegated Access Management:** Functions to grant, revoke, and check delegated permissions based on function signatures, time, and amount limits.
9.  **Configuration:** Functions to set vault parameters, implementing a timed delay mechanism for sensitive changes.
10. **Emergency Controls:** Functions for initiating and executing a timed emergency pause, and resuming.
11. **Query Functions:** View functions to retrieve contract state, balances, lock information, and permission details.
12. **Utility:** Internal functions and versioning.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor()`: Initializes the contract owner.
2.  `depositETH()`: Receives Ether into the vault.
3.  `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Deposits a specified amount of an ERC20 token.
4.  `withdrawETH(uint256 amount)`: Withdraws Ether from the vault (owner/authorized delegate). Applies fee.
5.  `withdrawERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Withdraws a specified amount of an ERC20 token (owner/authorized delegate). Applies fee.
6.  `createLock(address tokenOrETH, uint256 amount, uint48 unlockTime)`: Creates a time-locked entry for a user's funds (ETH or ERC20) until `unlockTime`.
7.  `releaseLock(address tokenOrETH, uint256 lockId)`: Releases funds from a specific lock entry *if* `unlockTime` has passed.
8.  `grantDelegatedPermission(address delegate, bytes4 functionSignature, uint64 expirationTime, uint256 maxAmount)`: Grants `delegate` permission to call a function identified by `functionSignature` until `expirationTime`, with a `maxAmount` limit for operations involving value.
9.  `revokeDelegatedPermission(address delegate, bytes4 functionSignature)`: Revokes a specific delegated permission.
10. `initiateParameterChange(bytes4 parameterIdentifier, uint256 newValue, uint48 delayUntil)`: Starts a process to change a contract parameter, setting a new value that will only be effective after `delayUntil`.
11. `executeParameterChange(bytes4 parameterIdentifier)`: Executes a pending parameter change *if* the `delayUntil` time has passed.
12. `initiateEmergencyPause(uint48 delayUntil)`: Starts the timed emergency pause sequence, making the vault pausable after `delayUntil`.
13. `executeEmergencyPause()`: Executes the emergency pause *if* the initiation delay has passed.
14. `resumeVault()`: Resumes the vault from a paused state (owner only).
15. `setWithdrawalFee(uint256 feeBasisPoints)`: Internal helper/initial setter for withdrawal fee (used via timed parameter change).
16. `setLockingBonusFeeReduction(uint256 reductionBasisPoints)`: Internal helper/initial setter for fee reduction on locked funds (used via timed parameter change).
17. `setFeeRecipient(address recipient)`: Internal helper/initial setter for the fee recipient address (used via timed parameter change).
18. `getETHBalance()`: Returns the contract's current Ether balance.
19. `getERC20Balance(address token)`: Returns the contract's balance of a specific ERC20 token.
20. `getUserTotalBalance(address user, address tokenOrETH)`: Returns a user's total balance (available + locked) for a specific token/ETH.
21. `getUserAvailableBalance(address user, address tokenOrETH)`: Returns a user's available (unlocked) balance for a specific token/ETH.
22. `getUserLockedAmount(address user, address tokenOrETH)`: Returns the total amount locked by a user for a specific token/ETH.
23. `getUserLocks(address user, address tokenOrETH)`: Returns details of all lock entries for a user and token/ETH. (Note: Can be gas intensive for many locks).
24. `getDelegatedPermission(address delegate, bytes4 functionSignature)`: Returns the details of a specific delegated permission.
25. `getPendingParameterChange(bytes4 parameterIdentifier)`: Returns details of a pending parameter change.
26. `getWithdrawalFee()`: Returns the current withdrawal fee basis points.
27. `getLockingBonusFeeReduction()`: Returns the current fee reduction basis points for locked funds.
28. `getFeeRecipient()`: Returns the address currently set to receive fees.
29. `isPaused()`: Returns the current pause state.
30. `getVersion()`: Returns the contract version.

**Explanation of Advanced Concepts and Features:**

1.  **Time-Based Logic (`uint48` Timestamps):** Uses `uint48` for timestamps (`unlockTime`, `expirationTime`, `delayUntil`, `pauseInitiationTime`, `pauseExecutionTime`) instead of `uint256` to save gas, as block timestamps are typically much smaller. Requires careful casting. `block.timestamp` is used extensively for time comparisons.
2.  **Conditional Release (`releaseLock`):** Funds are not automatically released. A user must call `releaseLock` *after* the `unlockTime` has passed. This keeps control with the user while enforcing the minimum lock duration.
3.  **`withdrawReleasedFunds` with Fee Reduction:** A separate withdrawal function (`withdrawReleasedFunds`) is introduced specifically for users who have *just* released funds from a lock. It applies a *reduced* fee (`lockingBonusFeeReductionBasisPoints`) compared to a standard `withdraw` from available balance. This incentivizes users to utilize the locking feature. Note the simple `msg.sender == tx.origin` check to prevent this reduced-fee withdrawal from being used via delegation or other contracts, keeping it specifically for the original locker.
4.  **Function-Signature-Based Delegation (`bytes4`, `onlyDelegate` modifier):** The `grantDelegatedPermission` and `onlyDelegate` modifier use `bytes4` function selectors (`msg.sig` and `this.functionName.selector`) to specify *exactly* which functions a delegate is authorized to call. This provides fine-grained access control not commonly found in basic role-based systems.
5.  **Time and Amount Limited Delegation:** Delegated permissions are time-bound (`expirationTime`) and can have a maximum cumulative amount (`maxAmount`) that the delegate can transact using that specific permission signature. The `onlyDelegate` modifier checks the time, and the called function (e.g., `withdrawETH`, `withdrawERC20`) updates the `amountUsed` and checks against `maxAmount`.
6.  **Timed Parameter Changes:** Sensitive configuration changes (`initiateParameterChange`, `executeParameterChange`) are not instant. The owner must *initiate* the change with a future `delayUntil` time, and then *execute* it after that time has passed. This provides a built-in safeguard against hasty changes and allows time for monitoring or potential emergency response (like pausing the contract if a malicious change is attempted). Parameters are identified by `bytes4` unique identifiers. Casting between `address` and `uint256` is needed when storing addresses as `newValue`.
7.  **Timed Emergency Pause:** Similar to parameter changes, the emergency pause (`initiateEmergencyPause`, `executeEmergencyPause`) requires two steps and a time delay. The owner initiates it, setting a future time when the pause *can* be executed. This prevents an instantaneous pause which could potentially trap funds unexpectedly, while still providing a mechanism to halt operations after a short warning period.
8.  **ETH vs ERC20 Handling (`ETH_ADDRESS` Constant):** Uses `address(0)` as a convention to represent native Ether throughout the mappings and function parameters, simplifying the logic for handling both asset types in shared data structures and functions.
9.  **Simple Versioning:** Includes a `contractVersion` state variable, a common practice for tracking contract upgrades or revisions off-chain.

This contract aims to be a more complex and feature-rich example than a standard vault, demonstrating several interconnected advanced concepts within a single system. Remember that deploying and managing such a contract requires thorough testing and understanding of gas costs, especially for view functions returning arrays. For production use, further optimizations (e.g., iterating through maps, returning large arrays) and a more robust upgrade mechanism might be necessary.
