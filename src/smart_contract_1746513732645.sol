Okay, let's design a smart contract that implements a complex, multi-phase auction with "entanglement" rules inspired loosely by quantum mechanics (using the metaphor of states collapsing and interactions influencing outcomes). This avoids simple auction types and introduces novel logic.

We'll call it `QuantumAuctionHouse`.

**Core Concept:** A multi-item auction where bids are initially committed secretly (like a superposition), then revealed (state collapse). Crucially, certain items can be "entangled," meaning a bidder cannot win *all* items within an entangled group; winning one affects their eligibility for others in that group. The auction resolves winning bids and distributes items/funds based on these complex rules.

**Advanced/Creative Aspects:**
1.  **Commitment-Reveal Mechanism:** Adds privacy and prevents bid sniping during the commitment phase.
2.  **Entanglement Rules:** Introduces dependency between items and bids, making the auction outcome non-trivial and requiring a complex resolution phase.
3.  **Multi-Phase State Machine:** Explicitly defined phases with time limits and controlled transitions.
4.  **On-Chain Resolution Logic:** The contract itself calculates winners based on the complex entanglement rules after revelation.
5.  **Role-Based Access:** Admin functions are separate from bidder functions.

/**
 * @notice Function Summary
 *
 * Admin Functions:
 * - constructor: Deploys the contract and sets the owner.
 * - pauseAuction: Pauses the auction in case of emergency.
 * - unpauseAuction: Unpauses the auction.
 * - cancelAuction: Cancels the entire auction, allowing refunds.
 * - addItem: Adds a new item to be auctioned (only during Setup).
 * - removeItem: Removes an item (only during Setup).
 * - linkItemsForEntanglement: Defines which items are entangled (only during Setup). A bidder cannot win ALL items in a linked group.
 * - setPhaseDurations: Sets the time limits for Commitment and Reveal phases (only during Setup).
 * - startCommitmentPhase: Transitions the auction from Setup to Commitment.
 * - forcePhaseTransition: Owner can force moving to the next phase (use with extreme caution).
 * - withdrawAdminFees: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated fees/profits.
 *
 * Bidder Functions:
 * - registerForAuction: Allows an address to register as a valid bidder (if required).
 * - submitBidCommitment: Submits a hashed bid during the Commitment phase. Requires depositing commitment fee.
 * - updateBidCommitment: Updates a previously submitted commitment (if allowed).
 * - revealBid: Reveals the actual bid amount and salt during the Reveal phase. Requires depositing the bid amount.
 * - cancelBidCommitment: Withdraws a commitment before revealing (might incur penalty).
 * - settleAuctionForBidder: Allows a winning bidder to claim their item and losing bidders to get refunds after Finalization.
 *
 * Phase Transition & Resolution Logic:
 * - advanceToRevealPhase: Public function to trigger transition from Commitment to Reveal if time is up.
 * - advanceToResolutionPhase: Public function to trigger transition from Reveal to Resolution if time is up.
 * - finalizeAuction: Triggers the final calculation of winners and moves to Finalized state. (Can be triggered by owner or after Resolution phase time).
 * - _resolveEntanglements: Internal logic for calculating final winners based on bids and entanglement rules.
 * - _distributeItemsAndFunds: Internal logic for handling asset/ether transfers post-resolution.
 *
 * Query Functions:
 * - getAuctionState: Returns the current phase of the auction.
 * - getItemDetails: Returns details about a specific item.
 * - getBidCommitment: Returns the commitment details for a specific bidder on an item (only the hash and bidder).
 * - getBidRevealStatus: Checks if a bidder's bid for an item has been revealed.
 * - getWinningBids: Returns the determined winning bid details after the Resolution phase.
 * - getEntangledGroups: Returns the defined entangled groups.
 * - getRegisteredBidders: Returns the list of registered bidders.
 * - getPhaseTimestamps: Returns the start and end times for each phase.
 * - getBidDetails: Returns details of a revealed bid (only after reveal phase).
 *
 * Utility Functions:
 * - _checkPhaseTimeouts: Internal helper to check if a phase has timed out.

**Explanation and Rationale:**

1.  **`AuctionState` Enum:** Clearly defines the lifecycle of the auction, controlling which actions are allowed when.
2.  **Commitment/Reveal:** Bidders first submit a hash (`submitBidCommitment`) committing to a bid amount and salt without revealing the value. This costs a small fee (`commitmentFee`). Later, during the Reveal phase, they must reveal the actual amount and salt (`revealBid`). The contract verifies the hash. This ensures bidders can't react to others' exact bids during the commitment phase.
3.  **Entanglement (`linkItemsForEntanglement`, `_resolveEntanglements`):** This is the core "quantum" inspired part. You can link groups of items. The `_resolveEntanglements` function iterates through revealed bids and applies the rule: if a bidder is the highest bidder on *multiple* items within a single entangled group, only their *single highest* bid among those items remains valid; the others are disqualified. This adds significant complexity to the winner determination logic beyond a simple "highest bid wins" for each item independently.
4.  **Phased Transitions:** The auction doesn't automatically jump phases based on time alone. Public functions (`advanceToRevealPhase`, `advanceToResolutionPhase`) can be called by *anyone* once the required time has passed, allowing for decentralized triggering of phase changes. The owner can also force transitions (`forcePhaseTransition`).
5.  **Resolution Phase:** A dedicated phase (`AuctionState.Resolution`) exists *after* all bids are revealed but *before* finalization. This is where the `_resolveEntanglements` logic runs to determine the *actual* winners, taking into account the entanglement rules.
6.  **Finalization (`finalizeAuction`):** This function locks in the winners determined in the Resolution phase and transitions to the `Finalized` state. It doesn't transfer assets yet.
7.  **Settlement (`settleAuctionForBidder`):** After finalization, winners and losers call this function to receive their won items (simulated here, would involve token transfers) or get their bid amounts refunded. Admin fees are taken *from* the winning bid amount during settlement.
8.  **Registration (`registerForAuction`):** An optional simple step to restrict bidding to known addresses if needed (though this example allows anyone to register).
9.  **Admin Controls:** Standard pause/unpause/cancel/withdraw functions are included for managing the auction lifecycle and collected fees.
10. **Query Functions:** A rich set of `view` functions allows anyone to inspect the auction state, item details, bid statuses, and final results.
11. **Gas Considerations:** The `_resolveEntanglements` function involves nested loops iterating through items, bidders, and entangled groups. For a very large number of items or bidders/entangled groups, this could become gas-intensive. The current implementation of the entanglement rule (checking highest bids *within* a group per bidder) is an attempt to keep complexity manageable, but still requires careful consideration for scale.

This contract provides a more complex auction dynamic than typical examples by incorporating commitment/reveal, multiple items, phase management, and a specific, non-trivial rule based on "entanglement" to influence outcomes.
