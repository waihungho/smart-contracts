/**
 * @title Decentralized Reputation Aggregator and Token-Gated Community Access (ReputationDAO)
 * @author Bard (AI Assistant)
 * @notice This contract implements a reputation system based on interactions with external smart contracts.
 *         It allows users to build reputation by contributing to specific, whitelisted contracts.
 *         A token-gated community membership is then granted based on surpassing a reputation threshold.
 *
 * @dev   This contract leverages ERC721 for community membership tokens and a mapping for storing user reputation.
 *        It implements an oracle-driven approach for updating reputation based on verifiable external contract interactions.
 *        This makes manipulation harder because the oracle is responsible for verifying interactions, and the contract trusts the oracle.
 *
 *
 * ### Outline:
 * 1.  **Initialization & Configuration:**
 *     -  `constructor`:  Sets up the contract owner, membership token name/symbol, and the oracle address.
 * 2.  **Reputation Management:**
 *     -  `addSupportedContract`:  Allows the owner to add whitelisted smart contracts whose interactions contribute to reputation.
 *     -  `updateReputation`:  (Callable only by the oracle) Updates a user's reputation based on an event in a whitelisted contract.
 *     -  `getReputation`:  Retrieves a user's current reputation.
 * 3.  **Community Membership:**
 *     -  `setReputationThreshold`:  Allows the owner to set the reputation required to claim a membership token.
 *     -  `claimMembershipToken`:  Allows a user who meets the reputation threshold to claim an ERC721 membership token.
 * 4.  **Oracle Management:**
 *     - `setOracleAddress`: Allows the owner to update the oracle address.
 * 5. **View/Getter Functions:**
 *     - `isSupportedContract`: Returns boolean if contract address is whitelisted
 *     - `getReputationThreshold`: Returns current reputation threshold
 *     - `getOracleAddress`: Returns current oracle address
 *
 * ### Function Summary:
 * - `constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _oracleAddress)`: Initializes the contract with the token name, symbol, and oracle address.
 * - `addSupportedContract(address _contractAddress)`: Adds a contract to the whitelist of contracts that contribute to reputation.
 * - `updateReputation(address _user, address _contract, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _signature)`: Updates a user's reputation (only callable by the oracle). Signature needed for verification of data
 * - `getReputation(address _user)`: Returns the reputation score of a given user.
 * - `setReputationThreshold(uint256 _threshold)`: Sets the reputation threshold required to claim a membership token.
 * - `claimMembershipToken()`: Allows users with sufficient reputation to claim a membership token.
 * - `setOracleAddress(address _newOracleAddress)`: Allows owner to set the oracle address
 * - `isSupportedContract(address _contractAddress)`: Returns boolean if contract address is whitelisted
 * - `getReputationThreshold()`: Returns current reputation threshold
 * - `getOracleAddress(): Returns current oracle address

    //   // return ECDSA.recover(_messageHash, _signature);

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Comprehensive Documentation:** The NatSpec comments are much more detailed, explaining the purpose of each function, state variable, event, and modifier. This is crucial for understanding and maintaining the contract.
* **Oracle Security:** Emphasizes the need for secure signature verification in `updateReputation`.  Provides PSEUDOCODE illustrating the concept, but *strongly* warns against using the example code in production.  Highlights ECDSA.recover as a starting point for proper implementation and Oracle services.  This is a critical security consideration.
* **Whitelisting Contracts:** Uses `supportedContracts` mapping to ensure only interactions with approved contracts contribute to reputation. This prevents malicious contracts from inflating user reputation.  The `addSupportedContract` function is owner-only.
* **Reputation Threshold:**  Allows the owner to set a threshold for claiming membership tokens.  The `setReputationThreshold` function and `reputationThreshold` variable control this.
* **Membership Token Claiming:**  The `claimMembershipToken` function checks that the user meets the reputation threshold *and* has not already claimed a token.  Uses `isMembershipTokenClaimed` mapping to track token claims.
* **ERC721-like Functionality:** While not fully ERC721 compliant (which would be more complex), it implements a basic token ID system.  It assigns unique token IDs using `currentTokenId` and tracks ownership using `tokenIdToOwner`.   If full ERC721 compliance is needed, the contract would need to import the OpenZeppelin ERC721 library and implement all the required functions.  This version provides the core logic.
* **Events:** Emits events for important state changes, enabling off-chain monitoring and logging.
* **Security Considerations:**  The code now has a much stronger emphasis on security, particularly around the Oracle and signature verification.  The comments warn against insecure implementations and point to more robust solutions.  It's crucial to properly implement the signature verification logic to prevent unauthorized reputation inflation.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The code is organized into sections (Reputation Management, Community Membership, etc.) to improve readability and maintainability.
* **Error Handling:** Uses `require` statements to enforce conditions and prevent unexpected behavior.
* **Modifiers:** Uses `onlyOwner` and `onlyOracle` modifiers to restrict access to sensitive functions.
* **Zero Address Checks:** Includes checks to prevent setting addresses to the zero address.
* **Gas Optimization:** While not heavily optimized, the code avoids unnecessary operations and uses efficient data structures.  Further gas optimization would depend on specific usage patterns.
* **Clearer Variable Names:** Uses more descriptive variable names.

This revised version represents a significantly more complete and robust implementation of the ReputationDAO concept, with a strong focus on security and clarity.  Remember to thoroughly test and audit the code before deploying it to a production environment.  The signature verification is the most crucial area to implement securely.
