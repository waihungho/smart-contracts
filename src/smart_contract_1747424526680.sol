Okay, this is a challenging but fun request! Creating a smart contract with an advanced, creative, trendy concept, *without* duplicating any open source code (which is tricky for fundamental patterns like ownership or ERC20 interfaces), and requiring at least 20 functions, pushes the boundaries.

Let's conceptualize something that combines dynamic access control, on-chain reputation, conditional logic based on time/events, and perhaps a basic form of dynamic pricing or parameter adjustment.

**Concept:** A "Decentralized Access & Reputation Gateway" (DARG).
Users stake a specific ERC20 token to gain access to different tiers of functionality or data *within this contract*. Access is determined by a combined "Effective Score" based on staked amount and an on-chain reputation score. The contract dynamically adjusts certain parameters based on internal state or hypothetical external signals. It also includes conditional execution functions.

**Advanced Concepts:**
1.  **Reputation System:** On-chain, non-transferable score tied to an address, influenced by staking duration, successful interactions, or admin actions.
2.  **Dynamic Tiered Access:** Access tiers determined by a formula combining stake and reputation, requiring a custom modifier.
3.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Contract parameters (like reputation weight, tier thresholds, access fees) can be adjusted via an internal "optimization" logic (simulated) or admin control.
4.  **Conditional Execution:** Functions that only run if specific on-chain conditions (timestamp, block number, total value locked) are met.
5.  **Delegation:** Allowing users to delegate their combined access score to another address.

**Constraints & Workarounds ("No Open Source"):**
*   Standard interfaces like `IERC20` are technically "open source". However, they are fundamental definitions. I will use the interface definition directly in the code rather than importing from OpenZeppelin. This is a practical compromise.
*   Basic patterns like `Ownable` are common. I will implement a simple owner check manually instead of inheriting `Ownable`.
*   Safe Math: Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow checks, reducing the need for `SafeMath` libraries.
*   Token interactions: Standard `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`. Will handle return values where necessary.

**Outline & Function Summary:**

**Contract Name:** DecentralizedAccessReputationGateway (DARG)

**Concept:** A gateway contract where users stake an ERC20 token to build reputation and gain tiered access to contract functionalities or signal access to external systems. Access is based on a combined stake and reputation score. Contract parameters can dynamically adjust. Includes conditional execution triggers and access delegation.

**Core Components:**
1.  **Staking:** Users stake a designated ERC20 token.
2.  **Reputation:** An on-chain score increasing over time staked or adjusted by admin.
3.  **Access Tiers:** Multiple tiers requiring minimum Effective Score (Stake + Reputation).
4.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Adjustable values (reputation weight, tier thresholds, access fees).
5.  **Delegation:** Users can delegate their access score.
6.  **Conditional Execution:** Functions triggered by time, block, or state conditions.

**State Variables:**
*   `owner`: Contract owner.
*   `stakeToken`: Address of the staked ERC20 token.
*   `stakes`: Mapping from user address to staked amount.
*   `reputationScores`: Mapping from user address to reputation points.
*   `stakeStartTime`: Mapping from user address to timestamp when they first staked or last claimed reputation/rewards.
*   `delegates`: Mapping from delegator address to delegatee address.
*   `effectiveScoreWeight`: Weight of stake vs. reputation in calculating effective score.
*   `reputationGainRatePerSecond`: Reputation points gained per staked token per second.
*   `earlyUnstakePenaltyRate`: Percentage of stake lost for early unstake.
*   `minScoresForTiers`: Array defining minimum effective scores for each tier.
*   `accessFeesPerTier`: Array defining fee (in stakeToken) to call a tiered function.
*   `totalStaked`: Total amount of stakeToken locked in the contract.

**Events:**
*   `Staked(address indexed user, uint256 amount)`
*   `Unstaked(address indexed user, uint256 amount)`
*   `ReputationUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 newReputation)`
*   `TierAccessGranted(address indexed user, uint256 tier)`
*   `ParameterUpdated(string parameterName, uint256 newValue)`
*   `DelegationUpdated(address indexed delegator, address indexed delegatee)`
*   `ConditionalExecutionTriggered(bytes32 indexed conditionId, bytes data)`

**Modifiers:**
*   `onlyOwner`: Restricts function access to the contract owner.
*   `hasAccessTier(uint256 requiredTier)`: Restricts function access based on user's or delegatee's effective score.

**Explanation and Notes:**

1.  **No Open Source?** I've avoided importing standard libraries like OpenZeppelin. `IERC20` is defined inline, and `Ownable` logic is manual. This is a *very strict* interpretation of the rule. In practice, using battle-tested libraries is highly recommended for security.
2.  **Complexity:** This contract combines multiple concepts. This increases complexity, potential attack surface, and gas costs compared to single-purpose contracts.
3.  **Reputation Calculation:** Reputation gain (`calculateReputationGain`) is based on `stakeAmount * rate * timeElapsed`. `_updateReputation` is called internally during state changes (stake, unstake, admin adjustments) to "claim" the pending reputation gain and reset the timer (`stakeUpdateTime`). `getReputation` also calculates pending gain on the fly for the most current score.
4.  **Effective Score:** `getEffectiveScore` combines stake and reputation using a configurable weight (`effectiveScoreWeight`).
5.  **Dynamic Parameters:** Admin functions allow setting various parameters. `optimizeParameters` includes *placeholder* logic to show *how* parameters *could* be adjusted based on state. A real system might use Oracles (like Chainlink) or complex game theory.
6.  **Tiered Access:** `minScoresForTiers` defines the thresholds. `getAccessTier` finds the highest tier met. `hasAccessTier` modifier checks the tier, considering delegation, and calls the `getEffectiveAccessTier` helper.
7.  **Access Fees:** The placeholder `accessTierXFeature` functions demonstrate charging a fee in the staked token for accessing the feature. These fees accrue in the contract, and their use (e.g., redistribution, burning, funding development) would need to be defined elsewhere.
8.  **Delegation:** Simple mapping allows one-to-one delegation of the *access score*. The delegatee gets the delegator's score.
9.  **Conditional Execution:** `executeAfterTimestamp`, `executeAfterBlock`, and `executeIfTotalStakeAbove` show how functions can be gated by arbitrary on-chain conditions. The `data` parameter is a common pattern for passing arbitrary instructions or parameters to the triggered logic. In this example, it just emits the data.
10. **Gas Costs:** Be aware that loops (e.g., in `getAccessTier` if `minScoresForTiers` is long) and state updates can be gas-intensive.
11. **Security:** This is an example. A production contract would require extensive auditing, formal verification, and potentially more robust error handling and edge case management (e.g., what happens if the stake token is malicious?). The manual ERC20 `transferFrom`/`transfer` calls don't include the `SafeERC20` checks for faulty tokens, which is another compromise made to adhere to the "no open source" rule strictly.
12. **Function Count:** The contract includes 29 public/external functions and several internal/private helpers, exceeding the requirement of 20.

This contract provides a framework for a system where access is a dynamic privilege earned through participation and reputation, with parameters that can potentially evolve.
