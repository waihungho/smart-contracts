Okay, let's create a smart contract concept that deals with decentralized negotiation and conditional access to off-chain content or services, incorporating elements of escrow, proof verification, state machines, and external arbitration hooks.

This avoids simple token standards, basic marketplaces, or generic DAOs. It focuses on a protocol for *reaching and enforcing complex agreements* about *something external* to the blockchain, verified *on-chain* via proofs.

**Concept:** Decentralized Content/Service Negotiation Protocol (DCNP)

**Core Idea:** A protocol where creators can list content/services with specific access requirements (terms), consumers can negotiate these terms, and agreements are formed on-chain. Access is granted/verified only after the consumer provides verifiable proof (e.g., a hash of a signed document, a zero-knowledge proof, a transaction ID on another chain) that they have met the agreed-upon off-chain or complex on-chain conditions. The contract manages escrowed funds tied to the agreement's fulfillment status and provides a hook for external dispute resolution.

**Outline:**

1.  **Enums:** Define states for Negotiations and Agreements.
2.  **Structs:** Define `Terms`, `ContentListing`, `Negotiation`, `Agreement`.
3.  **Events:** For key state transitions and actions.
4.  **Interfaces:** For interacting with external ERC20 tokens and a hypothetical Arbitrator contract.
5.  **State Variables:** Mappings to store Content Listings, Negotiations, Agreements; tracking IDs; admin/arbitrator addresses.
6.  **Modifiers:** For access control (only parties, only admin, only arbitrator).
7.  **Constructor:** Set initial admin and arbitrator.
8.  **Content Listing Functions:** Creator adds, updates, removes content listings.
9.  **Negotiation Functions:** Consumer proposes, Creator counters/accepts/rejects, Consumer accepts/rejects counter, either cancels. State machine transitions are critical here.
10. **Agreement Functions:** Finalization happens upon negotiation acceptance. Consumer submits fulfillment proof. Creator/Oracle verifies proof.
11. **Funds Management Functions:** Handling escrowed funds (ETH/ERC20) based on agreement state (release on fulfillment, refund on failure/cancellation/dispute resolution).
12. **Dispute Resolution Functions:** Consumer/Creator raises dispute. Arbitrator resolves, leading to fund release/refund.
13. **Administrative Functions:** Set arbitrator address.
14. **View Functions:** Get details of listings, negotiations, agreements; check states; list user interactions.

**Function Summary:**

1.  `constructor(address _arbitrator)`: Initializes the contract, setting the initial admin (deployer) and external arbitrator contract address.
2.  `listContent(bytes32 contentId, Terms initialTerms)`: Creator lists new content/service with initial terms. `contentId` is an external identifier (e.g., IPFS hash, URL hash).
3.  `updateContentTerms(bytes32 contentId, Terms newTerms)`: Creator updates the terms for an existing content listing.
4.  `removeContentListing(bytes32 contentId)`: Creator removes a content listing, preventing new negotiations. Active negotiations/agreements are unaffected.
5.  `proposeNegotiation(bytes32 contentId, Terms proposedTerms)`: Consumer initiates a negotiation for specific content, proposing their desired terms. Requires staking funds if terms include payment.
6.  `counterProposal(bytes32 negotiationId, Terms counterTerms)`: Creator responds to a `PROPOSED` negotiation with counter-terms.
7.  `acceptTerms(bytes32 negotiationId)`: A party accepts the latest terms proposed by the other party. If accepted by the second party, the negotiation transitions to an `AGREED` state and an `Agreement` is created. Requires staking funds if terms include payment upon consumer acceptance.
8.  `rejectProposal(bytes32 negotiationId)`: A party rejects the latest terms proposed by the other party, ending the negotiation in a `REJECTED` state. Refunds staked funds.
9.  `cancelNegotiation(bytes32 negotiationId)`: Either party cancels a negotiation before terms are fully accepted. Ends in `CANCELLED` state. Refunds staked funds.
10. `submitProofOfFulfillment(bytes32 agreementId, bytes32 fulfillmentProofHash)`: Consumer submits a hash referencing the off-chain proof that they met the agreement conditions.
11. `verifyFulfillment(bytes32 agreementId, bytes32 fulfillmentProofHash, bool success)`: Called *only* by the designated arbitrator or a trusted oracle system (configured externally) to signal whether the submitted proof for an agreement is valid or not. Transitions agreement state to `FULFILLED` or potentially `DISPUTED`.
12. `raiseDispute(bytes32 agreementId)`: Either party initiates a dispute about an active or recently unfulfilled agreement. Transitions agreement to `DISPUTED` state.
13. `resolveDispute(bytes32 agreementId, bool creatorWins)`: Called *only* by the designated arbitrator contract to finalize a dispute. Based on the resolution (`creatorWins`), funds are released to the creator or refunded to the consumer. Transitions agreement to `RESOLVED`.
14. `releaseFunds(bytes32 agreementId)`: Called by the creator or automatically after the agreement is marked `FULFILLED` and a timelock (if any) expires. Transfers escrowed funds to the creator.
15. `refundFunds(bytes32 agreementId)`: Called by the consumer or automatically after the agreement is marked `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED`, or `RESOLVED` in favor of the consumer. Refunds escrowed funds to the consumer.
16. `setArbitrator(address newArbitrator)`: Admin function to update the address of the trusted arbitrator contract.
17. `getContentDetails(bytes32 contentId)`: View function to get the state and terms of a content listing.
18. `getNegotiationDetails(bytes32 negotiationId)`: View function to get the full details of a specific negotiation.
19. `getAgreementDetails(bytes32 agreementId)`: View function to get the full details of a specific agreement.
20. `getNegotiationState(bytes32 negotiationId)`: View function to get only the current state of a negotiation.
21. `getAgreementState(bytes32 agreementId)`: View function to get only the current state of an agreement.
22. `getUserActiveNegotiations(address user)`: View function (might require indexing or pagination in production) to list active negotiations involving the user.
23. `getUserActiveAgreements(address user)`: View function (might require indexing or pagination) to list active agreements involving the user.
24. `listContentByCreator(address creator)`: View function (might require indexing or pagination) to list content IDs created by an address.
25. `getEscrowedAmount(bytes32 agreementOrNegotiationId)`: View function to check the amount of funds currently held in escrow for a specific negotiation or agreement.

    // - Timelocks for fund release after fulfillment verified.
    // - More robust indexing for user/content lookups (e.g., using libraries like EnumerableSet or external graph indexers).
    // - More complex Terms conditions and on-chain verification logic (e.g., checking ERC721 ownership, specific contract state).
    // - Handling of multiple ERC20 token types per agreement.
    // - Proper implementation of IArbitrator callback or ERC-792 integration.
    // - Pausability/Upgradeability.
    // - Gas optimizations for mappings/storage.
    // - More detailed state tracking (e.g., which party accepted/countered last).
    // - Reputation tracking based on successful agreements.
