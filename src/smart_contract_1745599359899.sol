Okay, let's design a "Decentralized Autonomous Portfolio" (DAP) smart contract. This contract will act as a community-governed vault holding various assets (ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFTs). Governance will be managed by holders of a specific governance token, allowing them to propose and vote on actions like rebalancing the portfolio, adding/removing assets, changing parameters, or even distributing yield.

This design incorporates several advanced concepts:
1.  **On-chain Governance:** A full proposal, voting, queuing, and execution cycle.
2.  **Portfolio Management:** Handling deposits and governance-controlled transfers/withdrawals of heterogeneous assets (ERC-20 & ERC-721).
3.  **Staking with Cooldown:** Users stake governance tokens for voting power, with a mandatory cooldown period for unstaking.
4.  **Generic Proposal Execution:** Using `call` to execute arbitrary functions on target contracts (including internal functions of the DAP contract itself) via governance.
5.  **Role-Based Actions:** Basic admin role for setup, and governance for sensitive operations.
6.  **Asset Whitelisting:** Only approved assets can be deposited or managed.
7.  **Time Locks:** Delays between proposal success and execution for security.

This contract aims for complexity by combining these elements into a single functional unit, distinct from standard DAO or portfolio management examples which often focus on a single asset type or simpler governance.

## Smart Contract Outline & Function Summary

**Contract Name:** `DecentralizedAutonomousPortfolio`

**Description:** A smart contract acting as a community-governed portfolio vault for whitelisted ERC-20 tokens and ERC-721 NFTs. Governance is conducted via proposals and voting using a designated ERC-20 governance token.

**Key Concepts:** On-chain governance, asset management (ERC20, ERC721), staking with cooldown, generic call execution via governance, asset whitelisting, timelocks.

**Outline:**

1.  **State Variables & Data Structures:** Defines contract state, including asset lists, proposal details, user stakes, and governance parameters.
2.  **Events:** Emits events for key actions (deposits, withdrawals, staking, proposals, votes, execution).
3.  **Modifiers:** Custom modifiers for access control and state checks.
4.  **Constructor:** Initializes the contract with the governance token and initial admin.
5.  **Admin & Setup Functions:** Functions accessible by the admin role (e.g., whitelisting assets).
6.  **Asset Management (Portfolio) Functions:** Handling deposits into the contract. (Withdrawals are governance actions).
7.  **Governance Token & Staking Functions:** Allowing users to stake, unstake, claim, and delegate voting power.
8.  **Proposal Management Functions:** Creating, voting on, and transitioning proposals through their lifecycle.
9.  **Proposal Execution Target Functions:** Internal functions that are *only* callable by the `executeProposal` function via governance (e.g., transferring assets out, changing governance config).
10. **View Functions:** Public read-only functions to query the contract state.

**Function Summary:**

*   `constructor(address _governanceToken, address _admin)`: Initializes contract with governance token and admin address.
*   `addWhitelistedAsset(address asset)`: Admin adds an asset (ERC20/ERC721) to the whitelist.
*   `removeWhitelistedAsset(address asset)`: Admin removes an asset from the whitelist.
*   `isAssetWhitelisted(address asset)`: Checks if an asset is whitelisted. (View)
*   `depositERC20(address token, uint256 amount)`: Users deposit whitelisted ERC-20 tokens into the portfolio.
*   `depositERC721(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)`: Users deposit whitelisted ERC-721 NFTs into the portfolio.
*   `stakeGovernanceToken(uint256 amount)`: Users stake governance tokens to gain voting power.
*   `unstakeGovernanceToken(uint256 amount)`: Users initiate the unstaking process, triggering a cooldown period.

        // REFINEMENT: Let's make `unstakeGovernanceToken` *move* the tokens to a temporary holding state within the contract
        // and track the amount & cooldown for each user.

        // Re-implementing with tracking:
        // We need a separate mapping or struct to track tokens pending claim.

        // The cooldown applies to the *latest* unstake request. This is still simple.
        // A better pattern: `mapping(address => struct Claim { uint256 amount; uint40 unlockTime; }[]) userClaims;`

        // Let's stick to the original simpler idea to manage complexity for 20+ functions:
        // `unstakeGovernanceToken` reduces `userStakes` and sets the cooldown timestamp.
        // `claimUnstakedTokens` requires cooldown finished and `userStakes[msg.sender]` being less than initial total stake (which we don't track easily).

        // ALTERNATIVE SIMPLER CLAIM: `unstakeGovernanceToken` moves tokens to a `pendingClaim` pool for the user, and `claimUnstakedTokens` transfers them after cooldown.

        // Let's go with this simpler, more robust approach:
        // User calls `unstakeGovernanceToken(amount)`: `userStakes[msg.sender]` decreases, `userPendingClaim[msg.sender] += amount`, `userUnstakeCooldowns[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + cooldown`.
        // User calls `claimUnstakedTokens()`: requires `block.timestamp >= userUnstakeCooldowns[msg.sender]` and `userPendingClaim[msg.sender] > 0`. Transfers `userPendingClaim[msg.sender]` to user and sets `userPendingClaim[msg.sender] = 0`.

        uint256 amountToClaim = userStakes[msg.sender]; // Amount *currently available* to claim based on simple model
        // This simple model doesn't work if user stakes/unstakes multiple times.
        // Let's revert to the most common pattern: user stake balance goes down, they can claim *up to* that amount after cooldown.
        // Let's assume `userStakes[msg.sender]` represents *active, votable* stake.
        // `unstakeGovernanceToken` reduces `userStakes` and sets cooldown.
        // `claimUnstakedTokens` needs to know *how much* was put into cooldown.
        // This needs a separate variable: `mapping(address => uint256) public userTokensInCooldown;`

        // Let's try again with `userTokensInCooldown`:
        // `stakeGovernanceToken(amount)`: `userStakes += amount`.
        // `unstakeGovernanceToken(amount)`: `userStakes -= amount`, `userTokensInCooldown += amount`, `userUnstakeCooldowns = block.timestamp + cooldown`.
        // `claimUnstakedTokens()`: requires `block.timestamp >= userUnstakeCooldowns`, `userTokensInCooldown > 0`. Transfer `userTokensInCooldown`, `userTokensInCooldown = 0`, `userUnstakeCooldowns = 0`. This only works for one cooldown batch at a time.

        // Okay, standard pattern using one variable for total "locked" (staked + cooldown):
        // `mapping(address => uint256) public userLockedTokens;`
        // `mapping(address => uint256) public userUnlockedTime;` (time when *all* locked tokens become claimable)
        // `stake`: `userLockedTokens += amount`
        // `unstake`: `userUnlockedTime = block.timestamp + cooldown`. Amount is implicitly the *total* `userLockedTokens` at that time.
        // `claim`: requires `block.timestamp >= userUnlockedTime` and `userLockedTokens > 0`. Transfer `userLockedTokens`, `userLockedTokens = 0`, `userUnlockedTime = 0`.
        // Voting power: `userLockedTokens` *unless* they initiated unstake and are in cooldown? No, power should drop immediately on unstake.

     * No, standard DAOs sum up delegates. Let's assume the governance token contract handles delegation and balance tracking.
     * If the Gov token is standard ERC20, we must track stakes here.

     *
     * REFINEMENT: Let's use the `delegates` mapping correctly. `getVotingPower(address)` returns stake *unless* they are delegating.

     * The delegatee's power is their own stake + sum of all stakes delegated *to* them.
     * This requires tracking who delegates to whom and summing stakes.
     * A standard ERC20 doesn't easily support this. A Governor-compatible token does (`getVotes`).
     * Let's *assume* the governance token is compatible with a `getVotes(address)` function for voting power.
     * If not, this function would need significant internal stake aggregation logic based on `delegates`.
     * For the sake of hitting function count and demonstrating the concept, let's assume `governanceToken` has a `getVotes` function.
     * If it's just ERC20, `getVotingPower` must return `userStakes[user]` if they haven't delegated, and 0 if they have.
     * Let's use the simpler model tied to the stake held in *this* contract.
     * `getVotingPower(user)` returns `userStakes[user]`. Delegation determines *who calls* `vote()`.
